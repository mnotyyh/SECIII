"Super-resolution image reconstruction: a technical overview","Sung Cheol Park; Min Kyu Park; Moon Gi Kang","NA; NA; NA","IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","","2003","20","3","21","36","A new approach toward increasing spatial resolution is required to overcome the limitations of the sensors and optics manufacturing technology. One promising approach is to use signal processing techniques to obtain an high-resolution (HR) image (or sequence) from observed multiple low-resolution (LR) images. Such a resolution enhancement approach has been one of the most active research areas, and it is called super resolution (SR) (or HR) image reconstruction or simply resolution enhancement. In this article, we use the term ""SR image reconstruction"" to refer to a signal processing approach toward resolution enhancement because the term ""super"" in ""super resolution"" represents very well the characteristics of the technique overcoming the inherent resolution limitation of LR imaging systems. The major advantage of the signal processing approach is that it may cost less and the existing LR imaging systems can be still utilized. The SR image reconstruction is proved to be useful in many practical cases where multiple frames of the same scene can be obtained, including medical imaging, satellite imaging, and video applications. The goal of this article is to introduce the concept of SR algorithms to readers who are unfamiliar with this area and to provide a review for experts. To this purpose, we present the technical review of various existing SR methodologies which are often employed. Before presenting the review of existing SR algorithms, we first model the LR image acquisition process.","1558-0792","","10.1109/MSP.2003.1203207","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1203207","","Image resolution;Image reconstruction;Signal resolution;Strontium;Spatial resolution;Optical imaging;Optical sensors;Optical signal processing;Signal processing algorithms;Biomedical optical imaging","image reconstruction;image resolution;image enhancement;reviews","super-resolution image reconstruction;spatial resolution;sensors;optics;manufacturing technology;signal processing;low-resolution images;resolution enhancement;SR image reconstruction;LR imaging systems;medical imaging;satellite imaging;video applications;SR algorithms;LR image acquisition;high-resolution image","","1923","","79","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This paper reviews various transistor intrinsic leakage mechanisms, including weak inversion, drain-induced barrier lowering, gate-induced drain leakage, and gate oxide tunneling. Channel engineering techniques including retrograde well and halo doping are explained as means to manage short-channel effects for continuous scaling of CMOS devices.

"IEEE Standard for Interconnecting Distributed Resources with Electric Power Systems","","","IEEE Std 1547-2003","","2003","","","1","28","This standard is the first in the 1547 series of interconnection standards and is a benchmark milestone demonstrating the open consensus process for standards development. Traditionally, utility electric power systems (EPS--grid or utility grid) were not designed to accommodate active generation and storage at the distribution level. As a result, there are major issues and obstacles to an orderly transition to using and integrating distributed power resources with the grid. The lack of uniform national interconnection standards and tests for interconnection operation and certification, as well as the lack of uniform national building, electrical, and safety codes, are understood. IEEE Std 1547 and its development demonstrate a model for ongoing success in establishing additional interconnection agreements, rules, and standards, on a national, regional, and state level. IEEE Std 1547 has the potential to be used in federal legislation and rule making and state public utilities commission (PUC) deliberations, and by over 3000 utilities in formulating technical requirements for interconnection agreements for distributed generators powering the electric grid. This standard focuses on the technical specifications for, and testing of, the interconnection itself. It provides requirements relevant to the performance, operation, testing, safety considerations, and maintenance of the interconnection. It includes general requirements, response to abnormal conditions, power quality, islanding, and test specifications and requirements for design, production, installation evaluation, commissioning, and periodic tests. The stated requirements are universally needed for interconnection of distributed resources (DR), including synchronous machines, induction machines, or power inverters/converters and will be sufficient for most installations.","","978-0-7381-3721-6","10.1109/IEEESTD.2003.94285","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1225051","certification codes commissioning;dc injection design;field;installation;production tests communications diesel generators distributed generation;power resources electric distribution systems dispersed generation;storage energy storage faults flicker fuel cells generators grid harmonics IEEE induction machines inverters interconnection requirements and specifications islanding microturbines monitoring and control paralleling power converters;networks;quality photovoltaic power systems point of common coupling public utility commissions reclosing coordination regulations rule making;federal;national;regional;state standards synchronous machines testing utilities wind energy systems","IEEE Standards;Power systems;Patents;Photovoltaic systems;Energy storage;Technical requirements","","","","80","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Standards"

The advent of fully implantable multielectrode arrays has created the need for fully integrated micropower amplifiers. We designed and tested a novel bioamplifier that uses a MOS-bipolar pseudoresistor element to amplify low-frequency signals down to the millihertz range while rejecting large dc offsets. We derive the theoretical noise-power tradeoff limit - the noise efficiency factor - for this amplifier and demonstrate that our VLSI implementation approaches this limit by selectively operating MOS transistors in either weak or strong inversion. The resulting amplifier, built in a standard 1.5-μm CMOS process, passes signals from 0.025Hz to 7.2 kHz with an input-referred noise of 2.2 μVrms and a power dissipation of 80 μW while consuming 0.16 mm2 of chip area. Our design technique was also used to develop an electroencephalogram amplifier having a bandwidth of 30 Hz and a power dissipation of 0.9 μW while maintaining a similar noise-power tradeoff.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2003.811979","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1201998","","Low-noise amplifiers;Low-frequency noise;Power amplifiers;Power dissipation;DC generators;Signal generators;Signal design;Testing;Very large scale integration;MOSFETs","biomedical electronics;prosthetics;CMOS analogue integrated circuits;low-power electronics;integrated circuit noise;integrated circuit design;preamplifiers;electroencephalography;operational amplifiers;neurophysiology","low-power low-noise CMOS amplifier;neural recording applications;low-noise low-power biosignal amplifiers;millihertz-to-kilohertz range;dc offset rejection;electrode-tissue interface;fully implantable multielectrode arrays;fully integrated micropower amplifiers;bioamplifier;MOS-bipolar pseudoresistor element;low-frequency signal amplification;noise-power tradeoff limit;noise efficiency factor;VLSI implementation;MOS transistor selective operation;weak inversion;strong inversion;CMOS process;input-referred noise;power dissipation;electroencephalogram amplifier;subthreshold circuit design;1.5 micron;0.025 Hz to 7.2 kHz;80 muW;30 Hz;0.9 muW","","1007","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We employ a metric derived from the Bhattacharyya coefficient as similarity measure, and use the mean shift procedure to perform the optimization. In the presented tracking examples, the new method successfully coped with camera motion, partial occlusions, clutter, and target scale variations.

Although enormous capacity gains have been predicted for such channels, these predictions are based on somewhat unrealistic assumptions about the underlying time-varying channel model and how well it can be tracked at the receiver, as well as at the transmitter. More realistic assumptions can dramatically impact the potential capacity gains of MIMO techniques. For time-varying MIMO channels there are multiple Shannon theoretic capacity definitions and, for each definition, different correlation models and channel information assumptions that we consider. We first provide a comprehensive summary of ergodic and capacity versus outage results for single-user MIMO channels. These results indicate that the capacity gain obtained from multiple antennas heavily depends on the available channel information at either the receiver or transmitter, the channel signal-to-noise ratio, and the correlation between the channel gains on each antenna element. We then focus attention on the capacity region of the multiple-access channels (MACs) and the largest known achievable rate region for the broadcast channel. In contrast to single-user MIMO channels, capacity results for these multiuser MIMO channels are quite difficult to obtain, even for constant channels. We summarize results for the MIMO broadcast and MAC for channels that are either constant or fading with perfect instantaneous knowledge of the antenna gains at both transmitter(s) and receiver(s). We show that the capacity region of the MIMO multiple access and the largest known achievable rate region (called the dirty-paper region) for the MIMO broadcast channel are intimately related via a duality transformation. This transformation facilitates finding the transmission strategies that achieve a point on the boundary of the MIMO MAC capacity region in terms of the transmission strategies of the MIMO broadcast dirty-paper region and vice-versa. Finally, we discuss capacity results for multicell MIMO channels with base station cooperation. The base stations then act as a spatially diverse antenna array and transmission strategies that exploit this structure exhibit significant capacity gains. This section also provides a brief discussion of system level issues associated with MIMO cellular. Open problems in this field abound and are discussed throughout the paper.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2003.810294","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1203154","","MIMO;Transmitting antennas;Broadcasting;Receiving antennas;Channel capacity;Transmitters;Base stations;Time-varying channels;Predictive models;Signal to noise ratio","channel capacity;fading channels;time-varying channels;broadcast channels;MIMO systems;antenna arrays;receiving antennas;transmitting antennas;multiuser channels;multi-access systems;noise;cellular radio","capacity limits;multiuser MIMO channels;multiple-input multiple-output channels;Shannon capacity;single-user MIMO channels;capacity gain;time-varying channel model;receiver;transmitter;correlation models;channel information;multiple antennas;channel signal-to-noise ratio;capacity region;multiple-access channels;achievable rate region;broadcast channel;dirty-paper region;duality transformation;multicell MIMO channels;base station cooperation;antenna array;MIMO cellular;open problems;SNR;fading","","1437","","89","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Z-source converter overcomes the conceptual and theoretical barriers and limitations of the traditional voltage-source converter (abbreviated as V-source converter) and current-source converter (abbreviated as I-source converter) and provides a novel power conversion concept.

At Amazon.com, we use recommendation algorithms to personalize the online store for each customer. The store radically changes based on customer interests, showing programming titles to a software engineer and baby toys to a new mother. There are three common approaches to solving the recommendation problem: traditional collaborative filtering, cluster models, and search-based methods. Here, we compare these methods with our algorithm, which we call item-to-item collaborative filtering. Unlike traditional collaborative filtering, our algorithm's online computation scales independently of the number of customers and number of items in the product catalog.

This paper establishes a theoretical connection between these two classes of regulators and proposes a new type of stationary frame regulator, the P+Resonant regulator, which achieves the same transient and steady-state performance as a synchronous frame PI regulator. The new regulator is applicable to both single-phase and three phase inverters.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2003.810852","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1198060","","Current control;Pulse width modulation inverters;Steady-state;Regulators;Control systems;Pulse width modulation converters;Error correction;Servosystems;Resonance;Open loop systems","PWM invertors;DC-AC power convertors;control system synthesis;electric current control;two-term control;resonant power convertors","PWM inverters;stationary frame current regulation;current regulators;stationary ABC frame;synchronous d-q frame;current control performance;regulators;transient performance;steady-state performance;synchronous frame PI regulator","","946","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This filter, typically a series inductance, acts to reduce the switching harmonics entering the distribution network. An alternative filter is a LCL network, which can achieve reduced levels of harmonic distortion at lower switching frequencies and with less inductance, and therefore has potential benefits for higher power applications. However, systems incorporating LCL filters require more complex control strategies and are not commonly presented in literature. This paper proposes a robust strategy for regulating the grid current entering a distribution network from a three-phase VSI system connected via a LCL filter. The strategy integrates an outer loop grid current regulator with inner capacitor current regulation to stabilize the system. A synchronous frame PI current regulation strategy is used for the outer grid current control loop. Linear analysis, simulation, and experimental results are used to verify the stability of the control algorithm across a range of operating conditions. Finally, expressions for """"harmonic impedance"" of the system are derived to study the effects of supply voltage distortion on the harmonic performance of the system.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2003.810838","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1198069","","Current control;Inverters;Power harmonic filters;Inductance;Harmonic distortion;Power electronics;Automatic voltage control;Distributed control;Switching frequency;Control systems","invertors;power system interconnection;flexible AC transmission systems;power system harmonics;harmonic distortion;two-term control;electric current control;control system synthesis;control system analysis","three-phase voltage source inverter;LCL input filter;grid current regulation;grid connected power electronic systems;STATCOMs;UPFCs;distributed generation system interfaces;voltage source inverter;synchronous frame PI current regulation strategy;outer grid current control loop;harmonic impedance;supply voltage distortion;harmonic performance;series inductance;switching harmonies;distribution network","","591","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These require accurate models of doubly fed induction generator wind turbines and their associated control and protection circuits. A dynamic model has been derived, which can be used to simulate the DFIG wind turbine using a single-cage and double-cage representation of the generator rotor, as well as a representation of its control and protection circuits.

Its band-gap feature of surface-wave suppression is demonstrated by exhibiting the near field distributions of the electromagnetic waves. The mutual coupling of microstrip antennas is parametrically investigated, including both the E and H coupling directions, different substrate thickness, and various dielectric constants. It is observed that the E-plane coupled microstrip antenna array on a thick and high permittivity substrate has a strong mutual coupling due to the pronounced surface waves. Therefore, an EBG structure is inserted between array elements to reduce the mutual coupling. This idea has been verified by both the FDTD simulations and experimental results. As a result, a significant 8 dB mutual coupling reduction is noticed from the measurements.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2003.817983","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1236116","","Microstrip antenna arrays;Microstrip antennas;Periodic structures;Metamaterials;Mutual coupling;Finite difference methods;Time domain analysis;Surface waves;Dielectric substrates;Photonic band gap","microstrip antenna arrays;finite difference time-domain analysis;electromagnetic coupling","microstrip antennas;electromagnetic band-gap structures;EBG structures;mutual coupling design;mushroom-like structure;finite-difference time-domain method;FDTD method;surface-wave suppression;near field distributions;substrate thickness;dielectric constants;E-plane coupled microstrip antenna array","","734","","46","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this report, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent developments in the rapidly growing field of fractal antenna engineering. Fractal antenna engineering research has been primarily focused in two areas: the first deals with the analysis and design of fractal antenna elements, and the second concerns the application of fractal concepts to the design of antenna arrays. Fractals have no characteristic size, and are generally composed of many copies of themselves at different scales. These unique properties of fractals have been exploited in order to develop a new class of antenna-element designs that are multi-band and/or compact in size. On the other hand, fractal arrays are a subset of thinned arrays, and have been shown to possess several highly desirable properties, including multi-band performance, low sidelobe levels, and the ability to develop rapid beamforming algorithms based on the recursive nature of fractals. Fractal elements and arrays are also ideal candidates for use in reconfigurable systems. Finally, we provide a brief summary of recent work in the related area of fractal frequency-selective surfaces.","1558-4143","","10.1109/MAP.2003.1189650","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1189650","","Fractal antennas;Antenna theory;Geometry;Design engineering;Antennas and propagation;Antenna arrays;Electrodynamics;Electromagnetic scattering;Electromagnetic radiation;Laboratories","fractals;antenna arrays;reviews;antenna theory","fractal antenna engineering research;fractal geometry;electromagnetic theory;antenna designs;fractal antenna elements;antenna arrays;antenna-element designs;thinned arrays;multi-band performance;sidelobe levels;rapid beamforming algorithms;reconfigurable systems;fractal frequency-selective surfaces","","535","","121","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The NOR cell is basically a floating-gate MOS transistor, programmed by channel hot electron and erased by Fowler-Nordheim tunneling. The main reliability issues, such as charge retention and endurance, are discussed, together with an understanding of the basic physical mechanisms responsible. Most of these considerations are also valid for the NAND cell, since it is based on the same concept of floating-gate MOS transistor. Furthermore, an insight into the multilevel approach, where two bits are stored in the same cell, is presented. In fact, the exploitation of the multilevel approach at each technology node allows an increase of the memory efficiency, almost doubling the density at the same chip size, enlarging the application range and reducing the cost per bit. Finally, NOR flash cell scaling issues are covered, pointing out the main challenges. Flash cell scaling has been demonstrated to be really possible and to be able to follow Moore's law down to the 130-nm technology generations. Technology development and consolidated know-how is expected to sustain the scaling trend down to 90- and 65-nm technology nodes. One of the crucial issues to be solved to allow cell scaling below the 65-nm node is the tunnel oxide thickness reduction, as tunnel thinning is limited by intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2003.811702","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1199079","","Flash memory;Random access memory;Nonvolatile memory;Semiconductor memory;Writing;Costs;MOSFETs;CMOS technology;Power supplies;EPROM","flash memories;integrated circuit reliability;tunnelling;MOSFET;voltage distribution","NOR flash memory technology;memory cell functionality;cell architecture;floating-gate MOS transistor;channel hot electron programming;Fowler-Nordheim tunneling erasure;reliability issues;charge retention;endurance;NAND cell;multilevel approach;memory efficiency;NOR flash cell scaling issues;Moore law;technology development;tunnel oxide thickness reduction;tunnel thinning;130 to 65 nm","","442","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Several questions arise, such as what exactly the infrastructure is, what threats it must be secured against, and how protection can be provided on a cost-effective basis. But underlying all these questions is how to define a secure system. What is security? Having it is obviously good; everyone says so. But few people define it exactly, or even nebulously.

We then investigate the system performance when different diversity schemes are employed. It is shown that there is not much improvement in the probability of detection when either the probability of false alarm (P/sub f/) exceeds 0/1 or the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) exceeds 20 dB. In addition, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves comparing the performance of equal-gain combining (EGC), selection combining (SC), and switch and stay combining (SSC) are presented.

Proceedings of the","","2003","","","10 pp.","","Over the years, our group, led by Bob Baker, designed and implemented three domain-specific languages for use by outside people in real situations. The first language described the communication format of messages used by NATO to specify command-and-control messages between people and equipment; the processor we generated checked these messages for consistency. The second language was in part graphical, part textual, and was used to demonstrate how naval ship formations were constituted and the constrained movements they could undergo. The last language was a mixture of graphics, text, and declarative information specified using three different COTS products. It was used to describe census survey ""instruments,"" used to collect census data in the field. The code generated was to be installed in the survey takers' laptops. Each of these was actually a prototype for what would have taken more time to engineer and polish before putting into practice. Although each effort was essentially successful, none of the languages was ever followed up with the subsequent engineering efforts that we expected or at least hoped for. The first two were demonstrated and reviewed informally. The last effort was more seriously reviewed, in that training sessions and a formal review process were undertaken to evaluate the potential effectiveness of the product.

In brief, the transmitter decomposes the channel into two interference channels, where interference is caused by the other user signal. Users are successively encoded, such that encoding of the second user is based on the noncausal knowledge of the interference caused by the first user. The crosstalk parameters are optimized such that the overall throughput is maximum and, surprisingly, this is shown to be optimal over all possible strategies (not only with respect to Marton's achievable region). For the case of r>2 users, we find a somewhat simpler choice of Marton's region based on ordering and successively encoding the users. For each user i in the given ordering, the interference caused by users j>i is eliminated by zero forcing at the transmitter, while interference caused by users j<i is taken into account by coding for noncausally known interference. Under certain mild conditions, this scheme is found to be throughput-wise asymptotically optimal for both high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We conclude by providing some numerical results for the ergodic throughput of the simplified zero-forcing scheme in independent Rayleigh fading.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2003.813523","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1207369","","Throughput;Broadcasting;Transmitters;Interference elimination;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Interference channels;Crosstalk;Signal to noise ratio;Rayleigh channels","Gaussian channels;broadcast channels;receiving antennas;transmitting antennas;antenna arrays;channel capacity;Rayleigh channels;crosstalk;radiofrequency interference;reviews;encoding","Gaussian broadcast channel;single-antenna receivers;transmitter antennas;nondegraded broadcast channel;capacity region;Marton's region;optimal sum-rate;throughput;interference channels;encoding;crosstalk parameters;zero forcing;signal-to-noise ratio;SNR;ergodic throughput;simplified zero-forcing;independent Rayleigh fading;multiple input multiple output channel;MIMO channel","","1665","","57","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Autonomic computing, perhaps the most attractive approach to solving this problem, creates systems that can manage themselves when given high-level objectives from administrators. Systems manage themselves according to an administrator's goals. New components integrate as effortlessly as a new cell establishes itself in the human body.

The object is represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce the effects of noise in the descriptors. The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used.

We compute a lower bound on the capacity of a channel that is learned by training, and maximize the bound as a function of the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), fading coherence time, and number of transmitter antennas. When the training and data powers are allowed to vary, we show that the optimal number of training symbols is equal to the number of transmit antennas-this number is also the smallest training interval length that guarantees meaningful estimates of the channel matrix. When the training and data powers are instead required to be equal, the optimal number of symbols may be larger than the number of antennas.

Due to the dual-power-source nature of these vehicles, control strategies based on engineering intuition frequently fail to fully explore the potential of these advanced vehicles. In this paper, we present a procedure for the design of a near-optimal power management strategy. The design procedure starts by defining a cost function, such as minimizing a combination of fuel consumption and selected emission species over a driving cycle. Dynamic programming (DP) is then utilized to find the optimal control actions including the gear-shifting sequence and the power split between the engine and motor while subject to a battery SOC-sustaining constraint. Through analysis of the behavior of DP control actions, near-optimal rules are extracted, which, unlike DP control signals, are implementable. The performance of this power management control strategy is studied by using the hybrid vehicle model HE-VESIM developed at the Automotive Research Center of the University of Michigan. A tradeoff study between fuel economy and emissions was performed. It was found that significant emission reduction could be achieved at the expense of a small increase in fuel consumption.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2003.815606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1255660","","Energy management;Land vehicles;Fuel economy;Automotive engineering;Road vehicles;Vehicle driving;Power engineering and energy;Intelligent vehicles;Cost function;Dynamic programming","dynamic programming;regenerative braking;optimal control;hybrid electric vehicles;power control","power management strategy;parallel hybrid electric truck;powertrain control;hybrid vehicle techniques;fuel economy;dynamic programming;optimal control;gear-shifting sequence;near-optimal rules;hybrid vehicle model HE-VESIM","","686","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method is based on the ""N+2"" transversal network coupling matrix, which is able to accommodate multiple input/output couplings, as well as the direct source-load coupling needed for the fully canonical cases. Firstly, the direct method for building up the coupling matrix for the transversal network is described. A simple non-optimization process is then outlined for the conversion of the transversal matrix to the equivalent ""N+2"" folded-configuration coupling matrix. The folded matrix may be used directly to realize microwave bandpass filters in a variety of technologies, but some of these could require awkward-to-realize cross-couplings.

This paper focuses on the reflection phase feature of EBG surfaces: when plane waves normally illuminate an EBG structure, the phase of the reflected field changes continuously from 180/spl deg/ to -180/spl deg/ versus frequency. One important application of this feature is that one can replace a conventional perfect electric conductor (PEC) ground plane with an EBG ground plane for a low profile wire antenna design. For this design, the operational frequency band of an EBG structure is defined as the frequency region within which a low profile wire antenna radiates efficiently, namely, having a good return loss and radiation patterns. The operational frequency band is the overlap of the input-match frequency band and the surface-wave frequency bandgap. It is revealed that the reflection phase curve can be used to identify the input-match frequency band inside of which a low profile wire antenna exhibits a good return loss. The surface-wave frequency bandgap of the EBG surface that helps improve radiation patterns is very close to its input-match frequency band, resulting in an effective operational frequency band. In contrast, a thin grounded slab cannot work efficiently as a ground plane for low profile wire antennas because its surface-wave frequency bandgap and input-match frequency band do not overlap. Parametric studies have been performed to obtain design guidelines for EBG ground planes. Two novel EBG ground planes with interesting electromagnetic features are also presented. The rectangular patch EBG ground plane has a polarization dependent reflection phase and the slotted patch EBG ground plane shows a compact size.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2003.817559","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1236087","","Wire;Reflector antennas;Periodic structures;Frequency;Metamaterials;Electromagnetic reflection;Photonic band gap;Electromagnetic devices;Antenna radiation patterns;Surface waves","wire antennas;antenna accessories;electromagnetic wave reflection;photonic band gap;microwave materials","reflection phase characterizations;EBG ground plane;low profile wire antenna applications;mushroom-like electromagnetic band-gap structures;electromagnetic properties;electromagnetic device applications;plane waves;reflected field;conventional perfect electric conductor;PEC ground plane;operational frequency band;return loss;radiation patterns;input-match frequency band;surface-wave frequency bandgap","","596","","42","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"The sliding DFT","E. Jacobsen; R.

The sliding DFT provides computational advantages over the traditional DFT or FFT for many applications requiring successive output calculations, especially when only a subset of the DFT output bins are required. Methods for output stabilization as well as time-domain data windowing by means of frequency-domain convolution were also discussed. A modified sliding DFT algorithm, called the sliding Goertzel DFT, was proposed to further reduce the computational workload.

However, in many applications, one requires nonuniform sampling in the frequency domain, i.e., a nonuniform FT. Several papers have described fast approximations for the nonuniform FT based on interpolating an oversampled FFT. This paper presents an interpolation method for the nonuniform FT that is optimal in the min-max sense of minimizing the worst-case approximation error over all signals of unit norm. The proposed method easily generalizes to multidimensional signals. Numerical results show that the min-max approach provides substantially lower approximation errors than conventional interpolation methods. The min-max criterion is also useful for optimizing the parameters of interpolation kernels such as the Kaiser-Bessel function.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2002.807005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1166689","","Fast Fourier transforms;Interpolation;Frequency domain analysis;Approximation error;Iterative methods;Image reconstruction;Multidimensional signal processing;Nonuniform sampling;Multidimensional systems;Magnetic resonance imaging","fast Fourier transforms;interpolation;minimax techniques;frequency-domain analysis;multidimensional signal processing;signal sampling","nonuniform fast Fourier transforms;min-max interpolation;FFT;signal processing;nonuniform sampling;frequency domain;nonuniform FT;worst-case approximation error;multidimensional signals;Kaiser-Bessel function","","626","","65","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Combining iterative processing with multiple-antenna channels is particularly challenging because the channel capacities can be a factor of ten or more higher than their single-antenna counterparts. Using a ""list"" version of the sphere decoder, we provide a simple method to iteratively detect and decode any linear space-time mapping combined with any channel code that can be decoded using so-called ""soft"" inputs and outputs. We exemplify our technique by directly transmitting symbols that are coded with a channel code; we show that iterative processing with even this simple scheme can achieve near-capacity.

Propagation analysis provides a good initial estimate of the signal characteristics. The ability to accurately predict radio-propagation behavior for wireless personal communication systems, such as cellular mobile radio, is becoming crucial to system design. Since site measurements are costly, propagation models have been developed as a suitable, low-cost, and convenient alternative. Channel modeling is required to predict path, loss and to characterize the impulse response of the propagating channel. The path loss is associated with the design of base stations, as this tells us how much a transmitter needs to radiate to service a given region. Channel characterization, on the other hand, deals with the fidelity of the received signals, and has to do with the nature of the waveform received at a receiver. The objective here is to design a suitable receiver that will receive the transmitted signal, distorted due to the multipath and dispersion effects of the channel, and that will decode the transmitted signal. An understanding of the various propagation models can actually address both problems. This paper begins with a review of the information available on the various propagation models for both indoor and outdoor environments. The existing models can be classified into two major classes: statistical models and site-specific models. The main characteristics of the radio channel - such as path loss, fading, and time-delay spread - are discussed. Currently, a third alternative, which includes many new numerical methods, is being introduced to propagation prediction. The advantages and disadvantages of some of these methods are summarized. In addition, an impulse-response characterization for the propagation path is also presented, including models for small-scale fading, Finally, it is shown that when two-way communication ports can be defined for a mobile system, it is possible to use reciprocity to focus the energy along the direction of an intended user without any explicit knowledge of the electromagnetic environment in which the system is operating, or knowledge of the spatial locations of the transmitter and the receiver.","1558-4143","","10.1109/MAP.2003.1232163","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232163","","Mobile communication;Propagation losses;Fading;Parameter estimation;Signal analysis;Wireless communication;Land mobile radio;System analysis and design;Predictive models;Base stations","radiowave propagation;mobile radio;transient response;multipath channels;statistical analysis","propagation models;mobile communication;signal parameters;propagation characteristics;signal characteristics;cellular radio;path loss;impulse response;propagating channel;base stations;channel characterization;multipath;dispersion effects;site-specific models;statistical models;impulse-response characterization;small-scale fading;two-way communication ports;reciprocity","","463","","161","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The first is categorized under large disturbance nonlinear analysis; the second approach considers small disturbances, where the corresponding dynamic equations are linearized. Applications of a range of generator models are discussed and treated. The manner in which generator saturation is treated in stability studies, both in the initialization process as well as during large or small disturbance stability analysis procedures is addressed. Saturation functions that are derived, whether from test data or by the methods, of finite elements are developed. Different saturation algorithms for calculating values of excitation and internal power angle depending upon generator terminal conditions are compared. The question of parameter determination is covered. Two approaches in accounting for generator field and excitation system base quantities are identified.

This is the highest gain reported for a two-stage design in CMOS at the 0.8-2.4-GHz frequency range.

Instead of considering each design criterion in a separate way, we generalize the existing results by developing a unified framework based on considering two families of objective functions that embrace most reasonable criteria to design a communication system: Schur-concave and Schur-convex functions. Once the optimal structure of the transmit-receive processing is known, the design problem simplifies and can be formulated within the powerful framework of convex optimization theory, in which a great number of interesting design criteria can be easily accommodated and efficiently solved, even though closed-form expressions may not exist. From this perspective, we analyze a variety of design criteria, and in particular, we derive optimal beamvectors in the sense of having minimum average bit error rate (BER). Additional constraints on the peak-to-average ratio (PAR) or on the signal dynamic range are easily included in the design.

The estimate is achieved by fitting a statistical, morphable model of 3D faces to images. The model is learned from a set of textured 3D scans of heads. We describe the construction of the morphable model, an algorithm to fit the model to images, and a framework for face identification.

The design of EEG representations and classifiers for BCI are open research questions whose difficulty stems from the need to extract complex spatial and temporal patterns from noisy multidimensional time series obtained from EEG measurements. The high-dimensional and noisy nature of EEG may limit the advantage of nonlinear classification methods over linear ones. This paper reports the results of a linear (linear discriminant analysis) and two nonlinear classifiers (neural networks and support vector machines) applied to the classification of spontaneous EEG during five mental tasks, showing that nonlinear classifiers produce only slightly better classification results.

Even in single-target problems, this optimal filter is so computationally challenging that it must usually be approximated. Consequently, multitarget Bayes filtering will never be of practical interest without the development of drastic but principled approximation strategies. In single-target problems, the computationally fastest approximate filtering approach is the constant-gain Kalman filter. This filter propagates a first-order statistical moment - the posterior expectation - in the place of the posterior distribution. The purpose of this paper is to propose an analogous strategy for multitarget systems: propagation of a first-order statistical moment of the multitarget posterior. This moment, the probability hypothesis density (PHD), is the function whose integral in any region of state space is the expected number of targets in that region. We derive recursive Bayes filter equations for the PHD that account for multiple sensors, nonconstant probability of detection, Poisson false alarms, and appearance, spawning, and disappearance of targets. We also show that the PHD is a best-fit approximation of the multitarget posterior in an information-theoretic sense.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2003.1261119","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1261119","","Filtering;Sensor systems;State-space methods;Virtual colonoscopy;Probability;Density measurement;Random number generation;Nonlinear filters;Terrorism;Contracts","filtering theory;target tracking;recursive filters;Kalman filters;Bayes methods","multitarget Bayes filtering;first-order multitarget moment;multisensor-multitarget detection;tracking;identification;recursive Bayes nonlinear filter;constant-gain Kalman filter;first-order statistical moment;posterior expectation;probability hypothesis density;PHD;multitarget posterior","","1104","","70","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most popular are methods that assign each approximation set a vector of real numbers that reflect different aspects of the quality. Sometimes, pairs of approximation sets are also considered.

Using parameters of the mechanical system, the piezoelectric element, and the converter; the ""optimal"" duty cycle can be determined where the harvested power is maximized for the level of mechanical excitation. It is shown that, as the magnitude of the mechanical excitation increases, the optimal duty cycle becomes essentially constant, greatly simplifying the control of the step-down converter.

The latter modulates the local variance of the coefficients in the neighborhood, and is thus able to account for the empirically observed correlation between the coefficient amplitudes. Under this model, the Bayesian least squares estimate of each coefficient reduces to a weighted average of the local linear estimates over all possible values of the hidden multiplier variable.

All the fluidic movement is confined between two plates, which we call parallel-plate channel, rather than through closed channels or on open surfaces. While transporting and merging droplets are easily verified, we discover that there exists a design criterion for a given set of materials beyond which the droplet simply cannot be cut by EWOD mechanism.

In particular, if the desired signal is present in training snapshots, the adaptive array performance may be quite sensitive even to slight mismatches between the presumed and actual signal steering vectors (spatial signatures). Such mismatches can occur as a result of environmental nonstationarities, look direction errors, imperfect array calibration, distorted antenna shape, as well as distortions caused by medium inhomogeneities, near-far mismatch, source spreading, and local scattering. The similar type of performance degradation can occur when the signal steering vector is known exactly but the training sample size is small. In this paper, we develop a new approach to robust adaptive beamforming in the presence of an arbitrary unknown signal steering vector mismatch. Our approach is based on the optimization of worst-case performance. It turns out that the natural formulation of this adaptive beamforming problem involves minimization of a quadratic function subject to infinitely many nonconvex quadratic constraints. We show that this (originally intractable) problem can be reformulated in a convex form as the so-called second-order cone (SOC) program and solved efficiently (in polynomial time) using the well-established interior point method. It is also shown that the proposed technique can be interpreted in terms of diagonal loading where the optimal value of the diagonal loading factor is computed based on the known level of uncertainty of the signal steering vector. Computer simulations with several frequently encountered types of signal steering vector mismatches show better performance of our robust beamformer as compared with existing adaptive beamforming algorithms.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2002.806865","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1166614","","Robustness;Array signal processing;Optimization;Sensor arrays;Degradation;Adaptive arrays;Antenna arrays;Calibration;Directive antennas;Shape","array signal processing;optimisation","robust adaptive beamforming;worst-case performance optimization;signal mismatch problem;training snapshots;signal steering vectors;spatial signatures;environmental nonstationarities;look direction errors;imperfect array calibration;distorted antenna shape;medium inhomogeneities;near-far mismatch;source spreading;local scattering;performance degradation;quadratic function;nonconvex quadratic constraints;second-order cone program;SOC program;interior point method;diagonal loading","","901","","39","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

MICRO-36.","","2003","","","7","18","With increasing clock frequencies and silicon integration, power aware computing has become a critical concern in the design of embedded processors and systems-on-chip. One of the more effective and widely used methods for power-aware computing is dynamic voltage scaling (DVS). In order to obtain the maximum power savings from DVS, it is essential to scale the supply voltage as low as possible while ensuring correct operation of the processor. The critical voltage is chosen such that under a worst-case scenario of process and environmental variations, the processor always operates correctly. However, this approach leads to a very conservative supply voltage since such a worst-case combination of different variabilities is very rare. In this paper, we propose a new approach to DVS, called Razor, based on dynamic detection and correction of circuit timing errors. The key idea of Razor is to tune the supply voltage by monitoring the error rate during circuit operation, thereby eliminating the need for voltage margins and exploiting the data dependence of circuit delay. A Razor flip-flop is introduced that double-samples pipeline stage values, once with a fast clock and again with a time-borrowing delayed clock. A metastability-tolerant comparator then validates latch values sampled with the fast clock. In the event of timing error, a modified pipeline mispeculation recovery mechanism restores correct program state. A prototype Razor pipeline was designed in a 0.18 /spl mu/m technology and was analyzed. Razor energy overhead during normal operation is limited to 3.1%. Analyses of a full-custom multiplier and a SPICE-level Kogge-Stone adder model reveal that substantial energy savings are possible for these devices (up to 64.2%) with little impact on performance due to error recovery (less than 3%).","","0-7695-2043-X","10.1109/MICRO.2003.1253179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253179","","Pipelines;Timing;Clocks;Dynamic voltage scaling;Voltage control;Error correction;Tuned circuits;Delay;Frequency;Silicon","system-on-chip;pipeline processing;flip-flops;logic design;comparators (circuits);timing circuits;low-power electronics","Razor;low-power pipeline;circuit-level timing speculation;clock frequencies;silicon integration;power aware computing;embedded processors;systems-on-chip design;dynamic voltage scaling;maximum power savings;supply voltage;critical voltage;process variations;environmental variations;dynamic detection;dymanic correction;circuit timing errors;error rate monitoring;voltage margins;data dependence;circuit delay;double-samples pipeline stage;time-borrowing delayed clock;metastability-tolerant comparator;pipeline mispeculation recovery mechanism;program state;full-custom multiplier;SPICE-level Kogge-Stone adder model;error recovery;0.18 microns","","684","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, optimal performance requires either complete channel knowledge or knowledge of the optimal beamforming vector; both are hard to realize. In this article, a quantized maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) beamforming technique is proposed where the receiver only sends the label of the best beamforming vector in a predetermined codebook to the transmitter. By using the distribution of the optimal beamforming vector in independent and identically distributed Rayleigh fading matrix channels, the codebook design problem is solved and related to the problem of Grassmannian line packing. The proposed design criterion is flexible enough to allow for side constraints on the codebook vectors. Bounds on the codebook size are derived to guarantee full diversity order. Results on the density of Grassmannian line packings are derived and used to develop bounds on the codebook size given a capacity or SNR loss. Monte Carlo simulations are presented that compare the probability of error for different quantization strategies.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2003.817466","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1237152","","Array signal processing;MIMO;Diversity reception;Rayleigh channels;Transmitters;Feedback;Channel state information;Signal to noise ratio;Quantization;Resilience","array signal processing;MIMO systems;diversity reception;error statistics;Rayleigh channels;matrix algebra;codes;Monte Carlo methods;digital simulation","Grassmannian beamforming;multiple-input multiple-output wireless systems;MIMO wireless systems;transmit beamforming;receive combining;optimal performance;optimal beamforming vector;channel knowledge;quantized maximum signal-to-noise ratio;quantized maximum SNR beamforming;codebook;independent identically distributed fading channels;Rayleigh fading matrix channels;codebook design;Grassmannian line packing;codebook size bounds;SNR loss;Monte Carlo simulations;error probability","","1079","","49","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the existing wireless channel models, i.e., physical-layer channel models, do not explicitly characterize a wireless channel in terms of these QoS metrics. In this paper, we propose and develop a link-layer channel model termed effective capacity (EC). In this approach, we first model a wireless link by two EC functions, namely, the probability of nonempty buffer, and the QoS exponent of a connection. Then, we propose a simple and efficient algorithm to estimate these EC functions. The physical-layer analogs of these two link-layer EC functions are the marginal distribution (e.g., Rayleigh-Ricean distribution) and the Doppler spectrum, respectively. The key advantages of the EC link-layer modeling and estimation are: 1) ease of translation into QoS guarantees, such as delay bounds; 2) simplicity of implementation; and 3) accuracy, and hence, efficiency in admission control and resource reservation. We illustrate the advantage of our approach with a set of simulation experiments, which show that the actual QoS metric is closely approximated by the QoS metric predicted by the EC link-layer model, under a wide range of conditions.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2003.814353","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1210731","","Quality of service;Delay estimation;Wireless networks;Admission control;Next generation networking;Predictive models;Communication system traffic control;Traffic control;Fading;Queueing analysis","channel capacity;quality of service;delays;Rayleigh channels;Rician channels;queueing theory","effective capacity;wireless link model;quality of service;next-generation wireless networks;wireless channel;connection-level QoS metrics;data rate;delay;delay-violation probability;link-layer channel model;nonempty buffer;marginal distribution;Rayleigh-Ricean distribution;Doppler spectrum;delay bounds;admission control;resource reservation","","521","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown in this paper that, by exploiting the processing power inherent in current computing systems, substantial gains in classifier accuracy and response time are possible. Other important characteristics for prosthetic control systems are met as well. Due to the fact that the classifier learns the muscle activation patterns for each desired class for each individual, a natural control actuation results.

It is shown that the optimal pilot sequences are equipowered, equispaced, and phase shift orthogonal. To reduce the training overhead, an LS channel estimation scheme over multiple OFDM symbols is also discussed. Moreover, to enhance channel estimation, a recursive LS (RLS) algorithm is proposed, for which we derive the optimal forgetting or tracking factor. This factor is found to be a function of both the noise variance and the channel Doppler spread. Through simulations, it is shown that the optimal pilot sequences derived in this paper outperform both the orthogonal and random pilot sequences.

The other source of power dissipation in today's microprocessors, dynamic power, arises from the repeated capacitance charge and discharge on the output of the hundreds of millions of gates in today's chips. Until recently, only dynamic power has been a significant source of power consumption, and Moore's law helped control it. However, power consumption has now become a primary microprocessor design constraint; one that researchers in both industry and academia will struggle to overcome in the next few years. Microprocessor design has traditionally focused on dynamic power consumption as a limiting factor in system integration.

The compensation scheme uses the positive phase shift of left-half-plane (LHP) zeroes caused by the feedforward path to cancel the negative phase shift of poles to achieve a good phase margin. A two-stage path increases further the low frequency gain while a feedforward single-stage amplifier makes the circuit faster. The amplifier bandwidth is not compromised by the absence of the traditional pole-splitting effect of Miller compensation, resulting in a high-gain wideband amplifier. The capacitors of a capacitive amplifier using the proposed techniques can be varied more than a decade without significant settling time degradation. Experimental results for a prototype fabricated in an AMI 0.5-μm CMOS process show DC gain of around 90 dB and a 1% settling time of 15 ns for a load capacitor of 12 pF.

The data collected by each sensor is communicated through the network to a single processing center that uses all reported data to determine characteristics of the environment or detect an event. The communication or message passing process must be designed to conserve the limited energy resources of the sensors. Clustering sensors into groups, so that sensors communicate information only to clusterheads and then the clusterheads communicate the aggregated information to the processing center, may save energy. In this paper, we propose a distributed, randomized clustering algorithm to organize the sensors in a wireless sensor network into clusters. We then extend this algorithm to generate a hierarchy of clusterheads and observe that the energy savings increase with the number of levels in the hierarchy. Results in stochastic geometry are used to derive solutions for the values of parameters of our algorithm that minimize the total energy spent in the network when all sensors report data through the clusterheads to the processing center.","0743-166X","0-7803-7752-4","10.1109/INFCOM.2003.1209194","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1209194","","Energy efficiency;Clustering algorithms;Wireless sensor networks;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Transceivers;Event detection;Message passing;Process design;Energy resources;Stochastic processes","distributed algorithms;wireless sensor networks;randomised algorithms;transceivers;message passing;stochastic processes;computational geometry","energy efficient hierarchical clustering algorithm;wireless sensor network;low-power transceiver;environment characteristics determination;event detection;message passing process;sensor energy resource;distributed algorithm;randomized algorithm;stochastic geometry;information processing center;Voronoi tessellations","","680","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, a source initiates transmission to its destination, and many relays potentially receive the transmission. Those terminals that can fully decode the transmission utilize a space-time code to cooperatively relay to the destination. We demonstrate that these protocols achieve full spatial diversity in the number of cooperating terminals, not just the number of decoding relays, and can be used effectively for higher spectral efficiencies than repetition-based schemes. We discuss issues related to space-time code design for these protocols, emphasizing codes that readily allow for appealing distributed versions.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2003.817829","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1237130","","Wireless application protocol;Intelligent networks;Wireless networks;Diversity reception;Relays;Signal processing algorithms;Fading;Decoding;Bandwidth;Antenna arrays","space-time codes;protocols;multipath channels;fading channels;diversity reception;decoding","distributed space-time-coded protocols;cooperative diversity;wireless networks;cooperative diversity protocols;multipath fading;spatial diversity;distributed terminals;destination terminal;decoding relays;spectral efficiencies;repetition-based schemes","","3108","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This task of estimating camera motion from measurements of a continuously expanding set of self-mapped visual features is one of a class of problems known as Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) in the robotics community, and we argue that such real-time mapping research, despite rarely being camera-based, is more relevant here than off-line structure from motion methods due to the more fundamental emphasis placed on propagation of uncertainty. We present a top-down Bayesian framework for single-camera localisation via mapping of a sparse set of natural features using motion modelling and an information-guided active measurement strategy, in particular addressing the difficult issue of real-time feature initialisation via a factored sampling approach. Real-time handling of uncertainty permits robust localisation via the creating and active measurement of a sparse map of landmarks such that regions can be re-visited after periods of neglect and localisation can continue through periods when few features are visible. Results are presented of real-time localisation for a hand-waved camera with very sparse prior scene knowledge and all processing carried out on a desktop PC.","","0-7695-1950-4","10.1109/ICCV.2003.1238654","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1238654","","Simultaneous localization and mapping;Cameras;Motion estimation;Layout;Motion measurement;Robot vision systems;Bayesian methods;Particle measurements;Sampling methods;Robustness","computer vision;motion estimation;real-time systems;feature extraction;video cameras;Bayes methods","single camera;ego-motion estimation;real-time performance;off-line processing;camera motion;self-mapped visual features;simultaneous localisation and mapping;SLAM;robotics;real-time mapping research;uncertainty propagation;Bayesian framework;single-camera localisation;natural features;motion modelling;active measurement strategy;factored sampling approach;robust localisation;real-time localisation;hand-waved camera;scene knowledge;desktop PC;real-time processing;computer vision","","847","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"The node distribution of the random waypoint mobility model for wireless ad hoc networks","C. Bettstetter; G. Resta; P. Santi","Inst. of Commun. Networks, Technische Univ.

Munchen, Munich, Germany","IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","","2003","2","3","257","269","The random waypoint model is a commonly used mobility model in the simulation of ad hoc networks. It is known that the spatial distribution of network nodes moving according to this model is, in general, nonuniform. However, a closed-form expression of this distribution and an in-depth investigation is still missing. This fact impairs the accuracy of the current simulation methodology of ad hoc networks and makes it impossible to relate simulation-based performance results to corresponding analytical results. To overcome these problems, we present a detailed analytical study of the spatial node distribution generated by random waypoint mobility. More specifically, we consider a generalization of the model in which the pause time of the mobile nodes is chosen arbitrarily in each waypoint and a fraction of nodes may remain static for the entire simulation time. We show that the structure of the resulting distribution is the weighted sum of three independent components: the static, pause, and mobility component. This division enables us to understand how the model's parameters influence the distribution. We derive an exact equation of the asymptotically stationary distribution for movement on a line segment and an accurate approximation for a square area. The good quality of this approximation is validated through simulations using various settings of the mobility parameters. In summary, this article gives a fundamental understanding of the behavior of the random waypoint model.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2003.1233531","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1233531","","Ad hoc networks;Analytical models;Stochastic processes;Mobile ad hoc networks;Closed-form solution;Performance analysis;Equations;Mobile computing;Computational modeling;Computer simulation","mobile computing;ad hoc networks;mobile radio;simulation","random waypoint mobility model;wireless ad hoc networks;performance;spatial node distribution;pause time;simulation;weighted sum;static component;pause component;mobility component;mobile ad hoc networking;asymptotically stationary distribution;line segment;square area;approximation","","659","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most scan match algorithms require finding correspondences between the used features, i.e. points or lines. We propose an alternative representation for a range scan, the normal distributions transform. Similar to an occupancy grid, we subdivide the 2D plane into cells. To each cell, we assign a normal distribution, which locally models the probability of measuring a point. The result of the transform is a piecewise continuous and differentiable probability density, that can be used to match another scan using Newton's algorithm. Thereby, no explicit correspondences have to be established. We present the algorithm in detail and show the application to relative position tracking and simultaneous localization and map building (SLAM).

DC power systems have been discussed as a result of the introduction of renewable, small-scale power generation units. Also, telecommunication power systems featuring UPS properties might benefit from a broader introduction of DC power systems. Droop control is utilized to distribute the load between the source converters. In order to make the loading of the source converters equal, in per unit, the voltage control algorithm for each converter has to be designed to act similar. The DC side capacitor of each converter, needed for filtering, is also determined as a consequence. The root locus is investigated for varying DC bus impedance. It is found that the risk of entering converter over-modulation is a stronger limitation than stability, at least for reasonable DC bus cable parameters.

By incorporating varactor diodes into the texture, we have built a tunable impedance surface, in which an applied bias voltage controls the resonance frequency, and the reflection phase. We can program the surface to create a tunable phase gradient, which can electronically steer a reflected beam over +/- 40/spl deg/ in two dimensions, for both polarizations.

For each image sequence, a background subtraction algorithm and a simple correspondence procedure are first used to segment and track the moving silhouettes of a walking figure. Then, eigenspace transformation based on principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to time-varying distance signals derived from a sequence of silhouette images to reduce the dimensionality of the input feature space. Supervised pattern classification techniques are finally performed in the lower-dimensional eigenspace for recognition.

The current collapse was eliminated by the passivation of the device surface with Si/sub 3/N/sub 4/ film.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2003.816549","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232918","","Aluminum compounds;Gallium compounds;MODFETs;Surfaces;Passivation","aluminium compounds;gallium compounds;III-V semiconductors;high electron mobility transistors;surface states;passivation;wide band gap semiconductors","current collapse;AlGaN/GaN HEMT;bias stress;light illumination;surface states;surface passivation;Si/sub 3/N/sub 4/ film;series resistance;AlGaN-GaN;Si/sub 3/N/sub 4/","","141","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the SMPM motor, due to the flux of the permanent magnet, the stator core around the q-axis winding is saturated. This makes the magnetic saliency in the motor. This magnetic saliency has the information about the rotor position. The high-frequency voltage signal is injected into the motor in order to detect the magnetic saliency and estimate the rotor position. In this paper, the relationship between the high-frequency voltages and high-frequency currents is developed using the voltage equations at the high frequency, and the high-frequency impedance characteristics are analyzed experimentally under various conditions. The proposed sensorless control scheme makes it possible to drive the SMPM motor in the low-speed region including zero speed, even under heavy load conditions. The experimental results verify the performance of the proposed sensorless algorithm.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2003.813734","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1215434","","Permanent magnet motors;Magnetic flux;Saturation magnetization;Voltage;Sensorless control;Rotors;Surface impedance;Stator cores;Stator windings;Equations","permanent magnet motors;machine control;electric impedance;stators;rotors;synchronous motor drives","sensorless drive;surface-mounted permanent-magnet motor;high-frequency signal injection;magnetic saliency;high-frequency impedance difference;permanent magnet flux;stator core;q-axis winding;rotor position;high-frequency voltage signal;high-frequency currents;high-frequency voltages;voltage equations;high-frequency impedance;sensorless control scheme;heavy load conditions","","299","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Eng., Tel-Aviv Univ., Israel; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","","2003","11","4","450","461","A novel framework for logical reasoning, termed complex fuzzy logic, is presented in this paper. Complex fuzzy logic is a generalization of traditional fuzzy logic, based on complex fuzzy sets. In complex fuzzy logic, inference rules are constructed and ""fired"" in a manner that closely parallels traditional fuzzy logic. The novelty of complex fuzzy logic is that the sets used in the reasoning process are complex fuzzy sets, characterized by complex-valued membership functions. The range of these membership functions is extended from the traditional fuzzy range of [0,1] to the unit circle in the complex plane, thus providing a method for describing membership in a set in terms of a complex number. Several mathematical properties of complex fuzzy sets, which serve as a basis for the derivation of complex fuzzy logic, are reviewed in this paper. These properties include basic set theoretic operations on complex fuzzy sets - namely complex fuzzy union and intersection, complex fuzzy relations and their composition, and a novel form of set aggregation - vector aggregation. Complex fuzzy logic is designed to maintain the advantages of traditional fuzzy logic, while benefiting from the properties of complex numbers and complex fuzzy sets. The introduction of complex-valued grades of membership to the realm of fuzzy logic generates a framework with unique mathematical properties, and considerable potential for further research and application.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2003.814832","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1220291","","Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy set theory;Mathematical model;Humans;Decision making;Fuzzy control;Hybrid intelligent systems;Set theory","fuzzy logic","fuzzy logic;logical reasoning;complex fuzzy logic;complex fuzzy relations;grades of membership;aggregation","","135","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper deals with the application of SVM in financial time series forecasting. The feasibility of applying SVM in financial forecasting is first examined by comparing it with the multilayer back-propagation (BP) neural network and the regularized radial basis function (RBF) neural network. The variability in performance of SVM with respect to the free parameters is investigated experimentally. Adaptive parameters are then proposed by incorporating the nonstationarity of financial time series into SVM. Five real futures contracts collated from the Chicago Mercantile Market are used as the data sets. The simulation shows that among the three methods, SVM outperforms the BP neural network in financial forecasting, and there are comparable generalization performance between SVM and the regularized RBF neural network. Furthermore, the free parameters of SVM have a great effect on the generalization performance. SVM with adaptive parameters can both achieve higher generalization performance and use fewer support vectors than the standard SVM in financial forecasting.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2003.820556","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1257413","","Support vector machines;Neural networks;Machine learning;Multi-layer neural network;Pattern recognition;Risk management;Contracts;Predictive models;Economic forecasting;Mechanical engineering","support vector machines;forecasting theory;generalisation (artificial intelligence);adaptive estimation;time series;backpropagation;radial basis function networks;stock markets;economic forecasting","support vector machine;adaptive parameters;financial time series forecasting;pattern recognition;regression estimation;multilayer backpropagation neural network;radial basis function neural network;Chicago Mercantile Market","","505","","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These are: selection diversity, maximal-ratio diversity, and equal-gain diversity systems. Quantitative measures of the relative performance (under realistic conditions) of the three systems are provided. The effects of various departures from ideal conditions, such as non-Rayleigh fading and partially coherent signal or noise voltages, are considered. Some discussion is also included of the relative merits of predetection and postdetection combining and of the problems in determining and using long-term distributions. The principal results are given in graphs and tables, useful in system design. It is seen that the simplest possible combiner, the equal-gain system, will generally yield performance essentially equivalent to the maximum obtainable from any quasilinear system.

In this paper, a new mathematical model for IPMSMs is proposed and an extended EMF is defined, which includes both position information from the EMF and the stator inductance.

We generally formulate the data rate maximization problem by allowing that a subcarrier could be shared by multiple users. The transmit power adaptation scheme is derived by solving the maximization problem via two steps: subcarrier assignment for users and power allocation for subcarriers. We have found that the data rate of a multiuser OFDM system is maximized when each subcarrier is assigned to only one user with the best channel gain for that subcarrier and the transmit power is distributed over the subcarriers by the water-filling policy. In order to reduce the computational complexity in calculating water-filling level in the proposed transmit power adaptation method, we also propose a simple method where users with the best channel gain for each subcarrier are selected and then the transmit power is equally distributed among the subcarriers. Results show that the total data rate for the proposed transmit power adaptation methods significantly increases with the number of users owing to the multiuser diversity effects and is greater than that for the conventional frequency-division multiple access (FDMA)-like transmit power adaptation schemes. Furthermore, we have found that the total data rate of the multiuser OFDM system with the proposed transmit power adaptation methods becomes even higher than the capacity of the AWGN channel when the number of users is large enough.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2002.807348","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1177182","","OFDM;Frequency domain analysis;Intersymbol interference;Downlink;Data communication;Delay;Fading;Computational complexity;Frequency diversity;AWGN channels","OFDM modulation;power control;telecommunication control;multi-access systems;optimisation;computational complexity;channel capacity;radio networks;multimedia communication","transmit power adaptation;multiuser OFDM systems;total data rate;multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;downlink transmission;data rate maximization problem;subcarrier;maximization problem;subcarrier assignment;power allocation;water-filling policy;computational complexity;transmit power;multiuser diversity;channel capacity;power control","","956","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, whenever the knowledge of the SOI steering vector is imprecise (as is often the case in practice), the performance of the Capon beamformer may become worse than that of the standard beamformer. Diagonal loading (including its extended versions) has been a popular approach to improve the robustness of the Capon beamformer. We show that a natural extension of the Capon beamformer to the case of uncertain steering vectors also belongs to the class of diagonal loading approaches, but the amount of diagonal loading can be precisely calculated based on the uncertainty set of the steering vector. The proposed robust Capon beamformer can be efficiently computed at a comparable cost with that of the standard Capon beamformer. Its excellent performance for SOI power estimation is demonstrated via a number of numerical examples.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2003.812831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1206680","","Robustness;Array signal processing;Vectors;Interference constraints;Uncertainty;Adaptive arrays;Signal resolution;Costs;Radar applications;Radar imaging","array signal processing;interference suppression;signal resolution;parameter estimation","robust Capon beamforming;diagonal loading;signal resolution;interference rejection;data-independent beamformer;array steering vector;signal of interest;SOI steering vector;uncertain steering vectors;uncertainty set;standard Capon beamformer;SOI power estimation;adaptive arrays","","732","","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The wavelet transform, in conjunction with a simple kinematics model, was used to detect different postural transitions (PTs) and walking periods during daily physical activity. To evaluate the system, three studies were performed. The method was first tested on 11 community-dwelling elderly subjects in a gait laboratory where an optical motion system (Vicon) was used as a reference system. In the second study, the system was tested for classifying PTs (i.e., lying-to-sitting, sitting-to-lying, and turning the body in bed) in 24 hospitalized elderly persons. Finally, in a third study monitoring was performed on nine elderly persons for 45-60 min during their daily physical activity. Moreover, the possibility-to-perform long-term monitoring over 12 h has been shown. The first study revealed a close concordance between the ambulatory and reference systems. Overall, subjects performed 349 PTs during this study. Compared with the reference system, the ambulatory system had an overall sensitivity of 99% for detection of the different PTs. Sensitivities and specificities were 93% and 82% in sit-to-stand, and 82% and 94% in stand-to-sit, respectively. In both first and second studies, the ambulatory system also showed a very high accuracy (> 99%) in identifying the 62 transfers or rolling out of bed, as well as 144 different posture changes to the back, ventral, right and left sides. Relatively high sensitivity (> 90%) was obtained for the classification of usual physical activities in the third study in comparison with visual observation. Sensitivities and specificities were, respectively, 90.2% and 93.4% in sitting, 92.2% and 92.1% in ""standing + walking,"" and, finally, 98.4% and 99.7% in lying. Overall detection errors (as percent of range) were 3.9% for ""standing + walking,"" 4.1% for sitting, and 0.3% for lying.

Linearity over the field of real numbers facilitates the design of ML decoders using number-theoretic tools for searching the closest lattice point. These decoders are collectively referred to as sphere decoders in the literature. In this paper, a fresh look at this class of decoding algorithms is taken. In particular, two novel algorithms are developed. The first algorithm is inspired by the Pohst enumeration strategy and is shown to offer a significant reduction in complexity compared to the Viterbo-Boutros sphere decoder. The connection between the proposed algorithm and the stack sequential decoding algorithm is then established. This connection is utilized to construct the second algorithm which can also be viewed as an application of the Schnorr-Euchner strategy to ML decoding. Aided with a detailed study of preprocessing algorithms, a variant of the second algorithm is developed and shown to offer significant reductions in the computational complexity compared to all previously proposed sphere decoders with a near-ML detection performance. This claim is supported by intuitive arguments and simulation results in many relevant scenarios.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2003.817444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1237128","","Maximum likelihood detection;Lattices;Maximum likelihood decoding;MIMO;Linearity;Detectors;Amplitude modulation;Computational complexity;Computational modeling;Feedback","computational complexity;maximum likelihood decoding;maximum likelihood detection;search problems;MIMO systems;Gaussian channels","maximum-likelihood detection;closest lattice point;maximum-likelihood decoding;ML decoding;Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output linear channels;MIMO;ML decoders;number-theoretic tools;sphere decoders;Pohst enumeration strategy;complexity;Viterbo-Boutros sphere decoder;stack sequential decoding algorithm;Schnorr-Euchner strategy;preprocessing algorithms;computational complexity","","874","","42","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To treat these phenomena, this paper presents a model based on the previously developed memory polynomial model. The contribution made in this paper is to augment the memory polynomial model to include a sparse delay tap structure that reduces the parameter space required for accurate model identification. A figure-of-merit, called the memory effect ratio, is defined to quantify the relative level of distortion due to memory effects, as compared to the memoryless portion. Another figure-of-merit is defined as the memory effect modeling ratio, which quantifies the degree to which the PA memory effects have been accounted for in the model. This new technique is validated using a variety of RF PAs, including an 880-MHz and a 2.1-GHz high-power laterally diffused metal-oxide semiconductor PA and various signals such as two-tone, eight-tone, and IS-95B signals.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2003.820155","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1256782","","Radio frequency;Power amplifiers;Radiofrequency amplifiers;History;Polynomials;Power system modeling;Signal analysis;Nonlinear distortion;RF signals;Delay","power amplifiers;radiofrequency amplifiers","nonlinear RF power amplifiers;memory effects;treat memory effects;nonlinear power amplifiers;memory polynomial model;sparse delay tap structure;memory effect ratio;metal-oxide semiconductor;2.1 GHz;880 MHz","","228","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This enables diffusion to achieve energy savings by selecting empirically good paths and by caching and processing data in-network (e.g., data aggregation). We explore and evaluate the use of directed diffusion for a simple remote-surveillance sensor network analytically and experimentally.

With an active-feedback mechanism, a high-speed block separates the low-frequency high-gain path and high-frequency signal path such that high gain and wide bandwidth can be achieved simultaneously in the AFFC amplifier. The gain stage in the active-feedback network also reduces the size of the compensation capacitors such that the overall chip area of the amplifier becomes smaller and the slew rate is improved. Furthermore, the presence of a left-half-plane zero in the proposed AFFC topology improves the stability and settling behavior of the amplifier. Three-stage amplifiers based on AFFC and nested-Miller compensation (NMC) techniques have been implemented by a commercial 0.8-μm CMOS process. When driving a 120-pF capacitive load, the AFFC amplifier achieves over 100-dB dc gain, 4.5-MHz gain-bandwidth product (GBW) , 65° phase margin, and 1.5-V/μs average slew rate, while only dissipating 400-μW power at a 2-V supply.

A bandstop filter is introduced that uses a ring resonator with direct-connected orthogonal feed lines. A new bandpass filter based on the bandstop filter uses two tuning stubs to construct a wide-band passband with two sharp stopbands. Without coupling gaps between feed lines and rings, there are no mismatch and radiation losses between them and, therefore, the new filters show low insertion loss. In addition, a dual-mode characteristic is used to increase the stopband bandwidth of the new filters. A simple transmission-line model used to calculate the frequency responses of the filters shows good agreement with measurements. The filter using three cascaded rings has 3-dB fractional bandwidth of 49.3%, an insertion loss of better than 1.6 dB in the passband, a return loss of larger than 13 dB from 4.58 to 7.3 GHz, and two rejections of greater than 40 dB within 2.75-4.02 and 7.73-9.08 GHz.

Both time domain training and frequency domain (FD) training are investigated. For FD training, maintaining a low peak-to-average power ratio of the training symbol was taken into consideration. The channel estimation scheme based on the designed training symbol was also incorporated in the system in order to give both fine-timing and frequency-offset estimates. For fine frequency estimation, two approaches are presented. The first one is based on the suppression of the interference introduced in the frequency estimation process by the training symbol pattern in the context of multipath dispersive channels. The second one is based on the maximum likelihood principle and does not suffer from any interference. A new performance measure is introduced for timing estimation, which is based on the plot of signal to timing-error-induced average interference power ratio against the timing estimate shift.

We present an improved minima controlled recursive averaging (IMCRA) approach, for noise estimation in adverse environments involving nonstationary noise, weak speech components, and low input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The noise estimate is obtained by averaging past spectral power values, using a time-varying frequency-dependent smoothing parameter that is adjusted by the signal presence probability. The speech presence probability is controlled by the minima values of a smoothed periodogram. The proposed procedure comprises two iterations of smoothing and minimum tracking. The first iteration provides a rough voice activity detection in each frequency band. Then, smoothing in the second iteration excludes relatively strong speech components, which makes the minimum tracking during speech activity robust. We show that in nonstationary noise environments and under low SNR conditions, the IMCRA approach is very effective. In particular, compared to a competitive method, it obtains a lower estimation error, and when integrated into a speech enhancement system achieves improved speech quality and lower residual noise.","1558-2353","","10.1109/TSA.2003.811544","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1223596","","Working environment noise;Spectral analysis;Signal to noise ratio;Speech enhancement;Smoothing methods;Frequency estimation;Speech recognition;Recursive estimation;Noise robustness;Estimation error","spectral analysis;parameter estimation;speech enhancement;acoustic noise;speech intelligibility;white noise;Gaussian noise;speech recognition;smoothing methods;probability","noise spectrum estimation;adverse environments;improved minima controlled recursive averaging;speech recognition system;speech enhancement system;white Gaussian noise;car noise;cockpit noise;nonstationary noise;weak speech components;low input signal-to-noise ratio;low SNR conditions;spectral power values averaging;time-varying frequency-dependent smoothing parameter;signal presence probability;speech presence probability;smoothed periodogram;minimum tracking;voice activity detection;frequency band;nonstationary noise environments;IMCRA;estimation error;speech quality","","532","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A multichannel digital receiver simultaneously down-converts a set of frequency-division-multiplexed (FDM) channels residing in a single sampled data signal stream. In a similar way, a multichannel digital transmitter simultaneously up-converts a number of baseband signals to assemble a set of FDM channels in a single sampled data signal stream. The polyphase filter bank has become the architecture of choice to efficiently accomplish these tasks. This architecture uses three interacting processes to assemble or to disassemble the channelized signal set. In a receiver, these processes are an input commutator to effect spectral folding or aliasing due to a reduction in sample rate, a polyphase M-path filter to time align the partitioned and resampled time series in each path, and a discrete Fourier transform to phase align and separate the multiple baseband aliases.

In this paper, a feedforward MP-point tracking scheme is developed for the coupled-inductor interleaved-boost-converter-fed PV system using a fuzzy controller. The proposed converter has lower switch current stress and improved efficiency over the noncoupled converter system. For a given solar insolation, the tracking algorithm changes the duty ratio of the converter such that the solar cell array voltage equals the voltage corresponding to the MP point. This is done by the feedforward loop, which generates an error signal by comparing the instantaneous array voltage and reference voltage corresponding to the MP point. Depending on the error and change of error signals, the fuzzy controller generates a control signal for the pulsewidth-modulation generator which in turn adjusts the duty ratio of the converter. The reference voltage corresponding to the MP point for the feedforward loop is obtained by an offline trained neural network. Experimental data are used for offline training of the neural network, which employs a backpropagation algorithm. The proposed peak power tracking effectiveness is demonstrated through simulation and experimental results. Tracking performance of the proposed controller is also compared with the conventional proportional-plus-integral-controller-based system. These studies reveal that the fuzzy controller results in better tracking performance.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2003.814762","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1215479","","Fuzzy control;Fuzzy systems;Control systems;Voltage;Solar power generation;Signal generators;Switching converters;Switches;Error correction;Pulse generation","photovoltaic power systems;power system control;power control;fuzzy control;inductors;three-term control;backpropagation;PWM power convertors;neurocontrollers;solar cell arrays","neural-network-based maximum-power-point tracking;fuzzy controller;coupled-inductor interleaved-boost-converter;PV system;nonlinear V-I characteristic;solar insolation;feedforward MP-point tracking scheme;switch current stress;efficiency improvement;error signals;pulsewidth-modulation generator;offline trained neural network;backpropagation algorithm;solar cell array voltage;peak power tracking effectiveness;proportional-plus-integral-controller-based system","","310","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moving shadow detection is critical for accurate object detection in video streams since shadow points are often misclassified as object points, causing errors in segmentation and tracking. Many algorithms have been proposed in the literature that deal with shadows. However, a comparative evaluation of the existing approaches is still lacking. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of moving shadow detection approaches. We organize contributions reported in the literature in four classes two of them are statistical and two are deterministic. We also present a comparative empirical evaluation of representative algorithms selected from these four classes. Novel quantitative (detection and discrimination rate) and qualitative metrics (scene and object independence, flexibility to shadow situations, and robustness to noise) are proposed to evaluate these classes of algorithms on a benchmark suite of indoor and outdoor video sequences.

Another challenging issue investigated is the system grounding. These issues become challenging mainly due to the neutral voltage shift associated with the power converters. The paper shows that converter interactions can be minimized with proper filtering and control on the converters. The paper also proposes a grounding scheme and shows that this scheme provides an effective solution by keeping the neutral voltages low under normal conditions and by limiting the fault currents during fault conditions.

The performance criteria we consider are average probability of:error and outage probability. We show that as functions of the average SNR, they can both be characterized by two parameters: the diversity and coding gains. They both exhibit identical diversity orders, but their coding gains in decibels differ by a constant. The diversity and coding gains are found to depend on the behavior of-the random SNR's probability density function only at the origin, or equivalently, on the decaying order of the corresponding moment generating function (i.e., how fast the moment generating function goes to zero as its argument goes to infinity). Diversity and coding gains for diversity combining systems are expressed in terms of the diversity branches' individual diversity and coding gains, where the branches can come from any diversity technique such as space, time, frequency, or, multipath. The proposed analysis offers a simple and unifying approach to evaluating the performance of uncoded and (possibly space-time) coded transmissions over fading channels, and the method applies to almost all digital modulation schemes, including M-ary phaseshift keying, quadrature amplitude modulation, and frequency-shift keying with coherent or noncoherent detection.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2003.815053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1221802","","Fading;Diversity reception;Signal to noise ratio;Probability density function;H infinity control;Frequency diversity;Performance analysis;Digital modulation;Quadrature amplitude modulation;Frequency shift keying","fading channels;error statistics;diversity reception;multipath channels;phase shift keying;quadrature amplitude modulation","parameterization quantifying performance;fading channels;wireless transmissions;random fading channels;signal-to-noise ratio;performance criteria;error probability;SNR;diversity gains;coding gains;probability density function;decaying order;moment generating function;diversity combining systems;multipath;coded transmissions;digital modulation;M-ary phase shift keying;quadrature amplitude modulation;coherent detection;noncoherent detection;outage probability","","937","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We address the issue of cross-layer networking, where the physical and MAC layer knowledge of the wireless medium is shared with higher layers, in order to provide efficient methods of allocating network resources and applications over the Internet. In essence, future networks will need to provide ""impedance matching"" of the instantaneous radio channel conditions and capacity needs with the traffic and congestion conditions found over the packet-based world of the Internet.

To yield more accurate search results, we propose computing a set of PageRank vectors, biased using a set of representative topics, to capture more accurately the notion of importance with respect to a particular topic. For ordinary keyword search queries, we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores for pages satisfying the query using the topic of the query keywords. For searches done in context (e.g., when the search query is performed by highlighting words in a Web page), we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores using the topic of the context in which the query appeared. By using linear combinations of these (precomputed) biased PageRank vectors to generate context-specific importance scores for pages at query time, we show that we can generate more accurate rankings than with a single, generic PageRank vector.

Face to face communication is a real-time process operating at a a time scale in the order of 40 milliseconds. The level of uncertainty at this time scale is considerable, making it necessary for humans and machines to rely on sensory rich perceptual primitives rather than slow symbolic inference processes. In this paper we present progress on one such perceptual primitive. The system automatically detects frontal faces in the video stream and codes them with respect to 7 dimensions in real time: neutral, anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The face finder employs a cascade of feature detectors trained with boosting techniques [15, 2]. The expression recognizer receives image patches located by the face detector. A Gabor representation of the patch is formed and then processed by a bank of SVM classifiers. A novel combination of Adaboost and SVM's enhances performance. The system was tested on the Cohn-Kanade dataset of posed facial expressions [6]. The generalization performance to new subjects for a 7- way forced choice correct. Most interestingly the outputs of the classifier change smoothly as a function of time, providing a potentially valuable representation to code facial expression dynamics in a fully automatic and unobtrusive manner. The system has been deployed on a wide variety of platforms including Sony's Aibo pet robot, ATR's RoboVie, and CU animator, and is currently being evaluated for applications including automatic reading tutors, assessment of human-robot interaction.","1063-6919","0-7695-1900-8","10.1109/CVPRW.2003.10057","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4624313","","Face;Real time systems;Robots;Pixel;Training;Support vector machines;Gabor filters","","","","237","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The methodology is based on connecting a pulse-width-modulated (PWM) DC/DC SEPIC or Cuk converter between a solar panel and a load or battery bus. The converter operates in discontinuous capacitor voltage mode whilst its input current is continuous. By modulating a small-signal sinusoidal perturbation into the duty cycle of the main switch and comparing the maximum variation in the input voltage and the voltage stress of the main switch, the maximum power point (MPP) of the panel can be located. The nominal duty cycle of the main switch in the converter is adjusted to a value, so that the input resistance of the converter is equal to the equivalent output resistance of the solar panel at the MPP. This approach ensures maximum power transfer under all conditions without using microprocessors for calculation. Detailed mathematical derivations of the MPP tracking technique are included. The tracking capability of the proposed technique has been verified experimentally with a 10-W solar panel at different insolation (incident solar radiation) levels and under large-signal insolation level changes.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2003.810841","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1198049","","Switches;Voltage;Pulse width modulation converters;Switching converters;Power generation;Meteorology;Joining processes;Pulse width modulation;Batteries;Capacitors","DC-DC power convertors;PWM power convertors;solar cell arrays;power control","Cuk converter;SEPIC converter;solar panels;maximum power point tracking technique;meteorological conditions;PWM DC/DC SEPIC converter;load;battery bus;discontinuous capacitor voltage mode;continuous input current;small-signal sinusoidal perturbation modulation;duty cycle;main switch;input resistance;equivalent output resistance;maximum power transfer;microprocessors;tracking capability;large-signal insolation level changes;10 W","","143","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This can be compared to the ideal winding factor of one, which can easily be acquired using distributed windings. However, by choosing better combinations of the pole and slot numbers for a machine with concentrated windings, the winding factor can be substantially increased. Moreover, it is also possible to achieve low cogging torque without skewing, simply by selecting appropriate combinations.

At each dimension level, the DT is computed by constructing the intersection of the Voronoi diagram whose sites are the feature voxels with each row of the image. This construction is performed efficiently by using the DT in the next lower dimension. The correctness and linear time complexity are demonstrated analytically and verified experimentally. The algorithm may be of practical value since it is relatively simple and easy to implement and it is relatively fast (not only does it run in O(N) time but the time constant is small).

In this paper, a new V/f control method is proposed for motor drives for stable operation in a wide frequency range. The magnitude of the voltage is controlled in order to maintain a constant stator flux linkage in the PMSM. The applied frequency is modulated proportional to the input power perturbations to stabilize the drive for a wide frequency range. No position sensor is required to implement this stabilizing technique. The small-signal analysis and the experimental results confirm the effectiveness of this stabilizing technique.

The method is based on the identification of single motor unit action potentials from the surface EMG signal with the use of the continuous wavelet transform. A manifestation variable is computed as the maximum of the outputs of a bank of matched filters at different scales. A threshold is applied to the manifestation variable to detect EMG activity. A model, based on the physical structure of the muscle, is used to test the proposed technique on synthetic signals with known features. The resultant bias of the onset estimate is lower than 40 ms and the standard deviation lower than 30 ms in case of additive colored Gaussian noise with signal-to-noise ratio as low as 2 dB.

Under bad weather conditions, the light reaching a camera is severely scattered by the atmosphere. The resulting decay in contrast varies across the scene and is exponential in the depths of scene points. Therefore, traditional space invariant image processing techniques are not sufficient to remove weather effects from images. We present a physics-based model that describes the appearances of scenes in uniform bad weather conditions. Changes in intensities of scene points under different weather conditions provide simple constraints to detect depth discontinuities in the scene and also to compute scene structure. Then, a fast algorithm to restore scene contrast is presented. In contrast to previous techniques, our weather removal algorithm does not require any a priori scene structure, distributions of scene reflectances, or detailed knowledge about the particular weather condition. All the methods described in this paper are effective under a wide range of weather conditions including haze, mist, fog, and conditions arising due to other aerosols. Further, our methods can be applied to gray scale, RGB color, multispectral and even IR images.

The architecture benefits from various optimizations performed at three levels of abstraction in system design-namely LDPC code design, decoding algorithm, and decoder architecture. First, the interconnect complexity problem of current decoder implementations is mitigated by designing architecture-aware LDPC codes having embedded structural regularity features that result in a regular and scalable message-transport network with reduced control overhead. Second, the memory overhead problem in current day decoders is reduced by more than 75% by employing a new turbo decoding algorithm for LDPC codes that removes the multiple checkto-bit message update bottleneck of the current algorithm. A new merged-schedule merge-passing algorithm is also proposed that reduces the memory overhead of the current algorithm for low to moderate-throughput decoders. Moreover, a parallel soft-input-soft-output (SISO) message update mechanism is proposed that implements the recursions of the Balh-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) algorithm in terms of simple ""max-quartet"" operations that do not require lookup-tables and incur negligible loss in performance compared to the ideal case. Finally, an efficient programmable architecture coupled with a scalable and dynamic transport network for storing and routing messages is proposed, and a full-decoder architecture is presented. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed architecture attains a throughput of 1.92 Gb/s for a frame length of 2304 bits, and achieves savings of 89.13% and 69.83% in power consumption and silicon area over state-of-the-art, with a reduction of 60.5% in interconnect length.","1557-9999","","10.1109/TVLSI.2003.817545","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1255474","","Parity check codes;Decoding;Algorithm design and analysis;Memory architecture;Design optimization;Performance loss;Routing;Throughput;Energy consumption;Silicon","silicon;elemental semiconductors;parity check codes;decoding;algorithm theory;turbo codes;network routing;power consumption;VLSI;integrated circuit interconnections","low-density parity-check decoders;memory-efficient decoder;turbo decoding algorithm;optimizations;interconnect complexity;scalable message-transport network;memory overhead;multiple check to-bit message;merged-schedule merge-passing algorithm;soft-input soft-output message update mechanism;Balh-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv algorithm;dynamic transport network;storing;routing messages;silicon;interconnect length;power consumption;288 byte","","385","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It also offers the advantage of providing a clear understanding of the effects of mutual coupling and input match on the diversity performance of the antenna system.","0013-5194","","10.1049/el:20030495","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1199929","","","antenna theory;diversity reception;S-parameters;electromagnetic coupling;impedance matching","antenna system diversity performance;input parameter description;envelope correlation;the S-parameter description;mutual coupling;input match","","399","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals"

The vector control with a synchronous reference frame current regulator was implemented with challenging requirements such as an extremely low stator inductance (28 /spl mu/H), a high DC-link voltage (600 V), and a high excitation frequency (1.2 kHz). Because the conventional position sensor is not reliable at super-high speed, two different schemes were proposed to measure the position of the rotor. As a first step, a vector control with three discrete Hall sensors was proposed. Because the discrete Hall sensors provide rough position information with a resolution of /spl plusmn/30/spl deg/, a position estimation algorithm was proposed to derive the precise position. Subsequently, a vector control scheme without any position sensor was proposed. The proposed sensorless algorithm was implemented by processing the output voltage of the proportional plus integral current regulator. Therefore, the structure is simple and the estimated speed is robust to the measurement noise. An experimental system was built and the proposed control was implemented and evaluated with and without the discrete Hall sensors. The test results, up to a speed of 65000 r/min, confirmed the validity of the proposed control.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2003.810658","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1201550","","Machine vector control;Regulators;Velocity measurement;Synchronous motors;Stators;Inductance;Frequency;Position measurement;Voltage;Noise robustness","permanent magnet motors;synchronous motor drives;machine vector control;compressors;electric current control;stators;inductance;Hall effect devices;parameter estimation;two-term control","sensorless vector control;super-high-speed PMSM;turbo-compressor;vector control schemes;variable-speed permanent-magnet synchronous motor drive;super-high-speed applications;synchronous reference frame current regulator;extremely low stator inductance;high DC-link voltage;high excitation frequency;discrete Hall sensors;rough position information;position estimation algorithm;output voltage processing;measurement noise;131 kW;600 V;1.2 kHz","","149","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

After achieving final orbit, MODIS began Earth observations in late February 2000 and has been acquiring data since that time. The instrument is also being flown on the Aqua spacecraft, launched in May 2002. A comprehensive set of remote sensing algorithms for cloud detection and the retrieval of cloud physical and optical properties have been developed by members of the MODIS atmosphere science team. The archived products from these algorithms have applications in climate change studies, climate modeling, numerical weather prediction, as well as fundamental atmospheric research. In addition to an extensive cloud mask, products include cloud-top properties (temperature, pressure, effective emissivity), cloud thermodynamic phase, cloud optical and microphysical parameters (optical thickness, effective particle radius, water path), as well as derived statistics. We will describe the various algorithms being used for the remote sensing of cloud properties from MODIS data with an emphasis on the pixel-level retrievals (referred to as Level-2 products), with 1-km or 5-km spatial resolution at nadir. An example of each Level-2 cloud product from a common data granule (5 min of data) off the coast of South America will be discussed. Future efforts will also be mentioned.

Using the exact expression of the c.f., the probability density function (pdf) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) can be easily obtained, thus enabling the exact evaluation of the outage and mean capacity of spatially correlated MIMO channels. Our results are valid for scenarios with the number of transmitting antennas greater than or equal to that of receiving antennas with arbitrary correlation among them. Moreover, the results are valid for an arbitrary number of transmitting and receiving antennas in uncorrelated MIMO channels. It is shown that the capacity loss is negligible even with a correlation coefficient between two adjacent antennas as large as 0.5 for exponential correlation model.

In this paper, we present the calculation and measurement of coupling coefficient for capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs). The finite element method (FEM) is used for our calculations, and the FEM results are compared with the analytical results obtained with parallel plate approximation. The effect of series and parallel capacitances in the CMUT also is investigated. The FEM calculations of the CMUT indicate that the electromechanical coupling coefficient is independent of any series capacitance that may exist in the structure. The series capacitance, however, alters the collapse voltage of the membrane. The parallel parasitic capacitance that may exist in a CMUT or is external to the transducer reduces the coupling coefficient at a given bias voltage. At the collapse, regardless of the parasitics, the coupling coefficient reaches unity. Our experimental measurements confirm a coupling coefficient of 0.85 before collapse, and measurements are in agreement with theory.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2003.1197968","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1197968","","Ultrasonic variables measurement;Ultrasonic transducers;Biomembranes;Voltage;Electrodes;Mechanical energy;Parasitic capacitance;Piezoelectric transducers;Bandwidth;Capacitors","ultrasonic transducers;micromachining;capacitive sensors;microsensors;electromechanical effects;membranes;finite element analysis","electromechanical coupling coefficient;capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer;figure of merit;finite element method;parallel plate approximation;series capacitance;parallel capacitance;membrane collapse voltage","Computer Simulation;Electric Capacitance;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Finite Element Analysis;Miniaturization;Models, Theoretical;Sensitivity and Specificity;Transducers;Ultrasonography","143","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Minimum mean brightness error bi-histogram equalization in contrast enhancement","Soong-Der Chen; A. R. Ramli","Putra Malaysia Univ., Serdang, Malaysia; Putra Malaysia Univ., Serdang, Malaysia","IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","","2003","49","4","1310","1319","Histogram equalization (HE) is widely used for contrast enhancement. However, it tends to change the brightness of an image and hence, not suitable for consumer electronic products, where preserving the original brightness is essential to avoid annoying artifacts. Bi-histogram equalization (BBHE) has been proposed and analyzed mathematically that it can preserve the original brightness to a certain extends. However, there are still cases that are not handled well by BBHE, as they require higher degree of preservation. This paper proposes a novel extension of BBHE referred to as minimum mean brightness error bi-histogram equalization (MMBEBHE) to provide maximum brightness preservation. BBHE separates the input image's histogram into two based on input mean before equalizing them independently. This paper proposes to perform the separation based on the threshold level, which would yield minimum absolute mean brightness error (AMBE - the absolute difference between input and output mean). An efficient recursive integer-based computation for AMBE has been formulated to facilitate real time implementation. Simulation results using sample image which represent images with very low, very high and medium mean brightness show that the cases which are not handled well by HE, BBHE and dualistic sub image histogram equalization (DSIHE), can be properly enhanced by MMBEBHE. Besides, MMBEBHE also demonstrate comparable performance with BBHE and DSIHE when come to use the sample images show in [Yeong-Taeg Kim, February 1997] and [Yu Wan et al., October 5 1999].","1558-4127","","10.1109/TCE.2003.1261234","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1261234","","Brightness;Histograms;Consumer electronics;Computational modeling;Entropy;Probability distribution;Dynamic range;Biomedical image processing;Radar imaging","image enhancement;brightness;mathematical analysis;image sampling","contrast enhancement;image brightness;mathematical analysis;minimum mean brightness error bihistogram equalization;maximum brightness preservation;threshold level;absolute mean brightness error;recursive integer-based computation;image sampling;dualistic sub image histogram equalization","","458","","4","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The PIFA is designed to operate with a ground plane and the ground plane is an integral part of the antenna assembly. In fact, the ground plane size is the limiting factor for the PIFA in many applications. Some work has been reported on the performance of PIFAs mounted on a conducting box of fixed size; however, what is lacking is a parametric study on the antenna behaviour as a function of geometry or antenna position and orientation on a finite ground plane. The paper presents results from a comprehensive investigation on the performance of a conventional PIFA mounted on ground planes of various sizes and shapes. The orientation and position of the antenna on a fixed-size ground plane is analysed. The influence of ground plane geometry on resonant frequency, bandwidth, gain, and radiation patterns are presented. These results are very useful in the design of a PIFA for applications requiring a small ground plane. Specifically, the results show the trade-offs between PIFA geometry and ground plane size with electrical performance.

The proposed approach is based on three steps. First, the composition of geodesic opening and closing operations of different sizes is used in order to build a differential morphological profile that records image structural information. Although, the original panchromatic image only has one data channel, the use of the composition operations will give many additional channels, which may contain redundancies. Therefore, feature extraction or feature selection is applied in the second step. Both discriminant analysis feature extraction and decision boundary feature extraction are investigated in the second step along with a simple feature selection based on picking the largest indexes of the differential morphological profiles. Third, a neural network is used to classify the features from the second step. The proposed approach is applied in experiments on high-resolution Indian Remote Sensing 1C (IRS-1C) and IKONOS remote sensing data from urban areas. In experiments, the proposed method performs well in terms of classification accuracies. It is seen that relatively few features are needed to achieve the same classification accuracies as in the original feature space.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.814625","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232208","","Feature extraction;Remote sensing;Urban areas;Morphology;Image segmentation;Image edge detection;Shape;Neural networks;Councils;Image processing","terrain mapping;feature extraction;image classification;mathematical morphology;remote sensing","image classification;remote sensing images;feature selection;high-resolution imagery;morphological transformations;mathematical morphology;feature extraction;panchromatic high-resolution data;urban areas;differential morphological profile;structural information;discriminant analysis;neural network;Indian Remote Sensing 1C data;IKONOS","","476","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method has good harmonic rejection and large tolerance to parameter variations. To further reduce the steady-state error, a low-pass-filter Q(z) algorithm is applied. The DC bias problem is also taken into consideration and solved with the repetitive controller itself.

For the ridged horn antenna it is found that the radiation pattern, contrary to common belief, does not maintain a single main lobe in the direction of the horn axis over the full frequency range. Instead, at frequencies above 12 GHz, the main lobe in the radiation pattern starts to split into four large side lobes pointing in off-axis directions with a dip of up to 6 dB between them along the main axis. Although this type of horn is the preferred test antenna, which is in common use for over four decades, no explanation for this unwanted behavior was found in the open literature. To investigate this phenomenon in detail, a method of moments approach has been adopted to simulate the complete antenna system. The simulations are in good agreement with the measurements over the 1-18-GHz operational bandwidth and indicate that the use of this type of horn antenna in EMC applications remains questionable.","1558-187X","","10.1109/TEMC.2002.808022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1180393","","Horn antennas;Antenna radiation patterns;Antenna theory;Electromagnetic compatibility;Moment methods;Simulation","horn antennas;antenna radiation patterns;antenna theory;electromagnetic compatibility;broadband antennas;method of moments;simulation","electromagnetic simulation;broadband horn antenna;double-ridged horn antenna;coaxial input feed section;radiation pattern deterioration;side lobes;off-axis directions;EMC test antenna;method of moments approach;frequency-domain MoM simulations;microwave antenna;EMC applications;1 to 18 GHz;12 GHz","","113","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper focuses on the last issue and describes a new scheme for iris recognition from an image sequence. We first assess the quality of each image in the input sequence and select a clear iris image from such a sequence for subsequent recognition. A bank of spatial filters, whose kernels are suitable for iris recognition, is then used to capture local characteristics of the iris so as to produce discriminating texture features. Experimental results show that the proposed method has an encouraging performance. In particular, a comparative study of existing methods for iris recognition is conducted on an iris image database including 2,255 sequences from 213 subjects.

We provide an analytic approach for the systematic development of controllers that will cause an autonomous vehicle to accomplish a smooth lane change suitable for use in an Automated Highway System. The design is motivated by the discontinuous availability of valid preview data from the sensing systems during lane-to-lane transitions. The task is accomplished by the generation of a virtual yaw reference and the utilization of a robust switching controller to generate steering commands that cause the vehicle to track that reference. In this way, the open loop lane change problem is converted into an equivalent virtual reference trajectory tracking problem. The approach considers optimality in elapsed time at an operating longitudinal velocity. Although the analysis is performed assuming that the road is straight, the generalization of the proposed algorithm to arbitrary road segments is rather straightforward. The outlined lane change algorithm has been implemented and tested on The Ohio State University test vehicles.

Past approaches have built detectors based on appearance information, but ours is the first to combine both sources of information in a single detector. The implementation described runs at about 4 frames/second, detects pedestrians at very small scales (as small as 20/spl times/15 pixels), and has a very low false positive rate.

Conventional security mechanisms such as access control and encryption do not directly address the enforcement of information-flow policies. Previously, a promising new approach has been developed: the use of programming-language techniques for specifying and enforcing information-flow policies. In this paper, we survey the past three decades of research on information-flow security, particularly focusing on work that uses static program analysis to enforce information-flow policies.

The proposed framework includes some novel low-level processing algorithms, such as dominant color region detection, robust shot boundary detection, and shot classification, as well as some higher-level algorithms for goal detection, referee detection, and penalty-box detection. The system can output three types of summaries: i) all slow-motion segments in a game; ii) all goals in a game; iii) slow-motion segments classified according to object-based features. The first two types of summaries are based on cinematic features only for speedy processing, while the summaries of the last type contain higher-level semantics. The proposed framework is efficient, effective, and robust. It is efficient in the sense that there is no need to compute object-based features when cinematic features are sufficient for the detection of certain events, e.g., goals in soccer. It is effective in the sense that the framework can also employ object-based features when needed to increase accuracy (at the expense of more computation). The efficiency, effectiveness, and robustness of the proposed framework are demonstrated over a large data set, consisting of more than 13 hours of soccer video, captured in different countries and under different conditions.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2003.812758","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1212655","","Gunshot detection systems;Event detection;Robustness;Games;Color;Computer vision;Narrowband;IP networks;Production;Shape","image colour analysis;image classification;video signal processing;sport;feature extraction;object detection;image segmentation","automatic video analysis;automatic video summarization;soccer video analysis;cinematic feature extraction;object-based features;low-level processing algorithms;dominant color region detection;shot boundary detection;shot classification;goal detection;referee detection;penalty-box detection;slow-motion segments","","509","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Dept., Imperial Coll., London, UK; NA","IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","","2003","48","4","590","606","A new method to design asymptotically stabilizing and adaptive control laws for nonlinear systems is presented. The method relies upon the notions of system immersion and manifold invariance and, in principle, does not require the knowledge of a (control) Lyapunov function. The construction of the stabilizing control laws resembles the procedure used in nonlinear regulator theory to derive the (invariant) output zeroing manifold and its friend. The method is well suited in situations where we know a stabilizing controller of a nominal reduced order model, which we would like to robustify with respect to higher order dynamics. This is achieved by designing a control law that asymptotically immerses the full system dynamics into the reduced order one. We also show that in adaptive control problems the method yields stabilizing schemes that counter the effect of the uncertain parameters adopting a robustness perspective. Our construction does not invoke certainty equivalence, nor requires a linear parameterization, furthermore, viewed from a Lyapunov perspective, it provides a procedure to add cross terms between the parameter estimates and the plant states. Finally, it is shown that the proposed approach is directly applicable to systems in feedback and feedforward form, yielding new stabilizing control laws. We illustrate the method with several academic and practical examples, including a mechanical system with flexibility modes, an electromechanical system with parasitic actuator dynamics and an adaptive nonlinearly parameterized visual servoing application.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2003.809820","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1193738","","Adaptive control;Nonlinear systems;Control systems;Robust control;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Design methodology;Lyapunov method;Regulators;Reduced order systems;Counting circuits","nonlinear control systems;adaptive control;asymptotic stability;control system synthesis;Lyapunov methods;uncertain systems;feedback;feedforward","immersion;invariance;stabilization;adaptive control;nonlinear systems;asymptotically stabilizing control law design;system immersion;manifold invariance;nonlinear regulator theory;high-order dynamics;uncertain parameters;matching conditions;certainty equivalence;linear parameterization;Lyapunov perspective;cross terms;feedback;feedforward;electromechanical system;parasitic actuator dynamics;adaptive nonlinearly parameterized visual servoing","","406","","44","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This technology is becoming a primary method for generating high-resolution digital terrain models (DTMs) that are essential to numerous applications such as flood modeling and landslide prediction. Airborne LIDAR systems usually return a three-dimensional cloud of point measurements from reflective objects scanned by the laser beneath the flight path. In order to generate a DTM, measurements from nonground features such as buildings, vehicles, and vegetation have to be classified and removed. In this paper, a progressive morphological filter was developed to detect nonground LIDAR measurements. By gradually increasing the window size of the filter and using elevation difference thresholds, the measurements of vehicles, vegetation, and buildings are removed, while ground data are preserved. Datasets from mountainous and flat urbanized areas were selected to test the progressive morphological filter. The results show that the filter can remove most of the nonground points effectively.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.810682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1202973","","Filters;Laser radar;Vegetation mapping;Area measurement;Surfaces;Digital elevation models;Floods;Predictive models;Terrain factors;Clouds","topography (Earth);terrain mapping;geophysical techniques;geophysical signal processing;optical radar;remote sensing by laser beam;image processing","geophysical measurement technique;airborne lidar;land surface topography;terrain mapping;progressive morphological filter;nonground feature removal;geodesy;vehicles;vegetation;buildings;image processing;laser remote sensing","","456","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a double check these analytical results are validated by Monte Carlo simulations and as an illustration of the mathematical formalism some numerical examples for particular cases of interest are plotted and discussed. These results show that, given a fixed number of total antenna elements and under the same scattering condition (1) SIMO systems are equivalent to multiple-input-single-output systems and (2) it is preferable to distribute the number of antenna elements evenly between the transmitter and the receiver for a minimum outage probability performance.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2003.809720","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1192179","","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Performance analysis;MIMO;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Closed-form solution;Probability;Diversity reception;Array signal processing;Rayleigh channels","MIMO systems;diversity reception;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;matrix algebra;statistical analysis;Rician channels;Monte Carlo methods;probability;Rayleigh channels","largest eigenvalue;performance analysis;statistical results;closed-form expressions;multiple-input-multiple-output systems;wireless communication systems;MIMO systems;maximal ratio combining;beamforming systems;Rician-fading channels;single-input-multipleoutput systems;SIMO systems;Monte Carlo simulations;scattering condition;multiple-input-single-output systems;antenna elements;transmitter;receiver;minimum outage probability performance;MIMO MRC systems;Khatri distribution;central complex Wishart matrices","","242","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"An EM algorithm for wavelet-based image restoration","M. A. T. Figueiredo; R. D. Nowak","Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Inst. of Telecommun., Lisboa, Portugal; NA","IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","","2003","12","8","906","916","This paper introduces an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for image restoration (deconvolution) based on a penalized likelihood formulated in the wavelet domain. Regularization is achieved by promoting a reconstruction with low-complexity, expressed in the wavelet coefficients, taking advantage of the well known sparsity of wavelet representations. Previous works have investigated wavelet-based restoration but, except for certain special cases, the resulting criteria are solved approximately or require demanding optimization methods. The EM algorithm herein proposed combines the efficient image representation offered by the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with the diagonalization of the convolution operator obtained in the Fourier domain. Thus, it is a general-purpose approach to wavelet-based image restoration with computational complexity comparable to that of standard wavelet denoising schemes or of frequency domain deconvolution methods. The algorithm alternates between an E-step based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and a DWT-based M-step, resulting in an efficient iterative process requiring O(NlogN) operations per iteration. The convergence behavior of the algorithm is investigated, and it is shown that under mild conditions the algorithm converges to a globally optimal restoration. Moreover, our new approach performs competitively with, in some cases better than, the best existing methods in benchmark tests.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2003.814255","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1217267","","Image restoration;Wavelet domain;Discrete wavelet transforms;Iterative algorithms;Deconvolution;Image reconstruction;Wavelet coefficients;Optimization methods;Image representation;Discrete Fourier transforms","image restoration;deconvolution;discrete wavelet transforms;computational complexity;fast Fourier transforms","EM algorithm;wavelet-based image restoration;expectation-maximization algorithm;deconvolution;penalized likelihood;wavelet coefficients;sparsity;convolution operator;discrete wavelet transform;computational complexity;wavelet denoising schemes;frequency domain deconvolution methods;fast Fourier transform;iterative process;globally optimal restoration;benchmark tests","","647","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An array of antennas is located near the surface of the breast and an ultrawideband (UWB) signal is transmitted sequentially from each antenna. The received backscattered signals are passed through a space-time beamformer that is designed to image backscattered signal energy as a function of location. The beamformer spatially focuses the backscattered signals to discriminate against clutter and noise while compensating for frequency-dependent propagation effects. As a consequence of the significant dielectric-properties contrast between normal and malignant tissue, localized regions of large backscatter energy levels in the image correspond to malignant tumors. A data-adaptive algorithm for removing artifacts in the received signals due to backscatter from the skin-breast interface is also presented. The effectiveness of these algorithms is demonstrated using a variety of numerical breast phantoms based on anatomically realistic MRI-derived FDTD models of the breast. Very small (2 mm) malignant tumors embedded within the complex fibroglandular structure of the breast are easily detected above the background clutter. The MIST approach is shown to offer significant improvement in performance over previous UWB microwave breast cancer detection techniques based on simpler focusing schemes.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2003.815446","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1219578","","Microwave imaging;Array signal processing;Cancer detection;Breast cancer;Microwave theory and techniques;Transmitting antennas;Ultra wideband antennas;Backscatter;Malignant tumors;Antenna arrays","microwave imaging;cancer;tumours;medical image processing;backscatter;clutter;dielectric properties;biological tissues;adaptive signal processing;biomedical MRI;finite difference time-domain analysis","microwave imaging;space-time beamforming;early-stage breast cancer detection;antenna array;ultrawideband signal;UWB signal;received backscattered signals;image backscattered signal energy;clutter discrimination;noise discrimination;frequency-dependent propagation effects;dielectric-properties;malignant tissue;normal tissue;localized regions;backscatter energy levels;malignant tumors;data-adaptive algorithm;artifacts removal;skin-breast interface;received signals;numerical breast phantoms;MRI-derived FDTD models;fibroglandular structure;background clutter;UWB microwave breast cancer detection;focusing schemes","","447","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the TTA, this global time is used to precisely specify the interfaces among the nodes, to simplify the communication and agreement protocols, to perform prompt error detection, and to guarantee the timeliness of real-time applications. The TTA supports a two-phased design methodology, architecture design, and component design. During the architecture design phase, the interactions among the distributed components and the interfaces of the components are fully specified in the value domain and in the temporal domain. In the succeeding component implementation phase, the components are built, taking these interface specifications as constraints.

In PM machines, iron losses form a significant fraction of the total loss partly due to the nonsinusoidal flux density distribution. Design optimization therefore requires good means of predicting these iron losses. Finite-element analysis can be employed but this approach is cumbersome and costly when used in the many iterations needed in optimizing the design. This paper presents a set of improved approximate models for the prediction of iron loss. They can be used in design optimization programs and, since they are directly related to machine dimensions and material properties, they also provide quick insight into the effects of design changes. A time-stepped finite-element method is employed to evaluate the iron losses in a range of typical PM machines and the results are used to evaluate the adequacy of the models. The predictions of overall iron losses are then compared with measurements made on two PM motors.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2003.810635","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1201541","","Iron;Synchronous motors;Design optimization;Induction motors;Finite element methods;Potential energy;Rotors;Stators;Reactive power;Predictive models","permanent magnet motors;synchronous motor drives;machine theory;finite element analysis;iterative methods;magnetic flux;rotors;stators;eddy current losses","permanent-magnet synchronous motors;iron losses modeling;potential energy savings;rotor loss elimination;stator loss reduction;unity power factor;nonsinusoidal flux density distribution;design optimization;iron losses;finite-element analysis;iterations;time-stepped finite-element method;tooth eddy-current-loss model;yoke eddy-current-loss model","","129","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The first function used in the decomposition is of bounded variation, representing the underlying image structure, while the second function captures the texture and possible noise. The region of missing information in the bounded variation image is reconstructed using image inpainting algorithms, while the same region in the texture image is filled-in with texture synthesis techniques. The original image is then reconstructed adding back these two sub-images.

It functions as the ideal antenna groundplane for wireless applications because it simultaneously enhances the gain of the antenna as it suppresses the surface waves associated with it (thus reducing the undesired back-lobe and the reactive coupling to nearby circuits). These two properties are known to occur approximately over the frequency bandwidth where the phase of the reflection coefficient of the surface changes from +90/spl deg/ to -90/spl deg/. Since this behavior takes place at frequencies where the unit cell of the structure is small compared to the wavelength, it can be modeled in terms of a layered homogeneous material where each layer has an anisotropic magneto-dielectric tensor. These tensors, readily derived using an effective medium model, can be designed to obtain independent control of the bandwidths of gain increase and surface wave suppression. Based on a transverse resonance model of the effective medium material model, it is shown that Sievenpiper high-impedance surfaces exist that can suppress TE surface waves alone or TM surface waves alone, or both TE and TM surface waves at the same time. Maximum TM surface wave suppression bandwidth is obtained when the distance between the vias in the via array is as close as possible to /spl lambda//2. Maximum TE bandwidth is obtained when the conductors of the capacitive FSS offer maximum blockage to the normal magnetic field of the wave. A reduction of the transverse resonance solution to nearly closed form is used to obtain a simple picture of the design space available when the desired operating frequency is fixed.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2003.817575","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1236086","","Design methodology;Conductors;Surface waves;Bandwidth;Frequency selective surfaces;Magnetic materials;Tellurium;Magnetic anisotropy;Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy;Magnetic resonance","permittivity;antenna arrays;radio equipment;frequency selective surfaces;electromagnetic wave propagation;surface electromagnetic waves;magnetic fields;resonance","Sievenpiper high-impedance surfaces;artificial magnetic conductor;positive gain electrically small antennas;periodic structure;substrate;vertical vias array;capacitive frequency selective surface;capacitive FSS;antenna groundplane;wireless applications;surface waves suppression;reactive coupling;frequency bandwidth;reflection coefficient phase;unit cell;layered homogeneous material;anisotropic magneto-dielectric tensor;effective medium model;gain bandwidth;transverse resonance model;TE surface waves;TM face waves;distance;conductors;magnetic field;transverse resonance;closed form solution","","120","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

PECon 2003.","","2003","","","268","271","As solar energy is a part of widely recognized renewable energy sources; the solar energy source is free of cost and clean energy whereby environmental impacts are negligible. In tropical countries like Malaysia, solar energy potential has been utilized in wide range of applications of remote and urban areas and has been growing rapidly. There are also new research interests shown by the universities and R&D institutions to assess the solar energy application potential in Malaysia for proper utilization. But it has not fully utilized until recently. However the main problems limiting solar utilization are the use of costly equipment and the selection of wrong peak sunshine data that results wrong sizing of equipment for the solar energy projects. For instance, peak sunshine and insolation figures in daily, weekly and yearly basis of the same location are different from one data to another if accuracy of the solar energy data is compromised. This is because the data available is based on average with yearly basis, which has nothing to do with actual data available in a specific place and a specific date. It is therefore, very important to form proper design procedures and solar energy components sizing to do exact calculations for the solar power production before opting any actual implementation of solar energy scheme. Universal and local data will be compared to come up with the required peak sunshine figures in order to get the exact amount sunshine in a particular zone and in a particular day. The problems involved in right sizing and using the right data are the key success to solar energy applications, improve its performances and reduce unnecessary costs. For that reason, carrying out proper design & sizing procedures for practical solar energy schemes are necessary. In this work, proper design procedures and system sizing are the main focus.

Although Web page annotations could facilitate such knowledge gathering, annotations are rare and will probably never be rich or detailed enough to cover all the knowledge these documents contain. Manual annotation is impractical and unscalable, and automatic annotation tools remain largely undeveloped. Specialized knowledge services therefore require tools that can search and extract specific knowledge directly from unstructured text on the Web, guided by an ontology that details what type of knowledge to harvest. An ontology uses concepts and relations to classify domain knowledge. Other researchers have used ontologies to support knowledge extraction, but few have explored their full potential in this domain. The paper considers the Artequakt project which links a knowledge extraction tool with an ontology to achieve continuous knowledge support and guide information extraction. The extraction tool searches online documents and extracts knowledge that matches the given classification structure. It provides this knowledge in a machine-readable format that will be automatically maintained in a knowledge base (KB).

Previous qualitative research suggests that distributed development may increase development cycle time for individual work items (modification requests). We use both data from the source code change management system and survey data to model the extent of delay in a distributed software development organization and explore several possible mechanisms for this delay. One key finding is that distributed work items appear to take about two and one-half times as long to complete as similar items where all the work is colocated. The data strongly suggest a mechanism for the delay, i.e., that distributed work items involve more people than comparable same-site work items, and the number of people involved is strongly related to the calendar time to complete a work item. We replicate the analysis of change data in a different organization with a different product and different sites and confirm our main findings. We also report survey results showing differences between same-site and distributed social networks, testing several hypotheses about characteristics of distributed social networks that may be related to delay.

Expressions for the multivariate PDF in these cases are obtained in integral form as well as in the form of a series of products of univariate PDFs. We also derive a general expression for the multivariate exponential characteristic function (CF) in terms of determinants. In the exchangeable and exponentially correlated cases, CF expressions are obtained in the form of a series of products of univariate gamma CFs. The CF of the sum of exponential variates in these cases is obtained in closed form. Finally, the bivariate case is presented mentioning its main features.

Jerk limitation is important in industrial robot applications, since it results in improved path tracking and reduced wear on the robot. The method described herein uses a concatenation of fifth-order polynomials to provide a smooth trajectory between two way points. The trajectory approximates a linear segment with parabolic blends trajectory. A sine wave template is used to calculate the end conditions (control points) for ramps from zero acceleration to nonzero acceleration. Joining these control points with quintic polynomials results in a controlled quintic trajectory that does not oscillate, and is near time optimal for the jerk and acceleration limits specified. The method requires only the computation of the quintic control points, up to a maximum of eight points per trajectory way point. This provides hard bounds for online motion algorithm computation time. A method for blending these straight-line trajectories over a series of way points is also discussed.

We consider random discrete dopants, trapped charges, atomic-scale interface roughness, and line edge roughness as sources of intrinsic parameter fluctuations. The presented theoretical approach based on Green's functions is restricted to the case of random discrete charges. The numerical simulation approaches based on the drift diffusion approximation with density gradient quantum corrections covers all of the listed sources of fluctuations. The results show that the intrinsic fluctuations in conventional MOSFETs, and later in double gate architectures, will reach levels that will affect the yield and the functionality of the next generation analog and digital circuits unless appropriate changes to the design are made.

While it is certainly true that government public policies and regulations have played a major role in the rapidly growing rate at which distributed generation is penetrating the market, it is also the case that a number of technologies have reached a development stage allowing for large-scale implementation within existing electric utility systems. At the onset of any discussion related to distributed generation, one question begs to be answered: is the fact that electric power producing facilities are distributed actually a new and revolutionary concept? Have power plants not always been located across broad expanses of land? The answer to these questions clearly is that electric power plants have always been sited all across the service territories of the utilities owning them. Hence, the opening question: as with many so-called innovations that have been put forward during the recent past, is the entire concept of distributed generation a simple semantic marketing hype or are we actually at the dawn of a new electric power generation era? We believe that a new electric power production industry is emerging, and that it will rely on a broad array of new technologies. This article sets the stage for distributed generation covering such topics as: the present power production situation; what distributed generation is; capability ratings and system interfaces; market penetration of internal combustion engine generators, fuel cells and microturbines; potential generation mix issues, network considerations including power quality, reactive power coordination, reliability and reserve margin, reliability, network redundancy, safety and accountability; public policy and regulatory impact; and standards.","1558-4216","","10.1109/MPAE.2003.1180357","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1180357","","Distributed control;Power generation;Power system reliability;Distributed power generation;Power industry;Public policy;Government;Large-scale systems;Technological innovation;Production","distributed power generation;government policies;fuel cells;diesel-electric generators;gas turbines","electric utility industry restructuring;government public policies;government regulations;distributed generation;power plants;capability ratings;system interfaces;internal combustion engine generators;fuel cells;microturbines;potential generation mix issues;power quality;network considerations;reactive power coordination;reliability;reserve margin;network redundancy;safety;accountability;standards","","201","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Given a 3-D rough environment and assuming flight envelope restrictions, two problems are solved: i) UAV navigation using an offline planner in a known environment, and, ii) UAV navigation using an online planner in a completely unknown environment. The offline planner produces a single B-Spline curve that connects the starting and target points with a predefined initial direction. The online planner, based on the offline one, is given on-board radar readings which gradually produces a smooth 3-D trajectory aiming at reaching a predetermined target in an unknown environment; the produced trajectory consists of smaller B-spline curves smoothly connected with each other.

This article describes the problems encountered in that project, interprets them in terms of modern software projects, and presents some antidotes for those problems.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2003.1184161","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1184161","","Marine vehicles;Contracts;Auditory system;Subcontracting;Springs;Storms;Acceleration;Guns;Fires","software engineering;project management;software management","Royal Swedish Navy;Vasa ship;complex software systems;software projects","","15","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The proposed technique enables the implementation of high-efficiency high-power-density fully regulated CEET systems suitable for applications with a wide input and load range. A high efficiency of the system is achieved by recovering the energy stored in the leakage inductances of the transformer by incorporating them in the operation of the circuit, and by employing high-frequency-inverter and controlled-rectifier topologies that allow a controlled bidirectional power flow through the transformer. In addition, a feedforward variable-switching-frequency control of the inverter is used to maintain approximately constant power transfer through the transformer with the input voltage changes, whereas the output-side rectifier employs a local pulsewidth-modulation control to achieve a tight regulation of the output in the presence of load variations. Specifically, the described CEET system is suitable for use in universal-input battery chargers.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2003.812472","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1203003","","Contacts;Batteries;Control systems;Voltage control;Circuit topology;Bidirectional power flow;Rectifiers;Pulse inverters;Pulse transformers;Load management","mobile handsets;inductive power transmission;battery chargers;rectifying circuits;inductance;invertors;load flow control;transformers;feedforward;frequency control;PWM power convertors","contactless electrical energy transmission;portable-telephone battery chargers;inductive energy transmission principle;high-efficiency;high-power-density;stored energy recovery;leakage inductances;circuit operation;high-frequency-inverter;controlled-rectifier topologies;controlled bidirectional power flow;feedforward variable-switching-frequency control;constant power transfer;input voltage changes;local pulsewidth-modulation control","","291","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These models use a set of scenarios and corresponding probabilities to model the multivariate random data process (electrical load, stream flows to hydro units, and fuel and electricity prices). For most practical problems the optimization problem that contains all possible scenarios is too large. Due to computational complexity and to time limitations this program is often approximated by a model involving a (much) smaller number of scenarios. The proposed reduction algorithms determine a subset of the initial scenario set and assign new probabilities to the preserved scenarios. The scenario tree construction algorithms successively reduce the number of nodes of a fan of individual scenarios by modifying the tree structure and by bundling similar scenarios. Numerical experience is reported for constructing scenario trees for the load and spot market prices entering a stochastic portfolio management model of a German utility.","","0-7803-7967-5","10.1109/PTC.2003.1304379","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1304379","","Energy management;Stochastic processes;Risk management;Portfolios;Fuels;Uncertainty;Load management;Tree data structures;Power system economics;Power generation economics","risk management;optimisation;stochastic processes;computational complexity;power markets;trees (mathematics)","power management problems;tree construction;risk management problems;power utilities;multistage stochastic programs;multivariate random data process;optimization problem;computational complexity;stochastic portfolio management model;scenario reduction","","269","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Univ., South Korea","IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","","2003","49","10","2636","2647","The capacity of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless channels is limited by both the spatial fading correlation and rank deficiency of the channel. While spatial fading correlation reduces the diversity gains, rank deficiency due to double scattering or keyhole effects decreases the spatial multiplexing gains of multiple-antenna channels. In this paper, taking into account realistic propagation environments in the presence of spatial fading correlation, double scattering, and keyhole effects, we analyze the ergodic (or mean) MIMO capacity for an arbitrary finite number of transmit and receive antennas. We assume that the channel is unknown at the transmitter and perfectly known at the receiver so that equal power is allocated to each of the transmit antennas. Using some statistical properties of complex random matrices such as Gaussian matrices, Wishart (1928) matrices, and quadratic forms in the Gaussian matrix, we present a closed-form expression for the ergodic capacity of independent Rayleigh-fading MIMO channels and a tight upper bound for spatially correlated/double scattering MIMO channels. We also derive a closed-form capacity formula for keyhole MIMO channels. This analytic formula explicitly shows that the use of multiple antennas in keyhole channels only offers the diversity advantage, but provides no spatial multiplexing gains. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of our analytical expressions and the tightness of upper bounds.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2003.817439","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1237141","","Fading;MIMO;Rayleigh scattering;Receiving antennas;Upper bound;Diversity methods;Transmitters;Transmitting antennas;Closed-form solution;Rayleigh channels","channel capacity;antenna arrays;Rayleigh channels;correlation methods;electromagnetic wave scattering;MIMO systems;diversity reception;matrix algebra;radiowave propagation","multiple-antenna fading channel;channel capacity;spatial fading correlation;multiple-input multiple-output wireless channels;MIMO wireless channels;rank deficiency;diversity gains;keyhole effects;spatial multiplexing gains;propagation environments;ergodic MIMO capacity;mean MIMO capacity;receive antennas;transmit antennas;statistical properties;complex random matrices;Gaussian matrices;Wishart matrices;quadratic forms;Gaussian matrix;closed-form expression;independent Rayleigh-fading MIMO channels;tight upper bound;spatially correlated/double scattering MIMO channels;closed-form capacity formula;keyhole MIMO channels;keyhole channels","","401","","46","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Ultra-wideband radio technology: potential and challenges ahead","D. Porcino; W. Hirt","NA; NA","IEEE Communications Magazine","","2003","41","7","66","74","An unprecedented transformation in the design, deployment, and application of short-range wireless devices and services is in progress today. This trend is in line with the imminent transition from third- to fourth-generation radio systems, where heterogeneous environments are expected to prevail eventually. A key driver in this transition is the steep growth in both demand and deployment of WLANs/WPANs based on the wireless standards within the IEEE 802 suite. Today, these short-range devices and networks operate mainly standalone in indoor home and office environments or large enclosed public areas, while their integration into the wireless wide-area infrastructure is still nearly nonexistent and far from trivial. This status quo in the short-range wireless application space is about to be disrupted by novel devices and systems based on the emerging UWB radio technology with the potential to provide solutions for many of today's problems in the areas of spectrum management and radio system engineering. The approach employed by UWB radio devices is based on sharing already occupied spectrum resources by means of the overlay principle, rather than looking for still available but possibly unsuitable new bands. This novel radio technology has received legal adoption by the regulatory authorities in the United States, and efforts to achieve this status in Europe and Asia are underway. This article discusses both the application potential and technical challenges presented by UWB radio as an unconventional but promising new wireless technology.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2003.1215641","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1215641","","Ultra wideband technology;Frequency;Bandwidth;Physical layer;Intelligent networks;Availability;Systems engineering and theory;Resource management;FCC;Standardization","radio spectrum management;broadband networks;wireless LAN;telecommunication standards;indoor radio;radio networks","ultra-wideband radio technology;short-range wireless;WLANs;WPANs;IEEE 802;indoor home environments;office environments;large enclosed public areas;wireless wide-area infrastructure;UWB radio technology;spectrum management;radio system engineering;spectrum resources","","635","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Moreton Bay was the only Australian Earth Observing 1 (EO-1) Hyperion coastal site used for calibration/validation activities. This region was selected due to its spatial gradients in optical depth, water quality, bathymetry, and substrate composition. A combination of turbid and humic river inputs, as well as the open ocean flushing, determines the water quality of the bay. The field campaigns were coincident with Hyperion overpasses, retrieved inherent optical properties, apparent optical properties, substrate reflectance spectra, and water quality parameters. Environmental noise calculations demonstrate that Hyperion has sufficient sensitivity to detect optical water quality concentrations of colored dissolved organic matter, chlorophyll, and suspended matter in the complex waters of Moreton Bay. A methodology was developed integrating atmospheric and hydrooptical radiative transfer models (MODTRAN-4, Hydrolight) to estimate the underwater light field.

In addition, a fast and physics-based inductor model is exploited to put the results contributed by many different groups in various technologies and achieved over the past eight years into perspective. Inductors are compared not only by their maximum quality factors (Q/sub max/), but also by taking the frequency at Q/sub max/, the inductance value (L), the self-resonance frequency (f/sub SR/), and the coil area into account. It is further explained that the spiral coil structure on a lossy silicon substrate can operate in three different modes, depending at first order on the silicon doping concentration. Ranging from high to low substrate resistivity, inductor-mode, resonator-mode, and eddy-current regimes are defined by characteristic changes of Q/sub max/, L, and f/sub SR/. The advantages and disadvantages of patterned or blanket resistive ground shields between the inductor coil and substrate and the effect of a substrate contact on the inductor are also addressed in this paper.

MOS varactor topologies include conventional D = S = B connected, inversion-mode (I-MOS), and accumulation-mode (A-MOS) structures. When incorporated into the VCO tank circuit, the large-signal swing of the VCO output oscillation modulates the varactor capacitance in time, resulting in a VCO tuning curve that deviates from the dc tuning curve of the particular varactor structure. This paper presents a detailed analysis of this large-signal effect.

In this paper, the saliency or impedance difference is used as the conventional methods and, nevertheless, in order to amplify the difference containing the information of the rotor angle and to maintain a reasonable performance under any load condition a high-frequency injection scheme is proposed. A speed and position estimation scheme based on the characteristics of the high-frequency impedance is proposed. The scheme extracts the high-frequency impedance components related to the rotor position. An initial angle estimation scheme for starting from an arbitrary rotor position is also proposed. It can distinguish the north magnetic pole position from the south one in several decade milliseconds. The proposed scheme enables position control of a transducerless or position-sensorless IPMM.

The model is very convenient for analytical and numerical performance prediction of complicated narrowband and wideband land mobile satellite systems, with different types of uncoded/coded modulations, with or without diversity. Comparison of the first- and the second-order statistics of the proposed model with different sets of published channel data demonstrates the flexibility of the new model in characterizing a variety of channel conditions and propagation mechanisms over satellite links.

Conventional voltage level shifter circuit using high voltage NMOS and high voltage PMOS operates well on 0.8 /spl mu/m process. However, with the continuous process shrinking, conventional voltage level shifter circuit is not suitable for high voltage power supply due to the reduced breakdown voltage of the high voltage devices. Although stacked high voltage devices can be applied to solve this issue, the circuit will have DC leakage current and the internal high voltage swing problem. This paper describes a new low voltage to high voltage converter circuit. By using all the low voltage devices, the DC leakage current and the high voltage swing node have been eliminated.

The success of many learning schemes, in their attempts to construct models of data, hinges on the reliable identification of a small set of highly predictive attributes. The inclusion of irrelevant, redundant, and noisy attributes in the model building process phase can result in poor predictive performance and increased computation. Attribute selection generally involves a combination of search and attribute utility estimation plus evaluation with respect to specific learning schemes. This leads to a large number of possible permutations and has led to a situation where very few benchmark studies have been conducted. This paper presents a benchmark comparison of several attribute selection methods for supervised classification. All the methods produce an attribute ranking, a useful devise for isolating the individual merit of an attribute. Attribute selection is achieved by cross-validating the attribute rankings with respect to a classification learner to find the best attributes. Results are reported for a selection of standard data sets and two diverse learning schemes C4.5 and naive Bayes.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2003.1245283","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1245283","","Data mining;Predictive models;Decision trees;Training data;Data engineering;Reliability engineering;Fasteners;Phase noise;Buildings;Testing","data mining;pattern classification;learning (artificial intelligence);Bayes methods;feature extraction","discrete class data mining;attribute selection technique benchmarking;data engineering;predictive attribute identification;search;attribute utility estimation;supervised classification;attribute ranking;classification learner;C4.5 learning scheme;naive Bayes learning scheme","","638","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, evolutionary computation (EC) methods such as genetic algorithm (GA), micro GA (MGA), and evolutionary programming (EP) are applied to obtain ELD solutions for three-, six-, and 13-unit systems. Investigations showed that EP was better among EC methods in solving the ELD problem.

The NRI metamaterial sections consist of lumped element capacitors and inductors, arranged in a dual TL (high-pass) configuration. By adjusting the NRI-medium lumped element values, the phase shift can be tailored to a given specification. Periodic analysis is applied to the structure and design equations are presented for the determination of the lumped element parameters for any arbitrary phase shift. To validate the design, various phase shifters are simulated and tested in coplanar waveguide (CPW) technology. It is demonstrated that small variations in the NRI-medium lumped element values can produce positive, negative or 0/spl deg/ phase shifts while maintaining the same short overall length. Thus, the new phase shifter offers some significant advantages over conventional delay lines: it is more compact in size, it exhibits a linear phase response around the design frequency, it can incur a phase lead or lag which is independent of the length of the structure and it exhibits shorter group delays.","1548-5757","","10.1109/LAWP.2003.815280","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1214903","","Metamaterials;Phase shifters;Coplanar waveguides;Refractive index;Transmission lines;Capacitors;Inductors;Periodic structures;Equations;Testing","refractive index;UHF phase shifters;microwave phase shifters;microstrip lines;capacitors;inductors;coplanar waveguide components;periodic structures","compact metamaterial phase shifters;compact phase shifters;broadband applications;negative refractive index metamaterials;printed transmission lines;lumped element capacitors;lumped element inductors;high-pass configuration;periodic analysis;coplanar waveguide technology;delay lines;linear phase response;group delays;periodic structures;0.9 GHz","","276","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Exponentially stable periodic orbits of the zero dynamics correspond to exponentially stabilizable orbits of the full model. A convenient parameterization of the hybrid zero dynamics is imposed through the choice of a class of output functions. Parameter optimization is used to tune the hybrid zero dynamics in order to achieve closed-loop, exponentially stable walking with low energy consumption, while meeting natural kinematic and dynamic constraints.

Research suggests, however, that the degree and impact of trust, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use change with experience. Using existing, validated scales, this study describes a free-simulation experiment that compares the degree and relative importance of customer trust in an e-vendor vis-a-vis TAM constructs of the website, between potential (i.e., new) customers and repeat (i.e., experienced) ones. The study found that repeat customers trusted the e-vendor more, perceived the website to be more useful and easier to use, and were more inclined to purchase from it. The data also show that while repeat customers' purchase intentions were influenced by both their trust in the e-vendor and their perception that the website was useful, potential customers were not influenced by perceived usefulness, but only by their trust in the e-vendor.

Also, by using four resonators, the bandpass filter has better out-of-band rejection than the conventional cross-coupled microstrip filter.

Proxy servers partially address the need for rapid content delivery by providing multiple clients with a shared cache location. In this context, if a requested object exists in a cache (and the cached version has not expired), clients get a cached copy, which typically reduces delivery time. CDNs act as trusted overlay networks that offer high-performance delivery of common Web objects, static data, and rich multimedia content by distributing content load among servers that are close to the clients.

Such SIW structures can largely preserve the advantages of conventional rectangular waveguides such as high-Q factor and high power capacity. However, they are subject to leakage due to periodic gaps, which potentially results in wave attenuation. Therefore, such a guided-wave modeling problem becomes a very complicated complex eigenvalue problem. Since the SIW are bilaterally unbounded, absorbing boundary conditions should be deployed in numerical algorithms. This often leads to a difficult complex root-extracting problem of a transcend equation. In this paper, we present a novel finite-difference frequency-domain algorithm with a perfectly matched layer and Floquet's theorem for the analysis of SIW guided-wave problems. In this scheme, the problem is converted into a generalized matrix eigenvalue problem and finally transformed to a standard matrix eigenvalue problem that can be solved with efficient subroutines available. This approach has been validated by experiment.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2003.818935","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1242984","","Finite difference methods;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Matrix converters;Transmission line matrix methods;Nonhomogeneous media;Microwave integrated circuits;Ceramics;Printed circuits;Periodic structures;Rectangular waveguides","frequency-domain analysis;finite difference methods;periodic structures;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;substrates;planar waveguides;waveguide theory;matrix algebra;microwave integrated circuits;hybrid integrated circuits;ceramic packaging;printed circuits","finite-difference frequency-domain algorithm;FDFD algorithm;guided-wave properties modeling;substrate integrated waveguide;multilayer microwave integrated circuits;multilayer MIC;periodic metallic via-holes;low-temperature co-fired ceramics;LTCC;multilayered printed circuit boards;multilayered PCBs;waveguide-like structures;high-Q factor;high power capacity;leakage;wave attenuation;guided-wave modeling problem;absorbing boundary conditions;numerical algorithms;perfectly matched layer;PML;Floquet's theorem;generalized matrix eigenvalue problem;standard matrix eigenvalue problem;open periodic structure","","186","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Assuming that the transmitter uses the quantized information for beamforming, we derive a universal lower bound on the outage probability for any finite set of beamformers. The universal lower bound provides a concise characterization of the gain with each additional bit of feedback information regarding the channel. Using the bound, it is shown that finite information systems approach the perfect information case as (t-1)2/sup -B/t-1/, where B is the number of feedback bits and t is the number of transmit antennas. The geometrical bounding technique, used in the proof of the lower bound, also leads to a design criterion for good beamformers, whose outage performance approaches the lower bound. The design criterion minimizes the maximum inner product between any two beamforming vectors in the beamformer codebook, and is equivalent to the problem of designing unitary space-time codes under certain conditions. Finally, we show that good beamformers are good packings of two-dimensional subspaces in a 2t-dimensional real Grassmannian manifold with chordal distance as the metric.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2003.817433","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1237136","","Array signal processing;Feedback;Transmitters;Transmitting antennas;Performance gain;Power control;Antenna feeds;Information systems;Telephone sets;Base stations","adaptive antenna arrays;array signal processing;transmitting antennas;quantisation (signal);feedback;probability;space-time codes","beamforming;finite rate feedback;multiple-antenna systems;transmitter;quantized information;instantaneous channel realizations;universal lower bound;outage probability;feedback information;finite information systems;perfect information;feedback bits;transmit antennas;geometrical bounding technique;design criterion;outage performance;maximum inner product;beamforming vectors;beamformer codebook;unitary space-time codes;real Grassmannian manifold;chordal distance","","677","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The problem of joint allocation is divided into two steps. In the first step, the number of subcarriers that each user gets is determined based on the users' average signal-to-noise ratio. The algorithm is shown to find the distribution of subcarriers that minimizes the total power required when every user experiences a flat-fading channel. In the second stage of the algorithm, it finds the best assignment of subcarriers to users. Two different approaches are presented, the rate-craving greedy algorithm and the amplitude-craving greedy algorithm. A single cell with one base station and many mobile stations is considered.

We design, implement, and evaluate a series of pattern classifiers and compare their performance on an online course dataset. A combination of multiple classifiers leads to a significant improvement in classification performance. Furthermore, by learning an appropriate weighting of the features used via a genetic algorithm (GA), we further improve prediction accuracy. The GA is demonstrated to successfully improve the accuracy of combined classifier performance, about 10 to 12% when comparing to non-GA classifier.

We apply 2-D finite-element method (FEM) simulations to evaluate the accuracy of each method for predicting proximity-effect losses. We find that both methods can have substantial errors, exceeding 60%. The Ferreira method, which is based on the exact Bessel-function solution for the eddy current in an isolated conducting cylinder subjected to a time-varying magnetic field, is found to be most accurate for loosely packed windings, whereas the Dowell method, which approximates winding layers comprising multiple turns of round wire with a rectangular conducting sheet, is most accurate for closely-packed windings. To achieve higher accuracy than is possible with either method alone, we introduce a new formula, based on modifying the Dowell method. Parameters in the new formula are chosen based on fitting our FEM simulation data.

Transducers of varying dimensions were built for an f# range of 2.0-3.1. The desired focal depths were achieved by either casting an acoustic lens on the transducer face or press-focusing the piezoelectric into a spherical curvature. For designs that required electrical impedance matching, a low impedance transmission line coaxial cable was used. All transducers were tested in a pulse-echo arrangement, whereby the center frequency, bandwidth, insertion loss, and focal depth were measured. Several transducers were fabricated with center frequencies in the 20-80 MHz range with the measured -6 dB bandwidths and two-way insertion loss values ranging from 57 to 74% and 9.6 to 21.3 dB, respectively. Both transducer focusing techniques proved successful in producing highly sensitive, high-frequency, single-element, ultrasonic-imaging transducers. In vivo and in vitro ultrasonic backscatter microscope (UBM) images of human eyes were obtained with the 50 MHz transducers.

The authors review the total dose, single-event effects, and dose rate hardness of SOI devices. The total dose response of SOI devices is more complex than for bulk-silicon devices due to the buried oxide. Radiation-induced trapped charge in the buried oxide can increase the leakage current of partially depleted transistors and decrease the threshold voltage and increase the leakage current of fully depleted transistors. Process techniques that reduce the net amount of radiation-induced positive charge trapped in the buried oxide and device design techniques that mitigate the effects of trapped charge in the buried oxide have been developed to harden SOI devices to bulk-silicon device levels. The sensitive volume for charge collection in SOI technologies is much smaller than for bulk-silicon devices potentially making SOI devices much harder to single-event upset (SEU). However, bipolar amplification caused by floating body effects can significantly reduce the SEU hardness of SOI devices. Body ties are used to reduce floating body effects and improve SEU hardness. SOI ICs are completely immune to classic four-layer p-n-p-n single-event latchup; however, floating body effects make SOI ICs susceptible to single-event snapback (single transistor latch). The sensitive volume for dose rate effects is typically two orders of magnitude lower for SOI devices than for bulk-silicon devices. By using body ties to reduce bipolar amplification, much higher dose rate upset levels can be achieved for SOI devices than for bulk-silicon devices.","1558-1578","","10.1109/TNS.2003.812930","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1208574","","Radiation effects;Single event upset;Silicon on insulator technology;Isolation technology;Space technology;Leakage current;Laboratories;Threshold voltage;Immune system;Dielectrics","silicon-on-insulator;radiation hardening (electronics);nuclear electronics;amplification","radiation effects;SOI technologies;silicon-on-insulator;radiation-hardened applications;total dose;single-event effects;dose rate hardness;trapped charge;fully depleted transistors;single-event upset;bipolar amplification;floating body;Si","","257","","93","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Second-order intermodulation products generated by the input transconductor or due to self-mixing usually contribute to determine the IIP2 even though they can, at least in principle, be eliminated. The parasitic capacitance loading the switching-stage common source plays a key role in the intermodulation mechanisms. Moreover, the paper shows that, besides direct conversion and low intermediate frequency (IF), even superheterodyne receivers can suffer from second-order intermodulation if the IF is not carefully chosen.

The hand and wrist control part selects an active joint in the manipulator's end-effector and controls it based on EMG pattern discrimination. The arm control part measures the position of the operator's wrist joint or the amputated part using a three-dimensional position sensor, and the joint angles of the manipulator's arm, except for the end-effector part, are controlled according to this position, which, in turn, corresponds to the position of the manipulator's joint. These control parts enable the operator to control the manipulator intuitively. The distinctive feature of our system is to use a novel statistical neural network for EMG pattern discrimination. The system can adapt itself to changes of the EMG patterns according to the differences among individuals, different locations of the electrodes, and time variation caused by fatigue or sweat. Our experiments have shown that the developed system could learn and estimate the operator's intended motions with a high degree of accuracy using the EMG signals, and that the manipulator could be controlled smoothly.

Proceedings.","","2003","2","","II","II","A new algorithm is proposed for removing large objects from digital images. The challenge is to fill in the hole that is left behind in a visually plausible way. In the past, this problem has been addressed by two classes of algorithms: (i) ""texture synthesis"" algorithms for generating large image regions from sample textures, and (ii) ""inpainting"" techniques for filling in small image gaps. The former work well for ""textures"" - repeating two dimensional patterns with some stochasticity; the latter focus on linear ""structures"" which can be thought of as one dimensional patterns, such as lines and object contours. This paper presents a novel and efficient algorithm that combines the advantages of these two approaches. We first note that exemplar-based texture synthesis contains the essential process required to replicate both texture and structure; the success of structure propagation, however, is highly dependent on the order in which the filling proceeds. We propose a best-first algorithm in which the confidence in the synthesized pixel values is propagated in a manner similar to the propagation of information in inpainting. The actual color values are computed using exemplar-based synthesis. Computational efficiency is achieved by a block-based sampling process. A number of examples on real and synthetic images demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in removing large occluding objects as well as thin scratches. Robustness with respect to the shape of the manually selected target region is also demonstrated. Our results compare favorably to those obtained by existing techniques.","1063-6919","0-7695-1900-8","10.1109/CVPR.2003.1211538","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1211538","","Filling;Image restoration;Digital images;Image generation;Computational efficiency;Image sampling;Robustness;Shape;Humans;Sampling methods","hidden feature removal;object detection;image sampling;spatial data structures;image colour analysis;feature extraction;stochastic processes;block codes","object removal;exemplar-based inpainting;texture synthesis algorithm;image region generation;sample texture;image gap;two dimensional pattern repetition;stochasticity;linear structure;object contour;structure propagation;best-first algorithm;pixel value propagation;color value;block-based sampling;real image;synthetic image;occluding object;thin scratch;manually selected target region","","299","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Contrast enhancement using recursive mean-separate histogram equalization for scalable brightness preservation","Soong-Der Chen; A. R. Ramli","Putra Malaysia Univ., Serdang, Malaysia; Putra Malaysia Univ., Serdang, Malaysia","IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","","2003","49","4","1301","1309","Histogram equalization (HE) is widely used for contrast enhancement. However, it tends to change the brightness of an image and hence, not suitable for consumer electronic products, where preserving the original brightness is essential to avoid annoying artifacts. Bi-histogram equalization (BBHE) has been proposed and analyzed mathematically that it can preserve the original brightness to a certain extend. However, there are still cases that are not handled well by BBHE, as they require higher degree of preservation. This paper proposes a generalization of BBHE referred to as recursive mean-separate histogram equalization (RMSHE) to provide not only better but also scalable brightness preservation. BBHE separates the input image's histogram into two based on its mean before equalizing them independently. While the separation is done only once in BBHE, this paper proposes to perform the separation recursively; separate each new histogram further based on their respective mean. It is analyzed mathematically that the output image's mean brightness will converge to the input image's mean brightness as the number of recursive mean separation increases. Besides, the recursive nature of RMSHE also allows scalable brightness preservation, which is very useful in consumer electronics. Simulation results show that the cases which are not handled well by HE, BBHE and dualistic sub image histogram equalization (DSIHE), have been properly enhanced by RMSHE.","1558-4127","","10.1109/TCE.2003.1261233","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1261233","","Histograms;Brightness;Consumer electronics;Image analysis;Entropy;Image converters;Probability distribution;Dynamic range;Biomedical image processing","image enhancement;brightness","contrast enhancement;recursive mean-separate histogram equalization;scalable brightness preservation;bihistogram equalization;dualistic sub image histogram equalization;recursive mean-separate;digital image;mathematical analysis","","434","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Neural networks can be trained to learn the behavior of passive/active components/circuits. A trained neural network can be used for high-level design, providing fast and accurate answers to the task it has learned. Neural networks are attractive alternatives to conventional methods such as numerical modeling methods, which could be computationally expensive, or analytical methods which could be difficult to obtain for new devices, or empirical modeling solutions whose range and accuracy may be limited. This tutorial describes fundamental concepts in this emerging area aimed at teaching RF/microwave engineers what neural networks are, why they are useful, when they can be used, and how to use them. Neural-network structures and their training methods are described from the RF/microwave designer's perspective. Electromagnetics-based training for passive component models and physics-based training for active device models are illustrated.

Electrode offset potentials can be several orders of magnitude larger than the amplitudes of the biological signals of interest, thus limiting the admissible gain of a dc-coupled front end to prevent amplifier saturation. A high-gain input stage needs ac input coupling. This can be achieved by series capacitors, but in order to provide a bias path, grounded resistors are usually included, which degrade the common mode rejection ratio (CMRR). This paper proposes a novel balanced input ac-coupling network that provides a bias path without any connection to ground, thus resulting in a high CMRR. The circuit being passive, it does not limit the differential dc input voltage. Furthermore, differential signals are ac coupled, whereas common-mode voltages are dc coupled, thus allowing the closed-loop control of the dc common mode voltage by means of a driven-right-leg circuit. This makes the circuit compatible with common-mode dc shifting strategies intended for single-supply biopotential amplifiers. The proposed circuit allows the implementation of high-gain biopotential amplifiers with a reduced number of parts, thus resulting in low power consumption. An electrocardiogram amplifier built according to the proposed design achieves a CMRR of 123 dB at 50 Hz.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2003.808826","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1186743","","Operational amplifiers;Coupling circuits;Resistors;Differential amplifiers;Electrodes;Degradation;Instruments;Filters;Voltage;Energy consumption","bioelectric potentials;electrocardiography;biomedical electrodes;closed loop systems;instrumentation amplifiers;biomedical electronics","biopotential measurements;AC-coupled front-end;electrode offset potentials;biological signals;high-gain input stage;series capacitors;bias path;grounded resistors;common mode rejection ratio;balanced input ac-coupling network;differential dc input voltage;differential signals;dc coupled common-mode voltages;closed-loop control;dc common mode voltage;driven-right-leg circuit;common-mode dc shifting strategies;single-supply biopotential amplifiers;high-gain biopotential amplifiers;low power consumption;electrocardiogram amplifier;design;50 Hz","Amplifiers;Electrocardiography;Electrophysiology;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Quality Control","148","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Next, text regions are identified by applying a continuously adaptive mean shift algorithm (CAMSHIFT) to the results of the texture analysis. The combination of CAMSHIFT and SVMs produces both robust and efficient text detection, as time-consuming texture analyses for less relevant pixels are restricted, leaving only a small part of the input image to be texture-analyzed.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2003.1251157","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1251157","","Support vector machines;Feature extraction;Image texture analysis;Image analysis;Robustness;Pixel;Carbon capture and storage;Indexing;Degradation;Neural networks","image texture;document image processing;text analysis;character recognition;support vector machines;feature extraction;indexing","texture based approach;text detection;support vector machines;continuously adaptive mean shift algorithm;SVM;textural properties;feature extraction;textural pattern;high dimensional spaces;time consuming texture analyses;pixels;input image","","250","","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such mismatches may frequently occur in practical situations because of violation of underlying assumptions on the environment, sources, or sensor array. This is especially true when the desired signal components are present in the beamformer ""training"" data snapshots because in this case, the adaptive array performance is very sensitive to array and model imperfections. The similar phenomenon of performance degradation can occur even when the array response to the desired signal is known exactly, but the training sample size is small. We propose a new powerful approach to robust adaptive beamforming in the presence of unknown arbitrary-type mismatches of the desired signal array response. Our approach is developed for the most general case of an arbitrary dimension of the desired signal subspace and is applicable to both the rank-one (point source) and higher rank (scattered source/fluctuating wavefront) desired signal models. The proposed robust adaptive beamformers are based on explicit modeling of uncertainties in the desired signal array response and data covariance matrix as well as worst-case performance optimization. Simple closed-form solutions to the considered robust adaptive beamforming problems are derived. Our new beamformers have a computational complexity comparable with that of the traditional adaptive beamforming algorithms, while, at the same time, offer a significantly improved robustness and faster convergence rates.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2003.815395","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1223538","","Robustness;Array signal processing;Adaptive arrays;Sensor arrays;Degradation;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Training data;Scattering;Uncertainty;Covariance matrix","array signal processing;covariance matrices;optimisation;convergence of numerical methods;computational complexity","robust adaptive beamforming;adaptive beamforming methods;array responses mismatch;sensor array;desired signal components;beamformer training data snapshots;adaptive array performance;adaptive beamforming performance degradation;training sample size;desired signal array response;desired signal subspace dimension;scattered source/fluctuating wavefront;point source;desired signal models;uncertainties modeling;data covariance matrix;worst-case performance optimization;closed-form solutions;computational complexity;convergence rates;uniform linear array","","323","","46","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the 90's, it was mainly used by healthcare providers, regardless time and location, for second opinion and patient consultation. Today it elaborates solutions for remote health monitoring to support prevention, early diagnosis, disease management, treatment and home rehabilitation. Remote health monitoring could lead to a significant reduction of total cost in healthcare by avoiding unnecessary hospitalisations and ensuring that those who need urgent care get it sooner. Latest developments in micro- and nanotechnologies as well as in information processing and wireless communication offer, today, the possibility for smart miniaturisation and non-invasive biomedical measurement as well as for wearable sensing, processing and communication. Although developing specific systems and applications to address specific user needs, the ""smart health wearable"" research and industrial community faces a number of common critical issues, e.g. biomedical sensors, scenarios of use (linked to the business scenarios), data security and confidentiality, risk analysis, user interface, medical knowledge/decision support, dissemination, user acceptance and awareness, business models and exploitation. Beyond technology, which seems providing proof of concept, real future challenges such as clinical validation and impact assessment of the newly developed smart wearable applications, are ahead.

The applications of high-quality passives for the resonator are introduced: 1) a single-loop horseshoe inductor with Q > 20 between 2 and 5 GHz for good phase noise performance; and 2) accumulation MOS (AMOS) varactors with C/sub max//C/sub min/ ratio of 6 to provide wide-band tuning capability at low-voltage supply. The adverse effect of AMOS varactors due to high sensitivity is examined. Amendment using bandswitching topology is suggested, and a phase noise improvement of 7 dB is measured to prove the concept. The measured VCO operates on a 1-V supply with a wide tuning range of 58.7% between 3.0 and 5.6 GHz when tuned between ±0.7 V. The phase noise is -120 dBc/Hz at 3.0 GHz, and -114.5 dBc/Hz at 5.6 GHz, with the nominal power dissipation between 2 and 3 mW across the whole tuning range. The best phase noise at 1-MHz offset is -124 dBc/Hz at the frequency of 3 GHz, a supply voltage of 1.4 V, and power dissipation of 8.4 mW. When the supply is reduced to 0.83 V, the VCO dissipates less than 1 mW at 5.6 GHz. Using this design methodology, the feasibility of generating two local oscillator frequencies (2.4-GHz ISM and 5-GHz U-NII) for WLAN transceiver using a single VCO with only one monolithic inductor is demonstrated. The VCO is fabricated in a 0.13-μm partially depleted silicon-on-insulator CMOS process.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2003.814440","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1214726","","Wideband;Voltage-controlled oscillators;Wireless LAN;Phase noise;Tuning;Design methodology;Inductors;Varactors;Noise measurement;Phase measurement","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;voltage-controlled oscillators;wireless LAN;phase noise;varactors;circuit tuning;low-power electronics;transceivers;UHF integrated circuits;UHF oscillators","wide-band CMOS VCO;multiband wireless LAN applications;high-quality passives;single-loop horseshoe inductor;phase noise performance;accumulation MOS varactors;wide-band tuning capability;low-voltage supply;band-switching topology;phase noise;nominal power dissipation;supply voltage;power dissipation;local oscillator frequencies;transceiver;CMOS;2 to 5 GHz;1 V;3.0 to 5.6 GHz;2 to 3 mW;0.13 micron","","153","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The paper proposes an overmodulation strategy of space vector PWM of a three-level inverter with linear transfer characteristic that easily extends from the undermodulation strategy previously developed by the authors for neural network implementation. The overmodulation strategy is very complex because of large number of inverter switching states, and hybrid in nature, that incorporates both undermodulation and overmodulation algorithms. The paper describes systematically the algorithm development, system analysis, DSP based implementation, and extensive evaluation study to validate the modulator performance. The modulator takes the command voltage and angle information at the input and generates symmetrical PWM waves for the three phases of an IGBT inverter that operates at 1.0 kHz switching frequency. The switching states are distributed such that the neutral point voltage always remains balanced. An open loop volts/Hz controlled induction motor drive has been evaluated extensively by smoothly varying the voltage and frequency in the whole speed range that covers both undermodulation and overmodulation (nearest to square-wave) regions, and performance was found to be excellent. The PWM algorithm can be easily extended to vector-controlled drive. The algorithm development is again fully compatible for implementation by a neural network.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2003.809342","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1189611","","Space vector pulse width modulation;Pulse width modulation inverters;Voltage;Neural networks;Pulse width modulation;Aerospace industry;Performance analysis;Algorithm design and analysis;Digital signal processing;Phase modulation","PWM invertors;DC-AC power convertors;switching convertors;insulated gate bipolar transistors;power semiconductor switches;power bipolar transistors;bipolar transistor switches;induction motor drives;voltage control;frequency control;machine control","three-level inverter;space vector pulse width modulation;overmodulation region;linear transfer characteristic;inverter switching states;undermodulation algorithms;overmodulation algorithms;symmetrical PWM waves;switching frequency;induction motor drive;voltage regulation;frequency regulation;1.0 kHz","","101","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This not only results in large die size but also in significant degradation of dynamic range for high-frequency signals. To overcome technology barriers, relax requirements on the layout, and reduce DAC sensitivities to process, temperature, and aging, calibration is emerging as a viable solution for the next-generation high-performance DACs. A new foreground calibration technique suitable for very-low-voltage environments is presented which effectively compensates for current source mismatch, and achieves high linearity with small die size and low power consumption. Settling and dynamic performance are also improved due to a dramatic reduction of parasitic effects. To demonstrate this technique, a 14-bit DAC prototype was implemented in a 0.13-μm digital CMOS process. This is the first CMOS DAC reported that operates with a single 1.5-V power supply and achieves 14-bit linearity with less than 0.1 mm2 of active area.

Its excellent mechanical and electrical characteristics attract the high-speed, power management devices and fine-pitch applications. Copper wire bonding can be a potentially alternative interconnection technology along with flip chip interconnection. However, the growth of Cu/Al intermetallic compound (IMC) at the copper wire and aluminum interface can induce a mechanical failure and increase a potential contact resistance. In this study, the copper wire bonded chip samples were annealed at the temperature range from 150/spl deg/C to 300/spl deg/C for 2 to 250 h, respectively. The formation of Cu/Al IMC was observed and the activation energy of Cu/Al IMC growth was obtained from an Arrhenius plot (ln (growth rate) versus 1/T). The obtained activation energy was 26Kcal/mol and the behavior of IMC growth was very sensitive to the annealing temperature. To investigate the effects of IMC formation on the copper wire bondability on Al pad, ball shear tests were performed on annealed samples. For as-bonded samples, ball shear strength ranged from 240-260gf, and ball shear strength changed as a function of annealing times. For annealed samples, fracture mode changed from adhesive failure at Cu/Al interface to IMC layer or Cu wire itself. The IMC growth and the diffusion rate of aluminum and copper were closely related to failure mode changes. Micro-XRD was performed on fractured pads and balls to identify the phases of IMC and their effects on the ball bonding strength. From XRD results, it was confirmed that the major IMC was /spl gamma/-Cu/sub 9/Al/sub 4/ and it provided a strong bondability.","1557-9972","","10.1109/TCAPT.2003.815121","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1218233","","Copper;Intermetallic;Wire;Aluminum;Bonding;Annealing;Costs;Gold;Electric variables;Energy management","copper;aluminium;chemical interdiffusion;lead bonding;annealing;X-ray diffraction;shear strength;contact resistance","intermetallic compound growth;aluminum pad;copper wire bonding;interconnection technology;fracture mode;adhesive failure;contact resistance;mechanical failure;annealing;mechanical characteristics;electrical characteristics;activation energy;Arrhenius plot;ball shear strength;diffusion;ball bonding strength;X-ray diffraction;150 to 300 degC;Cu-Al","","136","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A high-accuracy calibration is achieved by recalculating the digital output based on each stage's equivalent radix. The equivalent radices are extracted in the background by using a digital correlation method. The proposed calibration technique takes advantage of the digital redundancy architecture inherent to most pipelined ADCs.

A rigid body deformation combined with localized cubic B-splines is used to capture this motion. The deformation is defined on a regular grid and is parameterized by potentially several thousand coefficients. Together with a spline-based continuous representation of images and Parzen histogram estimates, our deformation model allows closed-form expressions for the criterion and its gradient. A limited-memory quasi-Newton optimization algorithm is used in a hierarchical multiresolution framework to automatically align the images. To characterize the performance of the method, 27 scans from patients involved in routine lung cancer staging were used in a validation study. The registrations were assessed visually by two expert observers in specific anatomic locations using a split window validation technique. The visually reported errors are in the 0- to 6-mm range and the average computation time is 100 min on a moderate-performance workstation.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2003.809072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1191368","","Image registration;Spline;Positron emission tomography;Mutual information;Protocols;Histograms;Deformable models;Closed-form solution;Image resolution;Lungs","positron emission tomography;computerised tomography;image registration;medical image processing;splines (mathematics);Newton method;image resolution;lung;cancer;image matching","PET-CT image registration;chest;free-form deformations;algorithm;three-dimensional positron emission tomography transmission-to-computed tomography registration;mutual information;similarity criterion;imaging protocols;nonrigid motion;acquisitions;rigid body deformation;localized cubic B-splines;regular grid;spline-based continuous representation;Parzen histogram estimates;closed-form expressions;criterion;gradient;limited-memory quasi-Newton optimization algorithm;hierarchical multiresolution framework;routine lung cancer staging;validation study;expert observers;specific anatomic locations;split window validation technique;visually reported errors;average computation time;moderate-performance workstation;100 min","Algorithms;Artifacts;Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung;Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung;Fluorodeoxyglucose F18;Humans;Lung Neoplasms;Lung Neoplasms;Motion;Radiography, Thoracic;Radiopharmaceuticals;Subtraction Technique;Thorax;Tomography, Emission-Computed","538","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We have observed that when some mobile hosts use a lower bit rate than the others, the performance of all hosts is considerably degraded. Such a situation is a common case in wireless local area networks in which a host far away from an access point is subject to important signal fading and interference. To cope with this problem, the host changes its modulation type, which degrades its bit rate to some lower value. Typically, 802.11b products degrade the bit rate from 11 Mb/s to 5.5, 2, or 1 Mb/s when repeated unsuccessful frame transmissions are detected. In such a case, a host transmitting for example at 1 Mb/s reduces the throughput of all other hosts transmitting at 11 Mb/s to a low value below 1 Mb/s. The basic CSMA/CA channel access method is at the root of this anomaly: it guarantees an equal long term channel access probability to all hosts. When one host captures the channel for a long time because its bit rate is low, it penalizes other hosts that use the higher rate. We analyze the anomaly theoretically by deriving simple expressions for the useful throughput, validate them by means of simulation, and compare with several performance measurements.","0743-166X","0-7803-7752-4","10.1109/INFCOM.2003.1208921","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1208921","","Bit rate;Degradation;Wireless LAN;Performance analysis;Throughput;Fading;Interference;Multiaccess communication;Analytical models;Measurement","carrier sense multiple access;fading;mobile radio;modulation;radiofrequency interference;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11b performance anomaly;wireless local area network;WLAN;mobile host;bit rate;signal fading;signal interference;modulation type;frame transmission;carrier sense multiple access;CSMA/CA channel access method;channel access probability","","666","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These experimental results and 3-D simulations are used to explore the design space for full depletion, as well as layout issues for the Tri-Gate architecture, down to 30 nm gate lengths. It is found not only that the Tri-Gate body dimensions are flexible and relaxed compared to single-gate or double-gate devices, but that the corner plays a fundamental role in determining the device I-V characteristics. The corner device not only turns on at lower voltages due to the proximity of two adjacent gates, but the DIBL of this part of the device is much smaller than the rest of the transistor. The shape of the subthreshold I-V characteristics and the degree of DIBL control, as well as the early device turn-on are also greatly affected by the degree of body corner rounding. Examination of layout issues shows that the fin-doubling approach from using a spacer printing technique results in an increase in drive current of 1.2 times that of a planar device for a given width, though the shape of the allowed Tri-Gate fins has certain restrictions.","","4-89114-033-X","10.1109/VLSIT.2003.1221121","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1221121","","Fabrication;Transistors;Implants;MOS devices;Space technology;Space exploration;Shape control;Boron;CMOS logic circuits;CMOS technology","MOSFET;semiconductor device models","trigate fully depleted CMOS transistors;CMOS transistors fabrication;CMOS transistors design;CMOS transistors layout;3D simulations;trigate body dimensions;double-gate devices;corner device;fin-doubling analysis;spacer printing technique;drive current;planar device;I-V properties;30 nm","","104","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This provides the crucial step in proving the next main result: The diversity order achievable through antenna selection is the same as that of the full system. The result sets up strong motivation for introducing receive selection in MIMO-SM systems.

Emotional intelligence is a facet of human intelligence that has been argued to be indispensable and perhaps the most important for successful interpersonal social interaction. This paper argues that next-generation human-computer interaction (HCI) designs need to include the essence of emotional intelligence - the ability to recognize a user's affective states-in order to become more human-like, more effective, and more efficient. Affective arousal modulates all nonverbal communicative cues (facial expressions, body movements, and vocal and physiological reactions). In a face-to-face interaction, humans detect and interpret those interactive signals of their communicator with little or no effort. Yet design and development of an automated system that accomplishes these tasks is rather difficult. This paper surveys the past work in solving these problems by a computer and provides a set of recommendations for developing the first part of an intelligent multimodal HCI-an automatic personalized analyzer of a user's nonverbal affective feedback.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2003.817122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1230215","","Human computer interaction;Emotion recognition;Face detection;Animation;Anthropometry;Neuroscience;Psychology;Cognitive science;Knowledge based systems;Feedback","emotion recognition;user interfaces","affect-sensitive multimodal human-computer interaction;emotional intelligence;human intelligence;nonverbal communicative cues;face-to-face interaction;interactive signals;intelligent multimodal HCI;automatic personalized analyzer","","410","","126","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The macromodel provides an effective and accurate design tool for this class of MEMS devices. The macromodel is obtained by discretizing the distributed-parameter system using a Galerkin procedure into a finite-degree-of-freedom system consisting of ordinary-differential equations in time. The macromodel accounts for moderately large deflections, dynamic loads, and the coupling between the mechanical and electrical forces. It accounts for linear and nonlinear elastic restoring forces and the nonlinear electric forces generated by the capacitors. A new technique is developed to represent the electric force in the equations of motion. The new approach allows the use of few linear-undamped mode shapes of a microbeam in its straight position as basis functions in a Galerkin procedure. The macromodel is validated by comparing its results with experimental results and finite-element solutions available in the literature. Our approach shows attractive features compared to finite-element softwares used in the literature. It is robust over the whole device operation range up to the instability limit of the device (i.e., pull-in). Moreover, it has low computational cost and allows for an easier understanding of the influence of the various design parameters.

The parameters of this representation are then manipulated to minimize an objective function for segmentation. The resulting algorithm is able to handle multidimensional data, can deal with topological changes of the curve, is robust to noise and initial contour placements, and is computationally efficient. At the same time, it avoids the need for point correspondences during the training phase of the algorithm.

In the case of the synchronous frame current regulator, the time delay is accompanied by a frame rotation. In some applications where the ratio of the sampling frequency to the output frequency is insufficient, such as a high-power drive or a super-high-speed drive, the effect of the frame rotation during the delay time causes a phase and magnitude error in the voltage output. The error degrades the dynamic performance and can cause instability in the current regulator at high speed. It is also intuitively known that advancing the phase of the voltage output can mitigate this instability. In this paper, the errors in the voltage output and the instability problems have been studied analytically and a compensation method for the error is proposed. Using a computer simulation and complex root locus analysis, a comparative study with conventional methods has been carried out and the utility of the proposed method has been verified experimentally.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2003.810660","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1201549","","Pulse width modulation;Delay effects;Regulators;Voltage;Frequency;Computer errors;Arithmetic;Space vector pulse width modulation;Sampling methods;Degradation","machine control;electric current control;digital simulation;compensation;root loci;pulse width modulation;AC motor drives;electric machine analysis computing","compensation method;time delay;full-digital synchronous frame current regulator;PWM AC drives;voltage output;full-digital implementation;current regulator;arithmetic calculation;pulsewidth modulation;synchronous frame current regulator;frame rotation;voltage output magnitude error;voltage output phase error;dynamic performance;instability mitigation;computer simulation;root locus analysis","","146","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our results, based on industry data from software developed in two popular programming languages used in OO development, indicate that, even after controlling for the size of the software, these metrics are significantly associated with defects. In addition, we find that the effects of these metrics on defects vary across the samples from two programming languages-C++ and Java.

No.03CH37515)","","2003","1","","6","10 Vol.1","In this paper, we present two amplifiers designed in CMOS technology and including an auto-zero architecture for very low offset control. The first design is a high precision operational amplifier focusing on the voltage offset. It is a continuous time auto-zero stabilized architecture, that leads to a typical input offset voltage of 2 /spl mu/V-100nV//spl deg/C. The amplifier with its output buffer consumes 5mW at a supply voltage of +/- 2.5V. The gain bandwidth product is 2MHz while the slew rate is respectively -6V/ /spl mu/s and +8.8V/ /spl mu/s on 10pF with 10K/spl Omega/ load. This amplifier is suitable for the control of large dynamic (>10/sup 5/) calibration signal, and for very low DC signal instrumentation. The second design is a current mode charge pulse amplifier based on a second generation positive current conveyor topology (CCII). The bandwidth, the dynamic range and the output impedance have been optimized using an enhanced cascode current mirror. The preamplifier provides two outputs: one for the signal integration, and another going through a current comparator for a digital counting flow. The double hit resolution is less than Ins. An auto-zero compensation has been added to this preamplifier to control its output current offset down to 60nA. The total power dissipation (preamplifier + offset cancelation + comparator) is less than 1mW. This second amplifier has been designed for low power space applications, especially EUSO (Extreme Universe Space Observatory), which use multianode PMT in the configuration of a large gate time (2.5 /spl mu/s) open for charge integration.","1082-3654","0-7803-8257-9","10.1109/NSSMIC.2003.1351987","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1351987","","Low voltage;Pulse amplifiers;Preamplifiers;CMOS technology;Bandwidth;Space charge;Operational amplifiers;Calibration;Instruments;Pulse generation","CMOS integrated circuits;amplifiers","auto-zero stabilized CMOS amplifiers;very low voltage;current offset;auto-zero architecture;high precision operational amplifier;voltage offset;continuous time auto-zero stabilized architecture;slew rate;charge integration;2.5 V;10 pF;10 kohm;60 nA;1 mW;2.5 mus","","12","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The voltage controller output is used to compensate for reduced gain caused by the AC voltage magnitude depressions. The output phase angle and its derivative, the frequency signal, are controlled in two independent control systems in order to enable elimination of frequency and phase error without compromising transient responses.

In the near future, they may start to influence the dynamics of electrical power systems by interacting with conventional generation equipment and with loads. The impact of wind turbines on the dynamics of electrical power systems therefore becomes an important subject, studied by means of power system dynamics simulations. Various types of power system dynamics simulations exist and the approach depends on the aspect of power system dynamic behavior being investigated. In this paper, the focus is on fundamental frequency simulations, also known as electromechanical transient simulations. In this type of simulation, the network is represented as an impedance matrix and only the fundamental frequency component of voltages and currents is taken into account in order to reduce the computation time. This simulation approach is mainly used for voltage and angle stability investigations.

To achieve the required virtual BC, the two short circuits at the end of the resonant slot are replaced by some reactive BC, including inductive or capacitive loadings. The application of these loads is shown to reduce the size of the resonant slot antenna for a given resonant frequency without imposing any stringent condition on the impedance matching of the antenna. A procedure for designing this class of slot antennas for any arbitrary size is presented. The procedure is based on an equivalent circuit model for the antenna and its feed structure. The corresponding equivalent circuit parameters are extracted using a full-wave forward model in conjunction with a genetic algorithm optimizer. These parameters are employed to find a proper matching network so that a perfect match to a 50 /spl Omega/ line is obtained. For a prototype slot antenna with approximate dimensions of 0.05/spl lambda//sub 0//spl times/0.05/spl lambda//sub 0/ the impedance match is obtained, with a fairly high gain of -3dBi, for a very small ground plane (/spl ap/0.20/spl lambda//sub 0/).

"Ad-hoc association-rule mining within the data warehouse","S. Nestorov; N. Jukic","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Chicago Univ., IL, USA; NA","36th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2003. Proceedings of the","","2003","","","10 pp.","","Many organizations often underutilize their existing data warehouses. In this paper, we suggest a way of acquiring more information from corporate data warehouses without the complications and drawbacks of deploying additional software systems. Association-rule mining, which captures co-occurrence patterns within data, has attracted considerable efforts from data warehousing researchers and practitioners alike. Unfortunately, most data mining tools are loosely coupled, at best, with the data warehouse repository. Furthermore, these tools can often find association rules only within the main fact table of the data warehouse (thus ignoring the information-rich dimensions of the star schema) and are not easily applied on non-transaction level data often found in data warehouses. In this paper, we present a new data-mining framework that is tightly integrated with the data warehousing technology. Our framework has several advantages over the use of separate data mining tools. First, the data stays at the data warehouse, and thus the management of security and privacy issues is greatly reduced. Second, we utilize the query processing power of a data warehouse itself, without using a separate data-mining tool. In addition, this framework allows ad-hoc data mining queries over the whole data warehouse, not just over a transformed portion of the data that is required when a standard data-mining tool is used. Finally, this framework also expands the domain of association-rule mining from transaction-level data to aggregated data as well.","","0-7695-1874-5","10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174605","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174605","","Data mining;Data warehouses;Databases;Warehousing;Query processing;Companies;Costs;Computer science;Software systems;Association rules","data warehouses;data mining;security of data;data privacy;query processing","ad-hoc association-rule mining;software systems;data mining tools;data warehouse repository;data security;data privacy;query processing;ad-hoc data mining queries;transaction-level data;aggregated data","","11","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Instead, exploiting only one follower (either a voltage or a current one) in the compensation branch results to be more appropriate. Indeed, not only does it avoid any additional constraint on stage transconductance, but it also overcomes the inherent limitations incurred by voltage and current followers when used to compensate two-stage amplifiers. Post-layout simulations on a CMOS opamp using the parameters of a 0.35-/spl mu/m process are found to be in good agreement with the expected results.","1558-125X","","10.1109/TCSII.2003.811437","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1198363","","Guidelines;Band pass filters;Tuning;Voltage;Frequency;CMOS process;Matched filters;Circuit optimization;Circuits and systems;Solid state circuits","operational amplifiers;CMOS analogue integrated circuits;integrated circuit design;compensation;circuit simulation;poles and zeros","three-stage operational amplifier;reversed nested Miller compensation;design guidelines;CMOS opamp;design equations;loop-gain phase margin;parasitic positive-zero cancellation;voltage follower;current follower;post-layout simulations;frequency compensation;0.35 micron","","84","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Input-output linearization and zero-dynamics control of three-phase AC/DC voltage-source converters","Tzann-Shin Lee","Dept. of Electr. Eng., Nat. Lien-Ho Inst. of Technol., Taiwan, Taiwan","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","","2003","18","1","11","22","Nonlinear differential-geometric techniques are proposed for the design of a feedback controller for three-phase voltage-source pulsewidth modulation (PWM) AC/DC boost converters under a cascade control structure. The input-output linearizability of the system modeled in d-q synchronous reference frames is examined. The results lead to a decoupled d-q current control scheme. For the internal DC-bus voltage dynamics (zero dynamics), by considering the d-axis current command as control input and using a square transform on DC-bus voltage, it is shown that this remaining system contains an input memoryless nonlinearity of conic sector type and satisfies the conditions for a Lur'e plant. This suggests a new outer-loop control strategy to control the square of the DC output voltage, rather than DC output voltage itself, utilizing a simple proportional plus integral (PI) controller cascaded to the d-axis current loop. Since most results do not consider the control of zero dynamics, the strategy for the control of zero dynamics via cascade control structure may provide valuable insight for the design of input-output linearized systems in which zero dynamics contain some desired control variables. The absolute tracking concept for Lur'e plants is introduced to prove the global tracking capability with zero steady-state error of the voltage loop. The controlled PWM AC/DC converter has the features of global stability, fast (exponential) tracking of DC-bus voltage command with zero steady-state error, asymptotic rejection of load disturbance, robustness against parameter uncertainties and decoupled dynamical responses between d and q current loops. Also, measurement of load current is not required. All these features are confirmed via laboratory experiments on a 1.5 kVA PC-based controlled prototype.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2002.807145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1187319","","Voltage control;Analog-digital conversion;Pulse width modulation converters;Control systems;Pulse width modulation;Pi control;Proportional control;Tracking loops;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Steady-state","AC-DC power convertors;PWM power convertors;rectifying circuits;voltage control;control system synthesis;feedback;cascade control;robust control;two-term control;linearisation techniques","three-phase AC/DC voltage-source converters;input-output linearization;zero-dynamics control;nonlinear differential-geometric techniques;feedback controller design;cascade control structure;d-q synchronous reference frames;internal DC-bus voltage dynamics;outer-loop control strategy;proportional plus integral controller;Lur'e plants;global stability;DC-bus voltage command tracking;robustness;decoupled dynamical responses;1.5 kVA","","151","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, it was shown for the case of highway traffic that position-based routing approaches can very well deal with the high mobility of network nodes. However, baseline position-based routing has difficulties to handle two-dimensional scenarios with obstacles (buildings) and voids as it is the case for city scenarios. In this paper we analyze a position-based routing approach that makes use of the navigational systems of vehicles. By means of simulation we compare this approach with non-position-based ad hoc routing strategies (dynamic source routing and ad-hoc on-demand distance vector routing). The simulation makes use of highly realistic vehicle movement patterns derived from Daimler-Chrysler's Videlio traffic simulator. While DSR's performance is limited due to problems with scalability and handling mobility, both AODV and the position-based approach show good performances with the position-based approach outperforming AODV.","","0-7803-7848-2","10.1109/IVS.2003.1212901","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1212901","","Routing;Ad hoc networks;Cities and towns;Vehicle dynamics;Vehicles;Road transportation;Telecommunication traffic;Navigation;Traffic control;Scalability","ad hoc networks;radionavigation;position control;road traffic;vehicle dynamics;traffic engineering computing","routing strategy;vehicular ad hoc networks;city environments;data routing;highway traffic;network mobility;position based routing approaches;navigation;vehicle systems;vehicle movement patterns;Daimler Chrysler's Videlio traffic simulator;scalability;obstacles;radio access networks","","335","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some fundamental properties of the rate region are exhibited and algorithms for determining the optimal weighted rate sum and the optimal covariance matrices for achieving a given rate vector on the boundary of the rate region are presented. These algorithms are then used in a simulation study to determine potential capacity enhancements to a cellular system through known-interference cancellation. We study both the circuit data scenario in which each user requires a constant data rate in every frame and the packet data scenario in which users can be assigned a variable rate in each frame so as to maximize the long-term average throughput. In the case of circuit data, the outage probability as a function of the number of active users served at a given rate is determined through simulations. For the packet data case, long-term average throughputs that can be achieved using the proportionally fair scheduling algorithm are determined.

Knowledge of this response is necessary for computer vision algorithms which depend on scene radiance. One way the response has been determined is by establishing a mapping of intensity values between images taken with different exposures. We call this mapping the intensity mapping function. In this paper, we address two basic questions. What information from a pair of images taken at different exposures is needed to determine the intensity mapping function? Given this function, can the response of the camera and the exposures of the images be determined? We completely determine the ambiguities associated with the recovery of the response and the ratios of the exposures. We show all methods that have been used to recover the response break these ambiguities by making assumptions on the exposures or on the form of the response. We also show when the ratio of exposures can be recovered directly from the intensity mapping, without recovering the response. We show that the intensity mapping between images is determined solely by the intensity histograms of the images. We describe how this allows determination of the intensity mapping between images without registration. This makes it possible to determine the intensity mapping in sequences with some motion of both the camera and objects in the scene.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2003.1240119","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1240119","","Cameras;Layout;Lighting;Histograms;Dynamic range;Statistics;Computer vision;Radiometry;Machine vision","computer vision","response function;illumination;radiometry;comparagram;dynamic range;intensity mapping;histogram specification;comparametric;camera response;camera response function;computer vision","","173","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This scheme simultaneously decreases the bit error rate slightly while substantially reducing the peak magnitude of an OFDM transmit block. Furthermore, there is no loss in data rate and, unlike other methods, no side information is required.

The problem of an infinitesimal electric dipole embedded in a homogeneous DNG medium is treated; its analytical solution shows that this electrically small antenna acts inductively rather than capacitively as it would in free space. It is then shown that a properly designed dipole-DNG shell combination increases the real power radiated by more than an order of magnitude over the corresponding free space case. The reactance of the antenna is shown to have a corresponding decrease. Analysis of the reactive power within this dipole-DNG shell system indicates that the DNG shell acts as a natural matching network for the dipole. An equivalent circuit model is introduced that confirms this explanation. Several cases are presented to illustrate these results. The difficult problem of interpreting the energy stored in this dipole-DNG shell system when the DNG medium is frequency independent and, hence, of calculating the radiation Q is discussed from several points of view.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2003.817561","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1236081","","Dipole antennas;Magnetic materials;Antenna theory;Dielectric materials;Power system modeling;Frequency;Permittivity;Permeability;Dielectric substrates;Circuits","dipole antennas;antenna radiation patterns;impedance matching;equivalent circuits;Q-factor;lumped parameter networks","double negative materials;radiated power;electrically small dipole antenna;infinitesimal electric dipole;homogeneous DNG medium;free space;antenna reactance;lumped element model;reactive power;matching network;equivalent circuit model;dipole-DNG shell system;frequency independent medium;radiation Q;electromagentic fields;electrically small antennas","","276","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a general power flow algorithm for three-phase four-wire radial distribution networks, considering neutral grounding, based on backward-forward technique, is proposed. In this novel use of the technique, both the neutral wire and ground are explicitly represented.

The EED problem is formulated as a nonlinear constrained multiobjective optimization problem. A new strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA) based approach is proposed to handle the EED as a true multiobjective optimization problem with competing and noncommensurable objectives. The proposed approach employs a diversity-preserving mechanism to overcome the premature convergence and search bias problems. A hierarchical clustering algorithm is also imposed to provide the decision maker with a representative and manageable Pareto-optimal set. Moreover, fuzzy set theory is employed to extract the best compromise nondominated solution. Several optimization runs of the proposed approach have been carried out on a standard test system. The results demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach to generate well-distributed Pareto-optimal solutions of the multiobjective EED problem in one single run. The comparison with the classical techniques demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach and confirms its potential to solve the multiobjective EED problem. In addition, the extension of the proposed approach to include more objectives is a straightforward process.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2003.818693","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1245580","","Power generation economics;Environmental economics;Evolutionary computation;Fuel economy;Costs;Pareto optimization;Power system economics;Thermal pollution;Dispatching;Petroleum","power generation economics;power generation dispatch;Pareto optimisation;evolutionary computation;fuzzy set theory","economic power dispatch;environmental power dispatch;multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;environmental/economic power dispatch;nonlinear constrained multiobjective optimization;strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm;diversity-preserving mechanism;premature convergence;search bias problems;hierarchical clustering algorithm;decision maker;Pareto-optimal set;fuzzy set theory;standard test system;well-distributed Pareto-optimal solutions","","459","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The converter can be seen as an alternative to the ZVS-phase-shift full-bridge DC-DC converter for high-voltage applications. The paper proposes a new command strategy, named interleaved phase shift, which allows equalization of the input capacitor voltage, where each capacitor shares one-quarter of the total input voltage. Due to phase-shift modulation, the current is equally shared among main switches, reducing the converter conduction losses, when compared with conventional pulsewidth modulation. Furthermore, the input capacitors voltage oscillations are reduced due to load variations, as well as due to input DC-bus 120 Hz ripple. Just as with a ZVS-phase-shift full-bridge converter, the proposed converter achieves ZVS in a wide load range, as a function of the transformer leakage inductance. The paper describes the analysis, operating principles, and design procedure for the proposed converter. Experimental results from a 1.5 kW prototype converter operating at 100 kHz with isolated 60 V/25 A output are presented to validate the theoretical analysis and to demonstrate the performance of the proposed converter.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2003.818965","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1248265","","Zero voltage switching;DC-DC power converters;Capacitors;Phase modulation;Pulse modulation;Pulse width modulation converters;Frequency conversion;Switches;Switching converters;Pulse transformers","PWM power convertors;DC-DC power convertors;bridge circuits;losses;transformers;magnetic leakage;inductance","isolated interleaved-phase-shift-PWM DC-DC ZVS converter;half-bridge converters;ZVS-phase-shift full-bridge DC-DC converter;high-voltage applications;command strategy;interleaved phase shift;input capacitor voltage;total input voltage;phase-shift modulation;main switches;converter conduction losses reduction;pulsewidth modulation;input capacitors voltage oscillations;input DC-bus ripple;ZVS-phase-shift full-bridge converter;transformer leakage inductance;1.5 kW;100 kHz;60 V;25 A;120 Hz","","52","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The field distributions inside and outside such paired slabs are analyzed, and the Poynting vector distributions in such structures are studied. Using equivalent transmission-line models, we obtain the conditions for the resonance, complete tunneling and transparency, and we justify and explain the field behavior in these resonant paired structures.

Unlike previous work on packet length optimization in other wired and wireless networks, energy efficiency is chosen as the optimization metric. The use of fixed size packets is proposed in light of the limited resources and management costs in sensor networks. The optimal fixed packet size is then determined for a set of radio and channel parameters by maximizing the energy efficiency metric. Further, the effect of error control on packet size optimization and energy efficiency is examined. While retransmission schemes are found to be energy inefficient, it is shown that forward error correction can improve the energy efficiency eventhough it introduces additional parity bits and encoding/decoding energy consumptions. In this regard, binary BCH codes are found to be 15% more energy efficient than the best performing convolutional codes, which have thus far been considered for error control in sensor networks.","","0-7803-7879-2","10.1109/SNPA.2003.1203351","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1203351","","Energy efficiency;Wireless sensor networks;Error correction;Data communication;Resource management;Costs;Forward error correction;Decoding;Energy consumption;Convolutional codes","packet radio networks;optimisation;data communication;sensors;convolutional codes;forward error correction;BCH codes;binary codes;decoding","energy efficiency;packet size optimization;data communication;energy constrained wireless sensor networks;packet length optimization;management costs;radio parameters;channel parameters;energy efficiency metric;error control;retransmission schemes;forward error correction;parity bits;encoding/decoding energy consumption;binary BCH codes;convolutional codes;optimal fixed packet size","","221","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, motors driven by solid-state inverters undergo severe voltage stresses due to rapid switch-on and switch-off of semiconductor switches. Also, induction motors are required to operate in highly corrosive and dusty environments. Requirements such as these have spurred the development of vastly improved insulation material and treatment processes. But cage rotor design has undergone little change. As a result, rotor failures now account for a larger percentage of total induction motor failures. Broken cage bars and bearing deterioration are now the main cause of rotor failures. Moreover, with advances in digital technology over the last years, adequate data processing capability is now available on cost-effective hardware platforms, to monitor motors for a variety of abnormalities on a real time basis in addition to the normal motor protection functions. Such multifunction monitors are now starting to displace the multiplicity of electromechanical devices commonly applied for many years. For such reasons, this paper is devoted to a comparison of signal processing-based techniques for the detection of broken bars and bearing deterioration in induction motors. Features of these techniques which are relevant to fault detection are presented.

This is true even in a first-order DLL and an overdamped second-order DLL. The amount of jitter peaking is shown to trade off with the tracking bandwidth and, therefore, the acquisition time. Techniques to reduce jitter amplification by loop filtering and phase filtering are discussed.

Packet sniffers are basically applications. They are programs used to read packets that travel across the network layer of the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) layer. (Basically, the packets are retrieved from the network layer and the data is interpreted.) Packet sniffers are utilities that can be efficiently used for network administration. At the same time, it can also be used for nefarious activities. However, a user can employ a number of techniques to detect sniffers on the network and protect the data from sniffers.

Because of the potential for interference with other systems it is necessary to attenuate this noise. Ordinarily this is accomplished by using a magnetic choke across the input power lines, resulting in penalties to the overall size and cost of the completed system. In order to lessen the requirement for this magnetic choke, there has been a desire to introduce noise cancellation techniques to the area of EMI. This text introduces a method of canceling the common-mode EMI by using a compensating transformer winding and a capacitor. Compared with other cancellation techniques, it is much simpler and requires no additional transistors and gate-drive circuitry since it merely adds a small copper winding and a small capacitor. By using this technique the size of the EMI filter can be reduced, especially for applications requiring high currents. In this paper, the new method for passive noise cancellation is applied to many popular converter and inverter topologies. The method, results, and ramifications of this technique are presented in order of appearance.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2003.810858","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1198054","","Circuit noise;Noise cancellation;Power electronics;Electromagnetic interference;Inductors;Capacitors;Parasitic capacitance;Diodes;Transformers;Magnetic noise","DC-DC power convertors;electromagnetic interference;interference suppression;inductors;driver circuits;bridge circuits","common-mode noise passive cancellation;power electronic circuits;conducted electromagnetic interference;conducted EMI;common-mode current flow;parasitic capacitance;transistors;diodes;transformers;noise attenuation;magnetic choke;input power lines;gate-drive circuitry;copper winding;capacitor;EMI filter;inverter;half-bridge isolated DC-DC converter;off-line forward converter","","122","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional approaches to modeling semantic similarity compute the semantic distance between definitions within a single ontology. This single ontology is either a domain-independent ontology or the result of the integration of existing ontologies. We present an approach to computing semantic similarity that relaxes the requirement of a single ontology and accounts for differences in the levels of explicitness and formalization of the different ontology specifications. A similarity function determines similar entity classes by using a matching process over synonym sets, semantic neighborhoods, and distinguishing features that are classified into parts, functions, and attributes. Experimental results with different ontologies indicate that the model gives good results when ontologies have complete and detailed representations of entity classes. While the combination of word matching and semantic neighborhood matching is adequate for detecting equivalent entity classes, feature matching allows us to discriminate among similar, but not necessarily equivalent entity classes.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2003.1185844","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1185844","","Ontologies;Information retrieval;Management information systems;Automatic logic units;Computer Society;Database languages;Knowledge management;Cities and towns;Computational modeling","information retrieval;knowledge management;knowledge engineering","similarity measures;information retrieval;information integration;ontology integration;semantic interoperability;semantic matching","","526","","61","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Reducing the run-time complexity of multiobjective EAs: The NSGA-II and other algorithms","M. T. Jensen","EVALife Group, Univ. of Aarhus, Denmark","IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","","2003","7","5","503","515","The last decade has seen a surge of research activity on multiobjective optimization using evolutionary computation and a number of well performing algorithms have been published. The majority of these algorithms use fitness assignment based on Pareto-domination: Nondominated sorting, dominance counting, or identification of the nondominated solutions. The success of these algorithms indicates that this type of fitness is suitable for multiobjective problems, but so far the use of Pareto-based fitness has lead to program run times in O(GMN/sup 2/), where G is the number of generations, M is the number of objectives, and N is the population size. The N/sup 2/ factor should be reduced if possible, since it leads to long processing times for large population sizes. This paper presents a new and efficient algorithm for nondominated sorting, which can speed up the processing time of some multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) substantially. The new algorithm is incorporated into the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and reduces the overall run-time complexity of this algorithm to O(GN log/sup M-1/N), much faster than the O(GMN/sup 2/) complexity published by Deb et al. (2002). Experiments demonstrate that the improved version of the algorithm is indeed much faster than the previous one. The paper also points out that multiobjective EAs using fitness based on dominance counting and identification of nondominated solutions can be improved significantly in terms of running time by using efficient algorithms known from computer science instead of inefficient O(MN/sup 2/) algorithms.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2003.817234","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1237166","","Runtime;Evolutionary computation;Sorting;Computer science;Surges;Genetic algorithms;Data structures;Nearest neighbor searches;Heuristic algorithms;Councils","computational complexity;evolutionary computation;sorting;search problems","run-time complexity;multiobjective EA;NSGA-II;multiobjective optimization;evolutionary computation;fitness assignment;Pareto-domination;nondominated sorting;dominance counting;multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;genetic algorithm;complexity;niching;search space;nearest neighbor identification","","248","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This class of estimators unifies many of the previous estimators, and introduces new ones. We derive, for the first time, the asymptotic variance (AsV) of these estimators and compare them with the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). We then tackle the problem of estimating K from the in-phase and quadrature-phase (I/Q) components of the received signal and illustrate the improvement in performance as compared with the envelope-based estimators. We derive the CRBs for the I/Q data model, which, unlike the envelope CRB, is tractable for correlated samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel estimator that relies on the I/Q components, and derive its AsV even when the channel samples are correlated.

Therefore, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control is used to maximize the output power of the PV array. Many papers have been reported in relation to MPPT. However, the current-power (I-P) curve sometimes shows multilocal maximum points mode under nonuniform insolation conditions. The operating point of the PV system tends to converge to a local maximum output point which is not the real maximal output point on the I-P curve. Some papers have been also reported, trying to avoid this difficulty. However most of those control systems become rather complicated. Then, the two stage MPPT control method is proposed in this paper to realize a relatively simple control system which can track the real maximum power point even under nonuniform insolation conditions. The feasibility of this control concept is confirmed for steady insolation as well as for rapidly changing insolation by simulation study using software PSIM and Lab VIEW.","","0-7803-7989-6","10.1109/PES.2003.1271058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1271058","","Control systems;Photovoltaic systems;Process control;Surface resistance;Power generation;Proportional control;Voltage control;Short circuit currents;Temperature;Solar power generation","photovoltaic power systems;tracking;power system simulation;power system control;photovoltaic cells","photovoltaic array;PV;power density;drooping current-voltage characteristic;maximum power point tracking control;MPPT;current-power curve;nonuniform insolation condition;control system;real maximum power point;software PSIM;Lab VIEW;PV system;multilocal maximum point","","122","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By aligning SRRs with the slots, a high inductive coupling between line and rings is achieved, with the result of a sharp and narrow rejection band in the vicinity of the resonant frequency of the rings. In order to widen the stop band of the filter, several ring pairs tuned at equally spaced frequencies within the desired gap are cascaded. The frequency response measured in the fabricated prototype device exhibits pronounced slopes at either side of the stop band and near 0 dBs insertion loss outside that band. Since SRR dimensions are much smaller than signal wavelength, the proposed filters are extremely compact and can be used to reject frequency parasitics in CPW structures by simply patterning properly tuned SRRs in the back side metal. Additional advantages are easy fabrication and compatibility with MMIC or PCB technology.","1558-1764","","10.1109/LMWC.2003.819964","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1261767","","Coplanar waveguides;Resonator filters;Optical ring resonators;Etching;Resonant frequency;Frequency response;Frequency measurement;Loss measurement;Wavelength measurement;Prototypes","coplanar waveguide components;band-stop filters;waveguide filters;microwave filters;photonic band gap;periodic structures;Q-factor;equivalent circuits;frequency response;resonator filters","compact stop band filter;miniaturized coplanar waveguide filters;multiple tuned split ring resonators;high inductive coupling;sharp narrow rejection band;frequency response;patterning;microwave filters;metamaterials;electromagnetic bandgap structures;periodic transmission media;high quality factor;magnetically coupled resonators;dispersion relation;lumped element equivalent circuit;50 ohm","","178","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This randomly occurring problem is characterized by burned metal and ""worm-like"" arcing marks along the wafer's edge and the conducting wide metal lines around the die periphery. Arcing-induced particles also increase chamber contamination, requiring more maintenance and downtime. With the impact on yield per wafer, minimizing the frequency has become a key selection criterion for dielectric etch systems, especially for 300 mm manufacturing. Wafer arcing is a response to particular wafer surface structure conditions and plasma instability. Most conducive to this problem are dielectric etch process steps with a prior conductive layer beneath, such as pad and via etch. Arcing can be significantly reduced by a combination of cathode design to support better plasma stability, and electrostatic chuck and process kit design to minimize field gradients across the wafer. In addition, equipment operation parameter settings and process recipes can be optimized to reduce wafer arcing frequency. Providing an advanced chamber design has enabled us to achieve superior wafer arcing performance of less than 1 in 20,000 wafers.","","0-7803-7747-8","10.1109/PPID.2003.1200951","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1200951","","Dielectrics;Etching;Plasma applications;Frequency;Plasma stability;Chip scale packaging;Contamination;Manufacturing;Surface structures;Plasma materials processing","integrated circuit manufacture;sputter etching;integrated circuit yield;plasma instability;plasma density;arcs (electric);process control","backend dielectric etch induced wafer arcing mechanism;dielectric etching;plasma damage phenomenon;burned metal arcing marks;wormlike arcing marks;conducting wide metal lines;arcing-induced particles;chamber contamination;yield per wafer;300 mm manufacturing;wafer surface structure conditions;plasma instability;plasma stability;cathode design;electrostatic chuck design;process kit design;field gradient minimization;operation parameter settings;process recipes optimization;wafer arcing frequency;chamber design;300 mm","","5","","3","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Univ., China; Dept. of Comput., Hong Kong Polytech. Univ., China; NA","IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","","2003","7","6","532","545","Classification is an important topic in data mining research. Given a set of data records, each of which belongs to one of a number of predefined classes, the classification problem is concerned with the discovery of classification rules that can allow records with unknown class membership to be correctly classified. Many algorithms have been developed to mine large data sets for classification models and they have been shown to be very effective. However, when it comes to determining the likelihood of each classification made, many of them are not designed with such purpose in mind. For this, they are not readily applicable to such problems as churn prediction. For such an application, the goal is not only to predict whether or not a subscriber would switch from one carrier to another, it is also important that the likelihood of the subscriber's doing so be predicted. The reason for this is that a carrier can then choose to provide a special personalized offer and services to those subscribers who are predicted with higher likelihood to churn. Given its importance, we propose a new data mining algorithm, called data mining by evolutionary learning (DMEL), to handle classification problems of which the accuracy of each predictions made has to be estimated. In performing its tasks, DMEL searches through the possible rule space using an evolutionary approach that has the following characteristics: 1) the evolutionary process begins with the generation of an initial set of first-order rules (i.e., rules with one conjunct/condition) using a probabilistic induction technique and based on these rules, rules of higher order (two or more conjuncts) are obtained iteratively; 2) when identifying interesting rules, an objective interestingness measure is used; 3) the fitness of a chromosome is defined in terms of the probability that the attribute values of a record can be correctly determined using the rules it encodes; and 4) the likelihood of predictions (or classifications) made are estimated so that subscribers can be ranked according to their likelihood to churn. Experiments with different data sets showed that DMEL is able to effectively discover interesting classification rules. In particular, it is able to predict churn accurately under different churn rates when applied to real telecom subscriber data.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2003.819264","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1255389","","Data mining;Decision trees;Classification tree analysis;Gold;Switches;Accuracy;Performance evaluation;Induction generators;Character generation;Biological cells","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;telecommunication services;customer services;customer satisfaction;genetic algorithms","evolutionary data mining algorithm;churn prediction;classification rules discovery;classification models;customer retention;genetic algorithms;data mining by evolutionary learning","","157","","41","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In spite of these studies and many others, the condition under which an IMM estimator is desirable over a single model Kalman filter versus an IMM estimator are quantified here in terms of the target maneuvering index, which is a function of target motion uncertainty, measurement uncertainty, and sensor revisit interval. Using simulation studies, it is shown that above a certain maneuvering index an IMM estimator is preferred over a Kalman filter to track the target motion. These limits should serve as a guideline in choosing the more versatile, but somewhat costlier, IMM estimator over a simpler Kalman filter.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2003.1261143","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1261143","","Target tracking;Filters;Air traffic control;Motion estimation;Bandwidth;Switches;Aircraft;Aerospace control;Measurement uncertainty;Guidelines","Kalman filters;filtering theory;measurement uncertainty;air traffic control;tracking filters;target tracking","Kalman filter;IMM estimator;interacting multiple model;single-target tracking;air traffic control;target maneuvering index;target motion uncertainty;measurement uncertainty;sensor revisit interval;target motion tracking","","70","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The control adjusts the d and q-axis current reference toward the operating point with a reduced field magnitude along the constant torque curve. Moving along the constant torque curve insures proper torque linearity even in the field-weakening region. By combining closed-loop control using the output voltage and feed-forward control with the pre-calculated tables, the proposed strategy can achieve fast dynamic control as well as parameter insensitivity in the field-weakening region.

We provide a definition of a smooth manifold surface from a set of points close to the original surface. The definition is based on local maps from differential geometry, which are approximated by the method of moving least squares (MLS). The computation of points on the surface is local, which results in an out-of-core technique that can handle any point set. We show that the approximation error is bounded and present tools to increase or decrease the density of the points, thus allowing an adjustment of the spacing among the points to control the error. To display the point set surface, we introduce a novel point rendering technique. The idea is to evaluate the local maps according to the image resolution.

Then, based on the derived linear models, a high-performance linear controller with satisfactory performances is designed. The bold feature of the new model is the independence of the controller design from the operating point.

Proceedings of the","","2003","","","10 pp.","","Human-robot interaction (HRI) for mobile robots is still in its infancy. Most user interactions with robots have been limited to tele-operation capabilities where the most common interface provided to the user has been the video feed from the robotic platform and some way of directing the path of the robot. For mobile robots with semiautonomous capabilities, the user is also provided with a means of setting way points. More importantly, most HRI capabilities have been developed by robotics experts for use by robotics experts. As robots increase in capabilities and are able to perform more tasks in an autonomous manner we need to think about the interactions that humans will have with robots and what software architecture and user interface designs can accommodate the human in-the-loop. We also need to design systems that can be used by domain experts but not robotics experts.

By identifying stable properties of appearance, we can weight them more heavily for motion estimation, while less stable properties can be proportionately downweighted. The appearance model involves a mixture of stable image structure, learned over long time courses, along with two-frame motion information and an outlier process. An online EM-algorithm is used to adapt the appearance model parameters over time. An implementation of this approach is developed for an appearance model based on the filter responses from a steerable pyramid. This model is used in a motion-based tracking algorithm to provide robustness in the face of image outliers, such as those caused by occlusions, while adapting to natural changes in appearance such as those due to facial expressions or variations in 3D pose.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2003.1233903","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1233903","","Robustness;Motion estimation;Target tracking;Biological system modeling;Computer Society;Stability;Adaptive optics;Optical filters;Image motion analysis;Image coding","image sequences;computer vision;object recognition;motion estimation","appearance models;motion-based tracking;natural objects;optical flow;tracking;occlusion;adaptive appearance models;image outliers","","633","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this case, the changing electrical properties indicate the successful deposition of heat in the tissue of interest. Other changes in electrical properties may be caused by disease.

Sleep-related breathing disorders also influence the autonomic nervous system and can cause heart rate changes known as cyclical variation. We investigated the effect of sleep stages and sleep apnea on autonomic activity by analyzing heart rate variability (HRV). Since spectral analysis is suited for the identification of cyclical variations and detrended fluctuation analysis can analyze the scaling behavior and detect long-range correlations, we compared the results of both complementary techniques in 14 healthy subjects, 33 patients with moderate, and 31 patients with severe sleep apnea. The spectral parameters VLF, LF, HF, and LF/HF confirmed increasing parasympathetic activity from wakefulness and REM over light sleep to deep sleep, which is reduced in patients with sleep apnea. Discriminance analysis was used on a person and sleep stage basis to determine the best method for the separation of sleep stages and sleep apnea severity. Using spectral parameters 69.7% of the apnea severity assignments and 54.6% of the sleep stage assignments were correct, while using scaling analysis these numbers increased to 74.4% and 85.0%, respectively. We conclude that changes in HRV are better quantified by scaling analysis than by spectral analysis.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2003.817636","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232484","","Spectral analysis;Fluctuations;Heart rate variability;Sleep apnea;Heart rate;Hospitals;Autonomic nervous system;Hafnium;System testing;Diseases","sleep;spectral analysis;pneumodynamics;neurophysiology;medical signal processing;electrocardiography","polysomnography;scaling analysis;sleep apnea;autonomic nervous system;light sleep;deep sleep;sleep-related breathing disorders;cyclical variation;detrended fluctuation analysis;scaling behavior;long-range correlations detection","Adult;Algorithms;Electrocardiography;Heart Rate;Humans;Hypertension;Polysomnography;Reference Values;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Sleep;Sleep Apnea Syndromes;Sleep Apnea Syndromes;Sleep Apnea Syndromes;Sleep Stages;Statistics as Topic","266","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Robust and accurate methods based on the singularity extraction technique are presented to evaluate the impedance matrix elements of the CFIE with these basis and test functions. In computing the impedance matrix elements, including the gradient of the Green's function, we can avoid the logarithmic singularity on the outer testing integral by modifying the integrand.

To reflect this expanded scope, the broader terms ""microfluidics"" and ""lab-on-a-chip"" are now often used in addition to μTAS. Most microfluidics researchers rely on micromachining technologies at least to some extent to produce microflow systems based on interconnected micrometer-dimensioned channels. As members of the microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) community know, however, one can do more with these techniques. It is possible to impart higher levels of functionality by making features in different materials and at different levels within a microfluidic device. Increasingly, researchers have considered how to integrate electrical or electrochemical function into chips for purposes as diverse as heating, temperature sensing, electrochemical detection, and pumping.

Eng., National Central Univ., Chungli, Taiwan; NA","IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","","2003","39","4","1232","1249","Automatic target recognition (ATR) in hyperspectral imagery is a challenging problem due to recent advances of remote sensing instruments which have significantly improved sensor's spectral resolution. As a result, small and subtle targets can be uncovered and extracted from image scenes, which may not be identified by prior knowledge. In particular, when target size is smaller than pixel resolution, target recognition must be carried out at subpixel level. Under such circumstance, traditional spatial-based image processing techniques are generally not applicable and may not perform well if they are applied. The work presented here investigates this issue and develops spectral-based algorithms for automatic spectral target recognition (ASTR) in hyperspectral imagery with no required a priori knowledge, specifically, in reconnaissance and surveillance applications. The proposed ASTR consists of two stage processes, automatic target generation process (ATGP) followed by target classification process (TCP). The ATGP generates a set of targets from image data in an unsupervised manner which will subsequently be classified by the TCP. Depending upon how an initial target is selected in ATGP, two versions of the ASTR can be implemented, referred to as desired target detection and classification algorithm (DTDCA) and automatic target detection and classification algorithm (ATDCA). The former can be used to search for a specific target in unknown scenes while the latter can be used to detect anomalies in blind environments.

It shows 4.6 times larger current drivability than a planar MOSFET. This is due to the vertically stacked multibridge channels. The subthreshold swing of MBCFET is 61 mV/dec, which is almost an ideal value due to the thin body surrounded by gate.

The miniature filter is approximately 3.5 times smaller than the standard filter with a midband insertion loss of 2.9 dB at 21.1 GHz. The MEMS bridges in this design can also be used as varactors to tune the passband. Such a tunable filter was made on a glass substrate (/spl epsiv//sub r/ = 4.6, tan/spl delta/ = 0.006).

First, in the q-composite keys scheme, we trade off the unlikeliness of a large-scale network attack in order to significantly strengthen random key predistribution's strength against smaller-scale attacks. Second, in the multipath-reinforcement scheme, we show how to strengthen the security between any two nodes by leveraging the security of other links.

In this paper the design of an active rectifier that does not need damping whether passive or active is described. This allows obtaining stability without the decrease of the efficiency typical for the passive damping methods or the increase of cost due to more sensors or more complex control algorithms that is typical for the active damping methods. This has been achieved with a careful choice of sensor position and of the passive elements in the LCL-filter. In fact if the current sensors are on the grid side, rather than on the converter side, the current loop is much more near to the stability. Moreover, if the grid side inductance is a fraction of the converter side one, the current loop is again much more near to the stability. Thus, with a proper design the system can be made stable at some switching frequencies even without any damping.","","0-7803-7883-0","10.1109/IAS.2003.1257762","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1257762","","Rectifiers;Damping;Switching frequency;Pulse width modulation converters;Power system harmonics;Voltage control;Inductors;Robust stability;Costs;Inductance","rectifying circuits;filters;digital control;electric current control;robust control;inductance","stable three-phase LCL-filter;active rectifier;grid converters;robustness;stability;high efficiency;passive damping methods;control algorithms;active damping methods;sensor position;current sensors;current loop;grid side inductance;switching frequencies;digital control;AC current control;11 kW","","88","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Its algorithm is based on skin colour detection. One of the problems that this and similar algorithms have to deal with is sensitivity to the illumination conditions under which the input image is captured. Hence illumination sensitivity influences face detection results. One of the aspects from which we can observe illumination influence is the choice of proper colour space. Since some colour spaces are designed to eliminate the influence of illumination (brightness) when describing colour of an object, an idea of using such a colour space for skin-colour detection has been considered and some of the methods have been researched and tested.","","0-7803-7763-X","10.1109/EURCON.2003.1248169","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1248169","","Humans;Skin;Face detection;Lighting;Computer vision;Machine intelligence;Art;Brightness;Object detection;Testing","face recognition;image colour analysis;computer vision;human computer interaction;brightness","human skin color clustering;face detection;computer vision;human functionality;intelligent machines;human-computer interaction;face detection algorithms;skin colour detection;illumination conditions;input image;illumination sensitivity;illumination influence;colour space;brightness;automatic detection;human face;face candidate search;skin colour determination;2D colour space;3D colour space;illumination independence","","144","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The concepts of phase and projected phase spaces are first introduced, which allows us to convert a time-series into a set of vectors in the (projected) phase spaces. Then we interpret novel events in time-series as outliers of the ""normal"" distribution of the converted vectors in the (projected) phase spaces. One-class SVMs are employed as the outlier detectors. In order to obtain robust detection results, a technique to combine intermediate results at different phase spaces is also proposed.

It consists of a linear feedback law and a nonlinear feedback law without any switching element. The linear feedback part is designed to yield a closed-loop system with a small damping ratio for a quick response, while at the same time not exceeding the actuator limits for the desired command input levels. The nonlinear feedback law is used to increase the damping ratio of the closed-loop system as the system output approaches the target reference to reduce the overshoot caused by the linear part. It is shown that the proposed technique is capable of beating the well-known time-optimal control in the asymptotic tracking situations. The application of such a new technique to an actual hard disk drive servo system shows that it outperforms the conventional method by more than 30%.

In response to this situation, the community has stressed the need for objective methods to compare BCI technologies. Suggested improvements have included the development and use of benchmark applications and standard data sets. However, as a young, multidisciplinary research field, the BCI community lacks a common vocabulary. As a result, this deficiency leads to poor intergroup communication, which hinders the development of the desired methods of comparison. One of the principle reasons for the lack of common vocabulary is the absence of a common functional model of a BCI System. This paper proposes a new functional model for BCI System design. The model supports many features that facilitate the comparison of BCI technologies with other BCI and non-BCI user interface technologies. From this model, taxonomy for BCI System design is developed. Together the model and taxonomy are considered a general framework for BCI System design. The representational power of the proposed framework was evaluated by applying it to a set of existing BCI technologies. The framework could effectively describe all of the BCI System designs tested.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2003.810426","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1200910","","Brain computer interfaces;Vocabulary;Power system modeling;Taxonomy;Standards development;Brain modeling;User interfaces;System testing;Electroencephalography","handicapped aids;medical computing;electroencephalography;user interfaces","brain-computer interface design;general framework;common vocabulary;assistive technology;direct-brain interface;poor intergroup communication;taxonomy;objective methods","Algorithms;Brain;Communication Aids for Disabled;Decision Support Techniques;Equipment Failure Analysis;Humans;Prosthesis Design;Technology Assessment, Biomedical;User-Computer Interface","170","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We compared the performance of the different implementations for a variety of pulse formats and systems, including higher order solitons, collisions of soliton pulses, a single-channel periodically stationary dispersion-managed soliton system, and chirped return to zero systems with single and multiple channels. We introduce a globally third-order accurate split-step scheme, in which a bound on the local error is used to select the step size. In many cases, this method is the most efficient when compared with commonly used step-size selection criteria, and it is robust for a wide range of systems providing a system-independent rule for choosing the step sizes. We find that a step-size selection method based on limiting the nonlinear phase rotation of each step is not efficient for many optical-fiber transmission systems, although it works well for solitons. We also tested a method that uses a logarithmic step-size distribution to bound the amount of spurious four-wave mixing. This method is as efficient as other second-order schemes in the single-channel dispersion-managed soliton system, while it is not efficient in other cases including multichannel simulations. We find that in most cases, the simple approach in which the step size is held constant is the least efficient of all the methods. Finally, we implemented a method in which the step size is inversely proportional to the largest group velocity difference between channels. This scheme performs best in multichannel optical communications systems for the values of accuracy typically required in most transmission simulations.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2003.808628","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1190149","","Optimization methods;Nonlinear optics;Optical mixing;Optical solitons;Optical pulses;Differential equations;Nonlinear equations;Chirp;Robustness;Testing","telecommunication channels;optical fibre communication;Schrodinger equation;optimisation;optical solitons;optical fibre dispersion;telecommunication network management;multiwave mixing","optical-fiber communications system modelling;split-step Fourier method optimisation;nonlinear Schrodinger equation;step-size selection criteria;pulse formats;higher order solitons;soliton pulses;single-channel periodically stationary dispersion-managed soliton system;chirped return to zero systems;multiple channels;single channels;globally third-order accurate split-step scheme;local error;system-independent rule;step sizes;nonlinear phase rotation;optical-fiber transmission systems;logarithmic step-size distribution;second-order schemes;spurious four-wave mixing;single-channel dispersion-managed soliton system;multichannel simulations;inversely proportional;group velocity difference","","279","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A major difficulty that prevents application of the vast control literature developed for the serial counterparts to redundantly actuated parallel manipulators is the lack of an efficient dynamical model for real-time control. In this paper, using the Lagrange-D'Alembert formulation, we propose a simple scheme for computing the inverse dynamics of a redundantly actuated parallel manipulator. Based on this approach, four basic control algorithms, a joint-space proportional derivative (PD) control, a PD control in generalized coordinates, an augmented PD control, and a computed-torque control, are formulated. A two-degrees-of-freedom redundantly acutated parallel manipulator designed for a high-speed assembly task is used to verify the simplicity of the proposed approach and to evaulate the performance of the four control algorithms.","1941-014X","","10.1109/TMECH.2003.820006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1255402","","Manipulator dynamics;PD control;Proportional control;Lagrangian functions;Concurrent computing;Algorithm design and analysis;Assembly;Legged locomotion;Equations;Prototypes","manipulator dynamics;PD control;torque control;redundancy","parallel manipulators;redundant actuation;singularities;Cartesian stiffness;homogeneous output forces;Lagrange-D'Alembert formulation;joint space proportional derivative control;augmented PD control;computed torque control;real time control;inverse dynamics;degrees of freedom;high speed assembly task;performance evaluation","","232","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Algebraic soft-decision decoding is achieved by means of converting the probabilistic reliability information into a set of interpolation points, along with their multiplicities. The proposed conversion procedure is shown to be asymptotically optimal for a certain probabilistic model. The resulting soft-decoding algorithm significantly outperforms both the Guruswami-Sudan decoding and the generalized minimum distance (GMD) decoding of Reed-Solomon codes, while maintaining a complexity that is polynomial in the length of the code. Asymptotic analysis for alarge number of interpolation points is presented, leading to a geo- metric characterization of the decoding regions of the proposed algorithm.

Of the world's /spl sim/50 million people with epilepsy, fully 1/3 have seizures that are not controlled by anti-convulsant medication. The field of seizure prediction, in which engineering technologies are used to decode brain signals and search for precursors of impending epileptic seizures, holds great promise to elucidate the dynamical mechanisms underlying the disorder, as well as to enable implantable devices to intervene in time to treat epilepsy. There is currently an explosion of interest in this field in academic centers and medical industry with clinical trials underway to test potential prediction and intervention methodology and devices for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. This invited paper presents an overview of the application of signal processing methodologies based upon the theory of nonlinear dynamics to the problem of seizure prediction. Broader application of these developments to a variety of systems requiring monitoring, forecasting and control is a natural outgrowth of this field.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2003.810705","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1198245","","Epilepsy;Decoding;Explosions;Food industry;Clinical trials;Medical tests;Drugs;Signal processing;Monitoring;Control systems","diseases;electroencephalography;medical signal processing;brain models;prediction theory;nonlinear dynamical systems","epileptic seizure prediction;signal processing methodologies;nonlinear dynamics theory;EEG;epileptic seizure control;epilepsy;brain dynamical disorder;engineering technologies;brain signal decoding;precursors;dynamical mechanisms;implantable devices;monitoring;forecasting","Algorithms;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Epilepsy;Epilepsy;Humans;Seizures;Seizures;Seizures;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","211","","187","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"IEEE Recommended Practice for Determining the Peak Spatial-Average Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) in the Human Head from Wireless Communications Devices: Measurement Techniques","","","IEEE Std 1528-2003","","2003","","","1","120","IEEE Std 1528-2003 specifies protocols and test procedures for the measurement of the peak spatial-average SAR induced inside a simplified model of the head of users of certain handheld radio transceivers. These transceivers are intended to be used for personal wireless communications services, operate in the 300 MHz–3 GHz frequency range, and are intended to be operated while held against the ear. The results obtained by following the protocols specified in this recommended practice represent a conservative estimate of the peak spatial-average SAR induced in the head of a significant majority of persons, subject to measurement and other uncertainties that are defined in this standard. The results are representative of those expected during conditions of normal use of a handheld wireless device. It is not the intent of this recommended practice to provide a result representative of the absolute maximum SAR value possible under every conceivable combination of head size, head shape, handset orientation, and spacing relative to the head. The measurement of SAR induced in the external tissues of the head, e.g., the external ear (pinna), is not addressed in this standard. The following items are described in detail: measurement concepts, measurement techniques, instruments, calibration techniques, simulated-tissue (phantom) models, including homogeneous anatomical models of the human head and simple phantoms for validation of the SAR measurement system, and the limitations of these systems when used for measuring the spatial-peak mass-averaged SAR. Procedures for calibrating electric field (E-field) probes used for SAR measurements and assessing the SAR measurement and system uncertainties are provided in the annexes. This recommended practice is intended primarily for use by engineers and other specialists who are familiar with electromagnetic (EM) theory and measurement techniques.","","978-0-7381-3717-9","10.1109/IEEESTD.2003.94414","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259064","cellular and mobile telephones;dosimetry;handheld wireless transceivers;measurement uncertainty;miniature electric field E-field probes;nonionizing radiation;RFmicrowave exposure assessment;RFmicrowave hazard assessment;SAR measurements;SAR measurement systems","IEEE Standards;Wireless communication;Electromagnetics;Electric variables measurement;Specific absorption rate;Measurement techniques","","","","15","","154","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Standards"

A specific topology is considered for such a ""global synthesis"": in comparison with conventional filter performances, it provides significant improvements in terms of rejection control. The attenuated frequencies are each located apart from the bandpass frequencies and controlled by means of n transmission zeros introduced through original dual-behavior resonators (DBRs). These resonators are based on the association of different parallel open-ended stubs and allow the designer to independently control the in-band and out-of-band responses of the filter. A global synthesis approach is also discussed on a simplified architecture based on stepped impedance stubs, and the experimental results shown clearly validate the proposed concept. This simplification reduces the number of degrees of freedom when designing a DBR, and consequently the two transmission zeros become dependent.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2003.808729","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1191724","","Band pass filters;Resonator filters;Microwave filters;Topology;Filtering theory;Radio frequency;Bandwidth;Costs;Degradation;Planar waveguides","band-pass filters;passive filters;poles and zeros;resonator filters;microwave filters;microstrip filters;linear network synthesis;transmission line theory;microstrip resonators","narrow bandpass filters;perfectly controlled electrical responses;rejection control;transmission zeros;dual-behavior resonators;parallel open-ended stubs;in-band responses;out-of-band responses;global synthesis approach;stepped impedance stubs;microstrip technology;microwave bandpass filter;filter synthesis","","163","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Further, we have established, both by experiment and computer calculation, that the dependence of the failure mechanism on /spl Delta/Tj is completely different between the new tin-silver-based solder and conventional lead-based solder. According to these evaluations, it has become clear that the power cycling lifetime of the new tin-silver-based solder depends on the solder joint at higher than around 110 K, while it depends on the aluminum wire bonds at lower than around 50 K. As a result, higher power cycling capability can be successfully achieved by using this newly developed solder instead of conventional lead-based solder.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2003.810661","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1201532","","Semiconductor device reliability;Insulated gate bipolar transistors;Failure analysis;Lead;Fatigue;Application software;Mechanical factors;Soldering;Aluminum;Wire","insulated gate bipolar transistors;modules;power bipolar transistors;semiconductor device reliability;soldering;tin alloys;silver alloys;mechanical properties;wetting","power cycling;IGBT power semiconductor modules;reliability;failure mechanism;lead-based solder;joint failure;solder fatigue;tin-silver-based solder;mechanical properties;wettability;computer calculation;aluminum wire bonds","","102","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Information-theoretic analysis of information hiding","P. Moulin; J. A. O'Sullivan","Beckman Inst., Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","","2003","49","3","563","593","An information-theoretic analysis of information hiding is presented, forming the theoretical basis for design of information-hiding systems. Information hiding is an emerging research area which encompasses applications such as copyright protection for digital media, watermarking, fingerprinting, steganography, and data embedding. In these applications, information is hidden within a host data set and is to be reliably communicated to a receiver. The host data set is intentionally corrupted, but in a covert way, designed to be imperceptible to a casual analysis. Next, an attacker may seek to destroy this hidden information, and for this purpose, introduce additional distortion to the data set. Side information (in the form of cryptographic keys and/or information about the host signal) may be available to the information hider and to the decoder. We formalize these notions and evaluate the hiding capacity, which upper-bounds the rates of reliable transmission and quantifies the fundamental tradeoff between three quantities: the achievable information-hiding rates and the allowed distortion levels for the information hider and the attacker. The hiding capacity is the value of a game between the information hider and the attacker. The optimal attack strategy is the solution of a particular rate-distortion problem, and the optimal hiding strategy is the solution to a channel-coding problem. The hiding capacity is derived by extending the Gel'fand-Pinsker (1980) theory of communication with side information at the encoder. The extensions include the presence of distortion constraints, side information at the decoder, and unknown communication channel.

"BLDC motor stator and rotor iron losses and thermal behavior based on lumped schemes and 3-D FEM analysis","A. Cassat; C. Espanet; N. Wavre","EPFL-STI-IPR-LAI, Ecole Polytechnique Fed. de Lausanne, Switzerland; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","","2003","39","5","1314","1322","Many industrial applications refer to brushless DC (BLDC) motors applied at their thermal limits. Two cases related to the motor configuration lead to high possible iron losses and, consequently, to the necessary knowledge of the thermal behavior of the motor. Referring to the motor synchronous frequency: the first case corresponds to a relative low speed, but a high number of pole pairs (torque motors used in direct drive applications); the second case to a low number of pole pairs, but a high speed (mass storage applications, for example). The iron losses are a key issue since the considered frequencies are over the usual range of the known field of magnetic material vendor characteristics. Because the excitation flux and the slot geometry introduce high harmonic frequencies, rotor losses are a key issue of the investigation. This paper considers a torque motor with a high number of slots and high number of poles. The authors present two different methods to model the iron losses and the thermal behavior. The first method uses two lumped schemes: the first scheme permits us to determine the flux distribution as well as the stator, magnet, and rotor yoke iron losses. The temperature gradient distribution is computed using an original lumped thermal scheme of the motor. The second method uses finite-element method (FEM) analysis with a two-dimensional model for the magnetic behavior and a three-dimensional (3-D) model for the thermal behavior. A testing bench for a BLDC torque motor has permitted us to measure the iron losses at no-load generating operation and the temperature using thermal probes and infrared camera. Then, simulations and measurements results are compared to characterize the accuracy of the two methods. The two main interests of the presented work consist of: (1) the computation of the whole iron losses in the stator as well as in the rotor yoke and the magnets; and (2) the comparison of the thermal behaviors obtained with a thermal lumped scheme and 3-D FEM simulations.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2003.816480","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1233591","","Brushless DC motors;Stators;Rotors;Iron;Synchronous motors;Frequency;Magnetic flux;Torque;Computational modeling;DC motors","brushless DC motors;rotors;loss measurement;magnetic leakage;thermal analysis;finite element analysis;machine theory;stators;magnetic flux","BLDC motor;rotor iron losses;stator iron losses;thermal behavior;lumped schemes;3-D FEM analysis;brushless DC motors;iron losses;motor synchronous frequency;pole pairs;torque motors;direct drive applications;magnetic material vendor characteristics;excitation flux;slot geometry;high harmonic frequencies;rotor losses;torque motor;flux distribution;stator losses;magnet losses;rotor yoke iron losses;temperature gradient distribution;lumped thermal scheme;finite-element method;two-dimensional mode;magnetic behavior;testing bench;BLDC torque motor;iron losses measurement;no-load generating operation;thermal probes;infrared camera","","41","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To avoid this, the DSTATCOM is connected in parallel with a filter capacitor that allows the high frequency component of the current to pass. However, this generates control issues in tracking, as standard controls such as a hysteresis control are not suitable in these circumstances. This paper proposes a new switching control scheme and demonstrates its suitability for this problem.

The focus is on the case where there is no channel state information at the transmitter, but channel state information is assumed at the receiver. It is shown that the optimum signaling is sometimes different from cases where the users do not interfere with each other. In particular, the optimum signaling will sometimes put all power into a single transmitting antenna, rather than divide power equally between independent streams from the different antennas. If the interference is either sufficiently weak or sufficiently strong, we show that either the optimum interference-free approach, which puts equal power into each antenna, or the approach that puts all power into a single antenna is optimum and we show how to find the regions where each approach is best.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2003.810345","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1203164","","MIMO;Channel state information;Transmitters;Interchannel interference;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Covariance matrix;Rayleigh channels;Fading;Antenna arrays","MIMO systems;antenna arrays;radiofrequency interference;antenna theory;telecommunication signalling;Rayleigh channels","MIMO capacity;interference;system capacity;interfering users;single-user detection;multiple transmit antennas;receive antennas;flat Rayleigh-fading channels;fading coefficients;channel state information;optimum signaling;space-time coding","","299","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Sci., New Jersey Inst. of Technol., Newark, NJ, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","","2003","14","4","919","928","We present an independent Gabor features (IGFs) method and its application to face recognition. The novelty of the IGF method comes from 1) the derivation of independent Gabor features in the feature extraction stage and 2) the development of an IGF features-based probabilistic reasoning model (PRM) classification method in the pattern recognition stage. In particular, the IGF method first derives a Gabor feature vector from a set of downsampled Gabor wavelet representations of face images, then reduces the dimensionality of the vector by means of principal component analysis, and finally defines the independent Gabor features based on the independent component analysis (ICA). The independence property of these Gabor features facilitates the application of the PRM method for classification. The rationale behind integrating the Gabor wavelets and the ICA is twofold. On the one hand, the Gabor transformed face images exhibit strong characteristics of spatial locality, scale, and orientation selectivity. These images can, thus, produce salient local features that are most suitable for face recognition. On the other hand, ICA would further reduce redundancy and represent independent features explicitly. These independent features are most useful for subsequent pattern discrimination and associative recall. Experiments on face recognition using the FacE REcognition Technology (FERET) and the ORL datasets, where the images vary in illumination, expression, pose, and scale, show the feasibility of the IGF method. In particular, the IGF method achieves 98.5% correct face recognition accuracy when using 180 features for the FERET dataset, and 100% accuracy for the ORL dataset using 88 features.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2003.813829","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1215407","","Independent component analysis;Face recognition;Face detection;Principal component analysis;Wavelet analysis;Lighting;Image recognition;Computer science;Feature extraction;Pattern recognition","independent component analysis;face recognition;feature extraction;inference mechanisms;uncertainty handling;computer vision;image classification;wavelet transforms;visual databases","independent component analysis;face recognition;feature extraction;probabilistic reasoning model;classification;pattern recognition;IGF method;Gabor wavelet representations;principal component analysis;independence property;spatial locality;redundancy;associative recall;experiments;Face Recognition Technology system;FERET;ORL datasets;illumination;independent Gabor features","","275","","52","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The developed IC can generate accurate commutation signals for BLDCMs by using a modified back-EMF sensing scheme instead of using Hall-effect sensors. This IC can be also easily interfaced with a microcontroller or a digital signal processor (DSP) to complete the closed-loop control of a BLDCM. The developed sensorless commutation IC consists of an analog back-EMF processing circuit and a programmable digital commutation control circuit. Since the commutation control is very critical for BLDCM control, the proposed sensorless commutation IC provides a phase compensation circuit to compensate phase error due to low-pass filtering, noise, and nonideal effects of back-EMFs. By using mixed-mode IC design methodology, this IC solution requires less analog compensation circuits compared to other commercially available motor control ICs. Therefore, high maintainability and flexibility can be both achieved. The proposed sensorless commutation IC is integrated in a standard 0.35-/spl mu/m single-poly four-metal CMOS process, and the realization technique of this mixed-mode IC has been given. The proposed control scheme and developed realization techniques provide illustrative engineering procedures for the system-on-a-chip solution for advanced digital motor control.

However, most CFB boilers in China usually burn hard coals such as anthracite and bituml nous coal and coal wastes, so the carbon content in the fly ash from these boilers is higher than expected. This paper investigates the source of unburned carbon in the fly ash of CFB boilers burning hard coal through a series of field tests and laboratory investigations. The char behavior during combustion, including fragmentation and de activation, which is related to the parent coal, has an important impact on the carbon burnout in CFB boilers. The research shows that char deactivation occurs during char burnout in fluidized bed combustion, especially for large particles of low rank coal. The uneven mixing of solids and air in the core region of the furnace also causes poor burnout of carbon in CFB fly ash. An index describing the volatile content (as dry ash free basis) over the heating value is proposed to present the coal rank. The coal combustion efficiency is shown to be strongly connected with this coal index. Several changes in the CFB boiler design are suggested to reduce the unburned carbon loss in the fly ash.","1007-0214","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6073228","Circulating fluidiled bed (cfb);unburned carbon iass;uneven mixing;coal index","Boilers;Coal;Fly ash;Carbon;Furnaces;Combustion","","","","1","","15","","","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

In this paper, we introduce the wormhole attack, a severe attack in ad hoc networks that is particularly challenging to defend against. The wormhole attack is possible even if the attacker has not compromised any hosts, and even if all communication provides authenticity and confidentiality. In the wormhole attack, an attacker records packets (or bits) at one location in the network, tunnels them (possibly selectively) to another location, and retransmits them there into the network. The wormhole attack can form a serious threat in wireless networks, especially against many ad hoc network routing protocols and location-based wireless security systems. For example, most existing ad hoc network routing protocols, without some mechanism to defend against the wormhole attack, would be unable to find routes longer than one or two hops, severely disrupting communication. We present a new, general mechanism, called packet leashes, for detecting and thus defending against wormhole attacks, and we present a specific protocol, called TIK, that implements leashes.","0743-166X","0-7803-7752-4","10.1109/INFCOM.2003.1209219","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1209219","","Intelligent networks;Wireless networks;Ad hoc networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Communication system security;Mobile communication;NASA;Military communication;Business communication","ad hoc networks;telecommunication security;routing protocols;mobile radio","packet leashes;wormhole attacks;wireless networks;mobile ad hoc network;routing protocols;location-based wireless security systems;TIK protocol","","596","","44","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Inst. of Technol. in Zurich, Switzerland","IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","","2003","49","10","2426","2467","A technique is proposed for the derivation of upper bounds on channel capacity. It is based on a dual expression for channel capacity where the maximization (of mutual information) over distributions on the channel input alphabet is replaced with a minimization (of average relative entropy) over distributions on the channel output alphabet. We also propose a technique for the analysis of the asymptotic capacity of cost-constrained channels. The technique is based on the observation that under fairly mild conditions capacity achieving input distributions ""escape to infinity."" The above techniques are applied to multiple-antenna flat-fading channels with memory where the realization of the fading process is unknown at the transmitter and unknown (or only partially known) at the receiver. It is demonstrated that, for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the capacity of such channels typically grows only double-logarithmically in the SNR. To better understand this phenomenon and the rates at which it occurs, we introduce the fading number as the second-order term in the high-SNR asymptotic expansion of capacity, and derive estimates on its value for various systems. It is suggested that at rates that are significantly higher than the fading number, communication becomes extremely power inefficient, thus posing a practical limit on practically achievable rates. Upper and lower bounds on the fading number are also presented. For single-input-single-output (SISO) systems the bounds coincide, thus yielding a complete characterization of the fading number for general stationary and ergodic fading processes. We also demonstrate that for memoryless multiple-input single-output (MISO) channels, the fading number is achievable using beam-forming, and we derive an expression for the optimal beam direction. This direction depends on the fading law and is, in general, not the direction that maximizes the SNR on the induced SISO channel. Using a new closed-form expression for the expectation of the logarithm of a noncentral chi-square distributed random variable we provide some closed-form expressions for the fading number of some systems with Gaussian fading, including SISO systems with circularly symmetric stationary and ergodic Gaussian fading. The fading number of the latter is determined by the fading mean, fading variance, and the mean squared error in predicting the present fading from its past; it is not directly related to the Doppler spread. For the Rayleigh, Ricean, and multiple-antenna Rayleigh-fading channels we also present firm (nonasymptotic) upper and lower bounds on channel capacity. These bounds are asymptotically tight in the sense that their difference from capacity approaches zero at high SNR, and their ratio to capacity approaches one at low SNR.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2003.817449","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1237131","","Fading;Rayleigh channels;Channel capacity;Closed-form solution;Upper bound;Mutual information;Entropy;H infinity control;Transmitters;Signal to noise ratio","Rayleigh channels;Rician channels;channel capacity;antenna arrays;antenna theory;MIMO systems","capacity bounds;duality;multiple-antenna systems;flat-fading channels;channel capacity;dual expression;asymptotic capacity;cost-constrained channels;signal-to-noise ratio;second-order term;single-input-single-output channel;SISO systems;stationary fading processes;ergodic fading processes;memoryless multiple-input single-output channels;MISO channels;beamforming;beam direction;closed-form expression;noncentral chi-square distributed random variable;circularly symmetric stationary;circularly symmetric stationary fading;ergodic Gaussian fading;fading mean;fading variance;mean squared error;Rayleigh channels;Ricean channels;upper bounds;lower bounds","","264","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We assume that the glucose content in dermis tissue traces the variations in blood glucose.

Thus, we have developed a method for the selective measurement of dermis tissue spectra, enabling us to obtain better quality spectra for an accurate blood glucose assay. The selective measurement of the dermis spectra realized by using a newly developed fiber-optic probe that consists of source and detector optical fibers separated by 0.65 mm on a skin surface. The light path in the skin tissue for this geometry has been simulated by a Monte Carlo method. The simulation results show that detected light mainly interrogates dermis tissue. As the absorbance signal of glucose in human tissue is extremely small, the quality of the measured spectra is critical for the reliable assay. The present method for blood glucose assay has been applied to one Type 1 diabetic.

With the other stabilization method, sensors are mounted on the gimbal base, which alleviates some issues with the direct approach but may be less efficient, since disturbances are not measured in the LOS coordinate frame. This paper investigates the impact of LOS disturbances and sensor noise on the performance of each stabilization control loop configuration.

Continuous probabilistic image modeling based on mixtures of Gaussians together with KL measure for image similarity, can be used for image retrieval tasks with remarkable performance. The efficiency and the performance of the KL approximation methods proposed are demonstrated on both simulated data and real image data sets.

Since elimination of the insignificant and/or useless inputs leads to a simplification of the problem, faster and more accurate detection may result. Feature ranking and selection, therefore, is an important issue in intrusion detection. We apply the technique of deleting one feature at a time to perform experiments on SVMs and neural networks to rank the importance of input features for the DARPA collected intrusion data. Important features for each of the 5 classes of intrusion patterns in the DARPA data are identified. It is shown that SVM-based and neural network based IDSs using a reduced number of features can deliver enhanced or comparable performance.

The model is based on the separation of the loss contributions due to hysteresis, eddy currents, and excess losses with the two supplies. Since any contribution depends on the voltage supply characteristics, it is possible to find a direct mathematical relationship between the iron loss contribution and the voltage supply characteristics. As a consequence, an iron loss prediction can be obtained with any voltage supply if it does not produce a hysteresis minor loop. The energetic model is based on coefficients that depend on the magnetic material characteristic. We performed an accurate analysis of the model on eight magnetic materials used for electrical machine construction, of different thicknesses and alloy compositions. In this way, we found the main coefficients for a large spread of magnetic materials. As a consequence, our approach can be a useful support for electrical machine designers when the energetic performance of a magnetic material has to be predicted for a voltage supply different from the sinusoidal one.","1941-0069","","10.1109/TMAG.2003.808599","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1190059","","Iron;Magnetic losses;Soft magnetic materials;Voltage;Magnetic materials;Magnetic hysteresis;Space vector pulse width modulation;Magnetic modulators;Pulse modulation;Eddy currents","soft magnetic materials;eddy current losses;magnetic hysteresis","iron loss;soft magnetic material;voltage supply;sinusoidal modulation;pulsewidth modulation;hysteresis loss;eddy current loss;excess loss;electrical machine design","","194","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is proven that systems using EGT with any of these combining schemes achieve full diversity order when transmitting over a memoryless, flat-fading Rayleigh matrix channel with independent entries. Since, in practice, full channel knowledge at the transmitter is difficult to realize, a quantized version of EGT is proposed.

Dept., DENSO Corp., Aichi, Japan; NA","IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","","2003","38","1","120","125","A compact, high-resolution analog-to-digital converter (ADC) especially for sensors is presented. The basic structure is a completely digital circuit including a ring-delay-line with delay units (DUs), along with a frequency counter, latch, and encoder. The operating principles are: (1) the delay time of the DU is modulated by the analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion voltage and (2) the delay pulse passes through a number of DUs within a sampling (= integration) time and the number of DUs through which the delay pulse passes is output as conversion data. Compact size and high resolution were realized with an ADC having a circuit area of 0.45 mm2 (0.8-μm CMOS) and a resolution of 12 μV (10 kS/s). Its nonlinearity is ±0.1% FS per 200-mV span (1.8-2.0 V), for 14-b resolution. Sample holds are unnecessary and a low-pass filter function removes high-frequency noise simultaneously with A/D conversion. Thus, the combination of this ADC and a digital filter that follows can eliminate an analog prefilter to prevent the aliasing before A/D conversion. Also, both this ADC can be shrunk and operated at low voltages, so it is an ideal means to lower the cost and power consumption. Drift errors can be easily compensated for by digital processing.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2002.806263","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1158789","","Analog-digital conversion;Delay effects;Pulse modulation;Filtering;Digital circuits;Frequency;Counting circuits;Latches;Voltage;Sampling methods","CMOS digital integrated circuits;low-power electronics;digital filters;error compensation;analogue-digital conversion;sensors","all-digital ADC;analog-to-digital converter;digital A/D converter;moving-average filtering;compact high-resolution ADC;sensors;digital IC;ring-delay-line;delay units;frequency counter;latch;encoder;CMOS IC;low-pass filter function;digital filter;low voltage operation;drift error compensation;sensor interface;0.8 micron;12 muV;14 bit","","100","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Knorr et al., (2000)]. We propose a new method for evaluating outlierness, which we call the local correlation integral (LOCI). As with the best previous methods, LOCI is highly effective for detecting outliers and groups of outliers (a.k.a. micro-clusters). In addition, it offers the following advantages and novelties: (a) It provides an automatic, data-dictated cutoff to determine whether a point is an outlier-in contrast, previous methods force users to pick cut-offs, without any hints as to what cut-off value is best for a given dataset. (b) It can provide a LOCI plot for each point; this plot summarizes a wealth of information about the data in the vicinity of the point, determining clusters, micro-clusters, their diameters and their inter-cluster distances. None of the existing outlier-detection methods can match this feature, because they output only a single number for each point: its outlierness score, (c) Our LOCI method can be computed as quickly as the best previous methods, (d) Moreover, LOCI leads to a practically linear approximate method, aLOCI (for approximate LOCI), which provides fast highly-accurate outlier detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use approximate computations to speed up outlier detection. Experiments on synthetic and real world data sets show that LOCI and aLOCI can automatically detect outliers and micro-clusters, without user-required cut-offs, and that they quickly spot both expected and unexpected outliers.","","0-7803-7665-X","10.1109/ICDE.2003.1260802","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1260802","","Data engineering","data mining;correlation theory;statistical analysis;approximation theory;very large databases","outlier detection;data mining;local correlation integral;LOCI;micro-cluster;inter-cluster distance;linear approximate method;approximate LOCI;aLOCI;synthetic data set;real world data set","","242","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, we examine human head and hand orientation motion signals, represented with quaternions, which are critical for correct viewing perspectives in virtual reality. Our experimental results and analysis indicate that unscented Kalman filtering performs equivalently with extended Kalman filtering.

WSNs will also play a key role in pervasive computing where computing devices and people are connected to the Internet. Until now, WSNs and their applications have been developed without considering a management solution. This is a critical problem since networks comprising tens of thousands of nodes are expected to be used in some of the applications above. This article proposes the MANNA management architecture for WSNs. In particular, it presents the functional, information, and physical management architectures that take into account specific characteristics of this type of network. Some of them are restrict physical resources such as energy and computing power, frequent reconfiguration and adaptation, and faults caused by nodes unavailable. The MANNA architecture considers three management dimensions: functional areas, management levels, and WSN functionalities. These dimensions are specified to the management of a WSN and are the basis for a list of management functions. The article also proposes WSN models to guide the management activities and the use of correlation in the WSN management.

It involves the application of a proper sequence of voltage pulses to the stator windings, and the measurement of the peak values of the resulting current in order to achieve the rotor position estimation. Actually, the current measurements show significant uncertainties which affect the rotor position detection. In order to avoid these problems, the authors propose a novel procedure which combines an iterative sequence of voltage pulses with a fuzzy logic processing of the current responses and phase currents derivation based on the DC-link current measurements. The proposed method has been implemented on a /spl mu/C digital signal processor (TMS320F240). The obtained results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

It is therefore important to analyze the capacities of such systems in realistic situations, which may include spatially correlated channels and correlated noise, as well as correlated interferers with known channel at the receiver. Here, we present an approach that provides analytic expressions for the statistics, i.e., the moments of the distribution, of the mutual information of multiple-antenna systems with arbitrary correlations, interferers, and noise. We assume that the channels of the signal and the interference are Gaussian with arbitrary covariance. Although this method is valid formally for large antenna numbers, it produces extremely accurate results even for arrays with as few as two or three antennas. We also develop a method to analytically optimize over the input signal covariance, which enables us to calculate analytic capacities when the transmitter has knowledge of the statistics of the channel (i.e., the channel covariance). In many cases of interest, this capacity is very close to the full closed-loop capacity, in which the transmitter has instantaneous channel knowledge. We apply this analytic approach to a number of examples and we compare our results with simulations to establish the validity of this approach. This method provides a simple tool to analyze the statistics of throughput for arrays of any size. The emphasis of this paper is on elucidating the novel mathematical methods used.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2003.817427","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1237135","","MIMO;Channel capacity;Statistical analysis;Throughput;Signal analysis;Transmitters;Wireless communication;Information analysis;Statistical distributions;Mutual information","antenna arrays;receiving antennas;transmitting antennas;Gaussian channels;channel capacity;radiofrequency interference;noise;correlation methods;covariance analysis;MIMO systems","MIMO capacity;correlated channels;correlated interferers;correlated noise;multiple-antenna arrays;transmitting antenna;receiving antenna;statistics;distribution moments;multiple-antenna systems;Gaussian channels;Gaussian interference;covariance;input signal covariance;channel statistics;channel covariance;closed-loop capacity;transmitter;simulations;throughput;array size;mathematical methods","","232","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this case, the distribution capital investment deferral credit received by the IPP will be dependent on the incremental system reliability improvement rendered by the DG solution.

However, inaccurate modeling of flexure hinges deteriorates the positioning accuracy. In this paper, a planar 3-DOF parallel-type micropositioning mechanism is designed with the intention of accurate flexure hinge modeling. For this, a preliminary kinematic analysis that includes inverse kinematics, internal kinematics, and analytic stiffness modeling referenced to the task coordinate is presented. First, the revolute type of 1-DOF flexure hinge is considered. The simulation result based on the finite element method, however, is not coincident to the analytic result. This is due to the minor axial elongation along the link direction that keeps the mechanism from precise positioning. To cope with this problem, a 2-DOF flexure hinge model that includes this additional motion degree as a prismatic joint is employed in part, and additional actuators are added to compensate for the motion of this new model. On the basis of this model, the positional accuracy is ensured. The effectiveness of this accurate model is shown through both simulation and experimentation. This paper emphasizes that the precise modeling of a flexure hinge is significant to guarantee the positional accuracy of parallel micromechanisms using flexure hinge.","2374-958X","","10.1109/TRA.2003.814511","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1220712","","Fasteners;Kinematics;Actuators;Scanning electron microscopy;Analytical models;Finite element methods;Numerical analysis;X-ray lithography;Micromachining;Research and development","micromanipulators;manipulator kinematics;finite element analysis;motion compensation;actuators","3-DOF parallel micromechanism;flexure hinges;inverse kinematics;internal kinematics;analytic stiffness modeling;task coordinate;1-DOF flexure hinge;finite element method;FEA;FEM;minor axial elongation;2-DOF flexure hinge model;prismatic joint;actuators;motion compensation;positional accuracy;parallel micromechanisms","","154","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

If a guided wave mode is dispersive, a pulse of energy will spread out in space and time as it propagates. For a long-range guided wave inspection application, this constrains the choice of operating point to regions on the dispersion curves where dispersion effects are small. A signal processing technique is presented that enables this constraint on operating point to be relaxed. The technique makes use of a priori knowledge of the dispersion characteristics of a guided wave mode to map signals from the time to distance domains. In the mapping process, dispersed signals are compressed to their original shape. The theoretical basis of the technique is described and an efficient numerical implementation is presented. The robustness of the technique to inaccuracies in the dispersion data is also addressed. The application of the technique to experimental data is shown and the resulting improvement in spatial resolution is demonstrated.

First, the statistical properties of Clarke's fading model with a finite number of sinusoids are analyzed. An improved Clarke's model is then proposed for the simulation of Rayleigh fading channels. Based on this improved Rayleigh fading model, a novel simulation model is proposed for Rician fading channels. The new Rician fading model employs a zero-mean stochastic sinusoid as the specular (line-of-sight) component, in contrast to all existing Rician fading simulators that utilize a non-zero mean deterministic specular component. The statistical properties of the proposed Rician fading model are analyzed in detail. It is shown that the probability density function of the Rician fading phase is not only independent of time but also uniformly distributed over (-/spl pi/, /spl pi/). This property is different from that of existing Rician fading models. The statistical properties of the new simulators are confirmed by extensive simulation results, finding good agreement with theoretical analysis in all cases. An explicit formula for the level crossing rate is derived for general Rician fading when the specular component has non-zero Doppler frequency.","","0-7803-7802-4","10.1109/ICC.2003.1204109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1204109","","Rician channels;Fading;Rayleigh channels;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Frequency;Stochastic processes;Independent component analysis;Probability density function;Land mobile radio","Rayleigh channels;Rician channels;mobile radio;statistical analysis","statistical simulation;Rayleigh fading channels;Rician fading channels;Clarks fading model;sinusoids finite number;zero-mean stochastic sinusoid;specular component, Rician fading simulators;nonzero mean deterministic specular component;probability density function;nonzero Doppler frequency;line-of-sight","","38","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In sharp contrast to digital technology where Moore's law reigns, a fundamental law of physics constrains the ability to realize electrically small antennas that are both efficient and broadband. As a result, covering several frequency bands concurrently with a single antenna having enough efficiency and bandwidth is a major challenge. One possible solution to this problem is to use reconfigurable antennas that tune to different frequency bands. Such an antenna would not cover all bands simultaneously, but provides narrower instantaneous bandwidths that are dynamically selectable at higher efficiency than conventional antennas. Such tunable-antenna technology is an enabler for software-definable radios, the RF front ends of which must be reprogrammable on the fly. This paper discusses the practical implementation issues, limitations, and measured results of small, narrowband, tunable antennas within portable handsets. Many of the concepts discussed in this paper will likely become practical and cost effective in the near future because of recent advances in RF MEMS switches.","1558-4143","","10.1109/MAP.2003.1282191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1282191","","Radio frequency;Broadband antennas;Bandwidth;Communications technology;Switches;Communication switching;Microelectromechanical systems;Micromechanical devices;Moore's Law;Physics","software radio;microswitches;adaptive systems;microstrip antennas;mobile antennas;active antennas;multifrequency antennas;land mobile radio","communications electronics;software-defined radio;SDR;RF switches;microelectromechanical systems;MEMS;antenna design;single antenna;reconfigurable antennas;tunable-antenna technology;RF front ends;adaptive systems;microstrip antennas;mobile antennas;active antenna;multifrequency antennas;land mobile radio equipment","","99","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

For a given number of sensors, the VFA algorithm attempts to maximize the sensor field coverage. A judicious combination of attractive and repulsive forces is used to determine virtual motion paths and the rate of movement for the randomly-placed sensors. Once the effective sensor positions are identified, a one-time movement with energy consideration incorporated is carried out, i.e., the sensors are redeployed to these positions. We also propose a novel probabilistic target localization algorithm that is executed by the cluster head. The localization results are used by the cluster head to query only a few sensors (out of those that report the presence of a target) for more detailed information.

Hyperion can provide effective measures of agricultural performance through the use of established spectral indexes if systematic and random noise is managed. The noise management strategy includes recognition of ""bad"" pixels, reducing the effects of vertical striping, and compensation for atmospheric effects in the data. It also aims to reduce compounding of these effects by image processing. As the noise structure is different for Hyperion's two spectrometers, noise reduction methods are best applied to each separately. Results show that a local destriping algorithm reduces striping noise without introducing unwanted effects in the image. They also show how data smoothing can clean the data and how careful selection of stable Hyperion bands can minimize residual atmospheric effects following atmospheric correction. Comparing hyperspectral indexes derived from Hyperion with the same indexes derived from ground-measured spectra allowed us to assess some of these impacts on the preprocessing options. It has been concluded that preprocessing, which includes fixing bad and outlier pixels, local destriping, atmospheric correction, and minimum noise fraction smoothing, provides improved results. If these or equivalent preprocessing steps are followed, it is feasible to develop a consistent and standardized time series of data that is compatible with field-scale and airborne measured indexes. Red-edge and leaf chlorophyll indexes based on the preprocessed data are shown to distinguish different levels of stress induced by water restrictions.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.813206","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1220232","","Hyperspectral imaging;Noise reduction;Atmospheric measurements;Smoothing methods;Agriculture;Irrigation;Australia;Noise measurement;Image processing;Spectroscopy","geophysical signal processing;geophysical techniques;vegetation mapping;agriculture;multidimensional signal processing","geophysical measurement technique;land surface;vegetation mapping;agriculture;satellite remote sensing;visible;IR;infrared;EO-1;Hyperion;hyperspectral remote sensing;agricultural index;Coleambally Irrigation Area;Australia;local destriping algorithm;striping noise;data smoothing;400 to 2500 nm","","263","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The theory is used to consider DEP trapping, electrorotation, traveling-wave induced motion, and orientational effects. The effective dipole method, and its generalization to effective multipoles, makes it possible to treat multilayered concentric shells and particles exhibiting ohmic and dielectric loss. This method may be extended further to the case of nonspherical particles, where alignment torques can be considered. These capabilities are well suited to modeling DEP behavior of biological particles including cells. The models and methods presented in this review are sufficiently general to be of use in a broad range of applications for biological dielectrophoresis and particle electrokinetics.

However, the positioning systems based on GPS alone face great problems in the so-called urban canyon environments, where the GPS signals are often blocked by high-rise buildings and there are not enough available satellite signals to estimate the positioning information of a fix. To solve the problem, a constrained method is presented by approximately modeling the path of the vehicle in the urban canyon environments as pieces of lines. By adding this constraint, the minimum number of available satellites reduces to two, which is satisfied in many urban canyon environments. Then, different approaches using the constrained method are systematically developed. In addition, a state-augmentation method is proposed to simultaneously estimate the positions of the GPS receiver and the parameters of the line. Furthermore, the interacting multiple model method is used to determine the correct path which the vehicle follows after passing an intersection of roads. Simulation results show that this approach can solve the urban canyon problems successfully.","2374-958X","","10.1109/TRA.2002.807557","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1177161","","Remotely operated vehicles;Mobile robots;Global Positioning System;Land vehicles;Road vehicles;Satellite navigation systems;State estimation;Kalman filters;Filtering;Urban areas","road vehicles;path planning;computerised navigation;Global Positioning System;Kalman filters;state estimation;parameter estimation","GPS;Global Positioning System;navigation;Kalman filtering;interacting multiple model;state estimation;parameter estimation;urban canyon environments;constrained method;path planning;road vehicles","","143","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method adapts itself to various types of image noise as well as to the preference of the medical expert; a single parameter can be used to balance the preservation of (expert-dependent) relevant details against the degree of noise reduction. The algorithm exploits generally valid knowledge about the correlation of significant image features across the resolution scales to perform a preliminary coefficient classification. This preliminary coefficient classification is used to empirically estimate the statistical distributions of the coefficients that represent useful image features on the one hand and mainly noise on the other. The adaptation to the spatial context in the image is achieved by using a wavelet domain indicator of the local spatial activity. The proposed method is of low complexity, both in its implementation and execution time. The results demonstrate its usefulness for noise suppression in medical ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. In these applications, the proposed method clearly outperforms single-resolution spatially adaptive algorithms, in terms of quantitative performance measures as well as in terms of visual quality of the images.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2003.809588","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1199634","","Wavelet domain;Filtration;Biomedical imaging;Noise reduction;Noise robustness;Filtering;Spatial resolution;Image resolution;Statistical distributions;Magnetic noise","biomedical MRI;biomedical ultrasonics;image denoising;medical image processing;wavelet transforms;image resolution;statistical analysis","medical imaging;versatile wavelet domain noise filtration technique;noise filtering;medical images;image noise;medical expert;single parameter;expert-dependent relevant details;noise reduction degree;algorithm;image features;resolution scales;coefficient classification;statistical distributions;wavelet domain indicator;local spatial activity;low complexity;execution time;noise suppression;medical ultrasound imaging;medical magnetic resonance imaging;quantitative performance measures;visual quality","Algorithms;Brain;Computer Simulation;Heart;Humans;Image Enhancement;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Stochastic Processes;Ultrasonography;User-Computer Interface","342","","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A design methodology of such adaptive-bandwidth PLLs and DLLs is described. To assess the impact of each circuit parameter directly, we derive a discrete-time, open-loop dynamic model of the PLL/DLL that characterizes the change in output variables in response to the sampled error and we express the adaptive-bandwidth criteria in terms of the open-loop gains, instead of the traditional closed-loop parameters, /spl omega//sub n/ and /spl zeta/. Applying these criteria, we derive scaling equations for the charge-pump current and filter resistance that achieve adaptive bandwidth in charge-pump PLL/DLLs. We show that previously published adaptive-bandwidth PLL/DLLs, a self-biased PLL/DLL and a regulated-supply PLL/DLL, rely on the small-signal conductance tracking the large-signal conductance of the voltage-controlled oscillator/voltage-controlled delay-line and, thus, sustain constant /spl omega//sub n///spl omega//sub ref/ and /spl zeta/ only if the voltage swing is sufficiently higher than the device threshold voltage V/sub TH/.

The main positive effect of the hybridization is the improvement in the convergence speed to the Pareto front. On the other hand, the main negative effect is the increase in the computation time per generation. Thus, the number of generations is decreased when the available computation time is limited. As a result, the global search ability of EMO algorithms is not fully utilized. These positive and negative effects are examined by computational experiments on multiobjective permutation flowshop scheduling problems. Results of our computational experiments clearly show the importance of striking a balance between genetic search and local search. In this paper, we first modify our former multiobjective genetic local search (MOGLS) algorithm by choosing only good individuals as initial solutions for local search and assigning an appropriate local search direction to each initial solution. Next, we demonstrate the importance of striking a balance between genetic search and local search through computational experiments. Then we compare the modified MOGLS with recently developed EMO algorithms: the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm and revised nondominated sorting genetic algorithm.

We discuss the basic concepts of CCSK and describe a system based on the use of random or pseudorandom codes for biphase modulation. We use simulation to show that the bit error rate (BER) for CCSK can be closely estimated by using existing equations that apply to M-ary orthogonal signaling (MOS). Also, we show that significantly fewer computations are required for CCSK than for MOS when the number of bits per symbol is the same. We show that using biphase modulation results in waveforms that have a large time-bandwidth product and very low input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and thus inherently have an LPI by a radiometer. We evaluate detection by a radiometer and show that LPI can be achieved by using codes of lengths greater than about 2/sup 12/ (i.e., by transmitting more than about 12 bits per symbol). Results illustrate the effect that the CCSK symbol length and error probability, and the radiometer integration time and probability of false alarm (PFA), have on detection by a radiometer. We describe a variation of CCSK called truncated CCSK (TCCSK). In this system, the code of length 2/sup k/ is cyclically shifted, then truncated and transmitted. Although shortened, the truncated code still represents k bits of information, thus leading to an increased data rate. We evaluate radiometer detection of TCCSK and it is shown that the probability of detection is increased compared with the detection of CCSK.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2003.1238736","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1238736","","Radiometry;Bit error rate;Error probability;Automotive engineering;Multilevel systems;Modulation coding;Computational modeling;Equations;Signal to noise ratio;Postal services","probability;cyclic codes;random sequences;error statistics","cyclic code shift keying;low probability of intercept;LPI;CCSK;random codes;pseudorandom codes;biphase modulation;bit error rate;M-ary orthogonal signaling;time-bandwidth product;input signal-to-noise ratio;radiometer integration time;probability of false alarm;truncated CCSK","","86","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

More specifically, these properties are examined within the context of the popular linear antiwindup augmentation paradigm. Linear antiwindup augmentation refers to designing a linear filter to augment a linear control system subject to a local specification, called the ""unconstrained closed-loop behavior."" Building on known results on H/sub /spl infin// and LPV synthesis, the fixed order linear antiwindup synthesis feasibility problem is cast as a nonconvex matrix optimization problem, which has an attractive system theoretic interpretation: the lower bound on the achievable L/sub 2/ performance is the maximum of the open and unconstrained closed-loop L/sub 2/ gains. In the special cases of zero-order (static) and plant-order antiwindup compensation, the feasibility conditions become (convex) linear matrix inequalities. It is shown that, if (and only if) the plant is asymptotically stable, plant-order linear antiwindup compensation is always feasible for large enough L/sub 2/ gain and that static antiwindup compensation is feasible provided a quasi-common Lyapunov function, between the open-loop and unconstrained closed-loop, exists. Using the solutions to the matrix feasibility problems, the synthesis of the antiwindup augmentation achieving the desired level of L/sub 2/ performance is then accomplished by solving an additional LMI.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2003.816965","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1231247","","Linear systems;Control system synthesis;Control systems;Linear matrix inequalities;Optimal control;Linear feedback control systems;Automatic control;Stability;Nonlinear filters;Buildings","linear matrix inequalities;linear systems;cost optimal control;control system synthesis","closed-loop;quadratic stability;linear control systems;cost optimal control;antiwindup synthesis;linear matrix inequalities;linear parameter varying;Lyapunov function","","375","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

FastSLAM, an alternative approach based on the Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter, has been shown to scale logarithmically with the number of landmarks in the map. This efficiency enables FastSLAM to be applied to environments far larger than could be handled by the EKF. In this paper, we show that FastSLAM also substantially outperforms the EKF in environments with ambiguous data association. The performance of the two algorithms is compared on a real-world data set with various levels of odometric noise.

From the investigation of reverse current-voltage (I-V) characteristics, temperature dependencies of leakage current, and device simulations we found that for a wide depletion, such as n-well/p-well, thermal Shockley-Read-Hall generation is the main leakage mechanism, while for a junction with higher dopant concentrations, such as n/sup +//p-well or p/sup +//n-well, tunneling and impact ionization are the dominant mechanisms.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2002.807249","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1185166","","Leakage currents;Tunneling;Impact ionization;Integrated circuit modeling;Conductivity;Integrated circuit testing;Photodiodes","CMOS image sensors;leakage currents;tunnelling;impact ionisation;integrated circuit modelling;dark conductivity;integrated circuit testing;photodiodes","leakage current modeling;CMOS test structures;dark current characterization;leakage current mechanisms;photodiodes;pixel architectures;active pixel CMOS image sensors;photodiode edge depletion;reset transistor source;reverse I-V characteristics;current-voltage characteristics;thermal Shockley-Read-Hall generation;tunneling;impact ionization;0.35 micron","","67","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Almost all of voice and data (internet) traffic is routed through terrestrial and submarine optical fiber links, connecting the world together. Invention of the optical amplifiers (OAs) and wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) technology enabled very high capacity optical fiber communication links that run for thousands of kilometers without any electronic repeaters, but at the same time brought many design challenges. As electronic amplifiers do, OAs add noise to the signal they amplify. In the design of an optical fiber communication link, the prediction of the deterioration the information signals experience due to the nonlinearity of the optical fiber and the optical noise generated by the OAs is essential. In this paper, we first present a short overview of optical fiber communication systems and the challenges that faces one from a modeling, analysis and design perspective. Then, we describe novel formulations and computational techniques for the analysis of the interplay between the information signals and the optical noise due to the fiber nonlinearity as they propagate together along the fiber link. Our formulations are similar, in spirit, to the linear(ized), time-varying formulations for noise analysis in analog/RF electronic circuits. We then investigate signal-noise mixing due to optical fiber nonlinearities using the techniques developed. Finally, we discuss the use of the generated results in the performance evaluation of communication links, and comment on system design implications.","","1-58113-762-1","10.1109/ICCAD.2003.159721","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1257814","","Optical noise;Optical fiber communication;Optical fibers;Optical design;Wavelength division multiplexing;Spine;Internet;Underwater vehicles;Joining processes;Stimulated emission","optical fibre communication;telecommunication links;optical fibre amplifiers;wavelength division multiplexing;telecommunication traffic;optical noise","noise analysis;optical fiber communication systems;optical fiber transmission links;voice traffic;data traffic;optical amplifiers;OA;wavelength division multiplexing technology;WDM technology;electronic repeaters;electronic amplifiers;optical noise;linearized formulations;time varying formulations;analog electronic circuits;RF electronic circuits;radio frequency electronic circuits;optical fiber nonlinearities","","2","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The current sense amplifier senses the cell current directly and shows a speed improvement of 17-20% for 128 memory cells as compared to the conventional voltage mode sense amplifier, for the same energy. The other is a charge transfer sense amplifier that takes advantage of large bit-line capacitance for its operation. The CTSA shows an improvement of 18-22% for read delay for 128 memory cells and consumes 15-18% less energy than the voltage mode sense amplifier. The CTSA results in reduced bit-line swing, which in turn leads to 30% lower bit-line energy than the conventional voltage mode.","","0-7803-8182-3","10.1109/SOC.2003.1241474","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1241474","","Random access memory;Capacitance;Voltage;Charge transfer;Delay;Operational amplifiers;CMOS technology;Integrated circuit interconnections;Differential amplifiers;Microprocessors","circuit simulation;low-power electronics;SRAM chips;integrated circuit design;amplifiers;CMOS memory circuits","SRAM sense-amplifier;high-performance sense-amplifier;low-voltage sense-amplifier;bit-line capacitance;on-chip caches;current sense amplifier;CSA;charge transfer sense amplifier;CTSA;CMOS technology;sensing speed improvement;read delay improvement;bit-line swing reduction;90 nm","","24","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed control approach is based on one-cycle control and features great simplicity and reliability: all three phases will be power factor corrected using one or two integrators with reset along with several flips-flops, comparators and logic and linear components. It does not require multipliers to scale the current reference according to the output power level as used in many other control approaches. In addition, the input voltage sensor is eliminated. It employs constant switching frequency modulation that is desirable for industrial applications.

A tendency can be observed to erect these turbines in wind parks, connected to the high voltage transmission grid. These parks effect the dynamic behaviour of power systems, because in wind turbines generator types that are different from the conventional synchronous generator are used. To investigate the impact of a wind park on the dynamics of the power system to which it is connected, an adequate model is required. In order to avoid the necessity of developing a detailed model of a wind park with tens or hundreds of wind turbines and their interconnections and to calculate the wind speed signal for each individual turbine, aggregated wind park models are needed. In the paper, aggregated models for wind parks equipped with either constant or variable speed wind turbines are presented. It is shown that results obtained with an aggregated model and with a detailed model show a high degree of correspondence, both for normal operation and for disturbances.","","0-7803-7967-5","10.1109/PTC.2003.1304458","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1304458","","Power system modeling;Power system dynamics;Power system simulation;Wind turbines;Wind energy generation;Synchronous generators;Power system interconnection;Wind power generation;Voltage;Power generation","wind power plants;wind turbines;power system interconnection;transmission networks;synchronous generators","power system dynamics simulations;wind parks;electrical power generation;high voltage transmission grid;wind turbines generator","","47","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents an efficient approach for volt/Var control in radial distribution networks takes DGs performance into consideration. In general distributed generations can be considered as PV or PQ nodes. In this paper DGs are modeled as PV nodes. The goal of this approach is to minimize power losses at distribution system through controlling the tap of load tap changer (LTC), size of substation capacitor, local controller settings and voltage amplitude of DGs.

The fault-detection index is composed of two complex phasors and the angle difference between the two phasors determines whether the fault is internal or external to the protected zone. The fault types can be classified by the modal fault-detection index. The proposed scheme also combines online parameter estimation to ensure protection scheme performance and achieve adaptive protection.

The DC motor is an attractive piece of equipment in many industrial applications requiring variable speed and load characteristics due to its ease of controllability. Microcontrollers provide a suitable means of meeting these needs. Certainty, part of the recent activity on microcontrollers can be ascribed to their newness and challenge. In this paper, implementation of the MC68HC11E9 microcontroller for speed control of DC motor fed by a DC chopper has been investigated. The chopper is driven by a high frequency PWM signal. Controlling the PWM duty cycle is equivalent to controlling the motor terminal voltage, which in turn adjusts directly the motor speed. Experimental results have been obtained that show the employment of microcontroller for speed control and over current protection of a DC motor.","","0-7803-8208-0","10.1109/PECON.2003.1437427","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437427","","Microcontrollers;DC motors;Velocity control;Pulse width modulation;Electrical equipment industry;Choppers;Voltage control;Industrial control;Controllability;Frequency","DC motor drives;variable speed drives;microcontrollers;angular velocity control;voltage control;overcurrent protection;DC motor protection;choppers (circuits);machine control;reliability;PWM power convertors","DC motor speed control system;electric drive systems;industrial applications;reliability;variable speed drives;load characteristics;MC68HC11E9 microcontroller;DC chopper;PWM duty cycle;motor terminal voltage control;overcurrent protection;motor protection","","7","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In terms of commercial energy, this list currently includes hydro, wind, biomass, geothermal, and solar. In the 1970s and 1980s, the interest in green power was driven by the goal of replacing fossil fuels to minimize the dependence on oil. Now there is a broader goal: to minimize the emission of CO2 (the most common global warming gas) that results from the burning of fossil fuels.

This is made possible by the strong electromechanical coupling associated with modern piezoelectric transducers. In vibration control applications, a piezoelectric transducer is bonded to, or embedded in a base structure. As the structure deforms, the piezoelectric element strains and converts a portion of the structural vibration energy into electrical energy. By shunting the piezoelectric transducer to an electrical impedance, a part of the induced electrical energy can be dissipated. Hence, the impedance acts as a means of extracting mechanical energy from the base structure. This paper reviews recent research related to the use of shunted piezoelectric elements for vibration damping and control. In particular, the paper presents an overview of the literature on piezoelectric shunt damping and discusses recent observations on the feedback nature of piezoelectric shunt damping systems.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2003.813371","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1208326","","Technological innovation;Vibration control;Damping;Piezoelectric transducers;Impedance;Flexible structures;Bonding;Capacitive sensors;Mechanical energy;Feedback","flexible structures;vibration control;damping;piezoelectric transducers;piezoelectric actuators;feedback","vibration control;damping;shunted piezoelectric transducers;flexible structures;structural vibration energy;synthetic impedance;passive control;feedback","","191","","75","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The tag contains a large array of solid-state memory and records continuously from a built-in hydrophone and suite of sensors. The sensors sample the orientation of the animal in three dimensions with sufficient speed and resolution to capture individual fluke strokes. Audio and sensor recording is synchronous so the relative timing of sounds and motion can be determined precisely. The DTAG has been attached to more than 30 northern right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) and 20 sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) with recording duration of up to 12 h per deployment.

We introduce a 3D eye tracking system where the head motion is allowed without the need for markers or worn devices. We use a pair of stereo systems: a wide angle stereo system detects the face and steers an active narrow FOV stereo system to track the eye at high resolution. For high resolution tracking, the eye is modeled in 3D, including the corneal ball, pupil and fovea.

Based on this distribution, a test statistic for equality of two such matrices and an associated asymptotic probability for obtaining a smaller value of the test statistic are derived and applied successfully to change detection in polarimetric SAR data.

Bochum, Germany","IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","","2003","38","2","184","191","Millimeter-wave voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) are presented which are fully integrated in a SiGe bipolar production technology. The low-cost differential circuits have been designed and optimized for low phase noise and wide tuning range. As an example, by varying the bias voltage of the on-chip varactor, the oscillation frequency can be changed from 36 to 46.9 GHz (i.e., by 26%). In this wide frequency range, phase noise between -107 and -110dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset frequency and single-ended voltage swing of about 0.95V/sub pp/ ±10% (differential: 1.9V/sub pp/) were measured. The circuit consumes 280mW at -5.5-V supply voltage. The high oscillation frequency and low phase noise at wide tuning range are record values for fully integrated oscillators in Si-based technologies. The basic oscillator was then extended by a cascode stage as an output buffer. Now the VCO performance is no longer degraded if nonperfectly terminated transmission lines are driven. Thus, the chip can be mounted in a low-cost socket; however, at the cost of increased phase noise and power consumption.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2002.807404","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1175498","","Millimeter wave technology;Phase noise;Silicon germanium;Germanium silicon alloys;Production;Frequency;Circuit optimization;Integrated circuit technology;Voltage;Millimeter wave integrated circuits","Ge-Si alloys;bipolar MIMIC;millimetre wave oscillators;voltage-controlled oscillators;phase noise;circuit tuning;integrated circuit noise;circuit optimisation;semiconductor materials","SiGe bipolar production technology;mm-wave VCOs;wide tuning range;low phase noise;millimeter-wave voltage-controlled oscillators;low-cost differential circuits;bias voltage variation;on-chip varactor;oscillation frequency;single-ended voltage swing;high oscillation frequency;fully integrated oscillators;cascode stage;output buffer;VCO performance;nonperfectly terminated transmission lines;low-cost socket;power consumption;0.35 micron;36 to 46.9 GHz;280 mW;-5.5 V;SiGe","","118","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With massive scale also comes massive instability, as node and link failures become the norm rather than the exception. For such highly volatile systems, decentralized gossip-based protocols are emerging as an approach to maintaining simplicity and scalability while achieving fault-tolerant information dissemination. In this paper, we study the problem of computing aggregates with gossip-style protocols. Our first contribution is an analysis of simple gossip-based protocols for the computation of sums, averages, random samples, quantiles, and other aggregate functions, and we show that our protocols converge exponentially fast to the true answer when using uniform gossip. Our second contribution is the definition of a precise notion of the speed with which a node's data diffuses through the network. We show that this diffusion speed is at the heart of the approximation guarantees for all of the above problems. We analyze the diffusion speed of uniform gossip in the presence of node and link failures, as well as for flooding-based mechanisms. The latter expose interesting connections to random walks on graphs.","0272-5428","0-7695-2040-5","10.1109/SFCS.2003.1238221","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1238221","","Aggregates;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Large-scale systems;Temperature sensors;Distributed computing;Computer science;Scalability;Fault tolerant systems;Stress","computer networks;fault tolerant computing;computer network reliability;protocols","gossip-based computation;aggregate information;computer connectivity;distributed systems;instability;node failures;link failures;volatile systems;decentralized gossip-based protocols;scalability;fault-tolerant information dissemination;aggregate computation;gossip-style protocols;random samples;quantiles;aggregate functions;exponential convergence;uniform gossip;data diffusion;diffusion speed;flooding-based mechanisms;random walks","","559","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since stator resistance inevitably varies with operating conditions, stable and accurate operation at near-zero speed requires an appropriate online identification algorithm for the stator resistance. The paper proposes such an identification algorithm, which is developed for the rotor flux-based model reference adaptive system (MRAS) type of the speed estimator in conjunction with a rotor flux oriented control scheme. In this speed estimation method, only one degree of freedom (out of the two available) is utilized for speed estimation. It is proposed to utilize the second available degree of freedom as a means for adapting the stator resistance online. The parallel stator resistance and rotor speed identification algorithm is developed in a systematic manner, using Popov's hyperstability theory. It increases the complexity of the overall control system insignificantly and enables correct speed estimation and stable drive operation at near-zero speeds. The proposed speed estimator with parallel stator resistance identification is at first verified by simulation. Extensive experimentation is conducted next at low speeds of rotation and successful stator resistance identification is achieved down to 0.5-Hz frequency of rotation.","1558-0059","","10.1109/TEC.2003.816595","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1247772","","Stators;Rotors;Induction motor drives;Induction motors;Sensorless control;Adaptive systems;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Control systems;Frequency","induction motor drives;parameter estimation;machine vector control;stators;electric resistance;model reference adaptive control systems;rotors","stator resistance estimation;speed sensorless rotor flux oriented induction motor drives;speed sensorless induction motor control;stator resistance;operating conditions;near-zero speed;rotor flux-based model reference adaptive system;rotor flux oriented control scheme;parallel stator resistance;rotor speed identification algorithm;Popov's hyperstability theory;stable drive operation;parallel stator resistance identification","","112","","46","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since the fundamental components of voltages and currents are converted into DC components on the d-q coordinate both in the steady and transient states, the harmonics of voltages and currents can be obtained precisely through the low-pass filer installed on the d-q coordinate. This results in the economical active filter with a small capacitor suppressing the DC bus voltage fluctuation because the fundamental power can be fully removed from the active filter input.","","0-7803-7883-0","10.1109/IAS.2003.1257706","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1257706","","Active filters;Voltage;Capacitors;Reactive power;Signal analysis;Fluctuations;Power harmonic filters;Chemical technology;Power generation economics;Power system harmonics","active filters;Hilbert transforms;power harmonic filters;power system harmonics;distribution networks","control strategy;single-phase active filter;d-q transformation;Hilbert transform;instantaneous single-phase voltage;instantaneous single-phase current;complex vectors;instantaneous basis;DC components;d-q coordinate;transient state;steady state;low-pass filter;DC bus voltage fluctuation;economical active filter;harmonic voltages suppression;harmonic currents suppression;power distribution systems;reactive power;active power;DC bus voltage regulation","","72","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a method to determine the above material parameters from a three-point bending test. In the experiment, a pre-notched beam is used. Corresponding values of load, crack mouth opening and acement, and load point displacement are simultaneously recorded. From experimentally determined load-crack mouth opening displacement curves, the above-mentioned crack bridging parameters are deduced by a numerical procedure.

Since WAP will also be a common feature found in future mobile communication devices, it is worthwhile to investigate its use in telemedicine. This paper describes the implementation and experiences with a WAP-based telemedicine system for patient-monitoring that has been developed in our laboratory. It utilizes WAP devices as mobile access terminals for general inquiry and patient-monitoring services. Authorized users can browse the patients' general data, monitored blood pressure (BP), and electrocardiogram (ECG) on WAP devices in store-and-forward mode. The applications, written in wireless markup language (WML), WMLScript, and Perl, resided in a content server. A MySQL relational database system was set up to store the BP readings, ECG data, patient records, clinic and hospital information, and doctors' appointments with patients. A wireless ECG subsystem was built for recording ambulatory ECG in an indoor environment and for storing ECG data into the database. For testing, a WAP phone compliant with WAP 1.1 was used at GSM 1800 MHz by circuit-switched data (CSD) to connect to the content server through a WAP gateway, which was provided by a mobile phone service provider in Hong Kong. Data were successfully retrieved from the database and displayed on the WAP phone.

The simulations agree very well with measurements performed on a 24-GHz three-pole MEMS tunable filter. It is shown that MEMS capacitive components with a spring constant k>10 N/m generate very low intermodulation, as compared to semiconductor devices, and lead to a two-tone third-order intermodulation intercept point (IIP3) greater than +40 dBm for /spl Delta/f>3-5f/sub 0/, where f/sub 0/ is the mechanical resonant frequency. In fact, the IIP3 increases to +80 dBm for a difference signal (/spl Delta/f) of 5 MHz. The CAD model also allows the evaluation of the power-handling capabilities of the tunable filter and, it is seen that, for the case presented here, distortions become significant for an input power greater than +20 dBm.

Machines & Drives Group, Univ. of Wuppertal, Germany; NA","IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","","2003","39","4","1052","1060","The performance of sensorless-controlled induction motors is poor at very low speed. The reasons are the limited accuracy of stator voltage acquisition and the presence of offset and drift components in the acquired signals. To overcome these problems, a pure integrator is employed for stator flux estimation. The time-variable DC offset voltage is estimated from the flux drift in a parallel stator model and used to eliminate the offset by feedforward control.

Communication is the medium through which team members share the information required for successful amalgamation. In this work, we postulate that both high and low levels of team communication can impede team performance, thus leading to a curvilinear relationship between team performance and team communication. To test this hypothesis, the relationships between face-to-face, e-mail, and telephone communication and team performance were examined for 60 cross-functional project teams. E-mail and face-to-face communication were curvilinearly associated with performance, but telephone communication was not. Further analysis of the communication frequency between colocations showed that e-mail is the only medium for which usage increased with distance.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2003.817298","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1236002","","Professional communication;Electronic mail","professional communication;electronic mail","curvilinear relationship;communication frequency;team performance;cross-functional project teams;team members;e-mail;telephone communication;face-to-face communication;e-mail communication","","83","","43","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Wang","Kocaeli Univ., Turkey; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Industry Applications Magazine","","2003","9","2","21","28","This article presents the modeling and control of the integration of a StatCom (static-synchronous compensator) with SMES (superconducting magnetic energy storage system) and its dynamic response to system oscillations caused by a three-phase fault. It has been shown that the StatCom-SMES combination can be very effective in damping power system oscillations. Adding energy storage enhances the performance of a StatCom and possibly reduces the MVA ratings requirements of the StatCom operating alone. This is important for a cost/benefit analysis of installing flexible AC transmission system controllers on utility systems. It should be noted that, in this study, the StatCom provides a real power flow path for SMES, but the SMES controller is independent of the StatCom controller. While the StatCom is ordered to absorb or inject reactive power, the SMES is ordered to absorb/inject real power. It was also observed that the location where the combined compensator is connected is important for improvement of overall system dynamic performance. Although the use of a reactive power controller seems more effective in a load area, this simulation study shows that a StatCom with real power capability can damp the power system oscillations more effectively, thereby stabilizing the system faster-if the StatCom-SMES controller is located near a generation area rather than a load area.","1558-0598","","10.1109/MIA.2003.1180946","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1180946","","Automatic voltage control;Samarium;Power system dynamics;Power system modeling;Power system simulation;Superconducting magnetic energy storage;Damping;Power system analysis computing;Power system faults;Energy storage","power system control;superconducting magnet energy storage;static VAr compensators;oscillations;damping;reactive power control;power system stability;cost-benefit analysis;power system economics","StatCom;SMES;dynamic response;system oscillations;three-phase fault;power system oscillations damping;energy storage;cost/benefit analysis;static-synchronous compensators;superconducting magnetic energy storage;flexible AC transmission system controllers;real power flow path;reactive power absorption;reactive power injection;reactive power controller;load area;real power capability;power system stabilisation","","43","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

By using the Tchebyshev representation of a discrete-time transfer function and some new results on root counting with respect to the unit circle, we show how the digital PID stabilizing gains can be determined by solving sets of linear inequalities in two unknowns for a fixed value of the third parameter. By sweeping or gridding over this parameter, the entire set of stabilizing gains can be recovered. The precise admissible range of this parameter can be predetermined. This solution is attractive because it answers the question of whether there exists a stabilizing solution or not and in case stabilization is possible the entire set of gains is determined constructively. Using this characterization of the stabilizing set we present solutions to two design problems: 1) maximally deadbeat design, where we determine for the given plant, the smallest circle within the unit circle wherein the closed loop system characteristic roots may be placed by PID control and 2) maximal delay tolerance, where we determine, for the given plant the maximal-loop delay that can be tolerated under PID control. In each case, the set of controllers attaining the specifications is calculated.

The method comprises two novel aspects. First, torque is estimated as a function of terminal quantities, i.e., flux linkage and phase current. Hence, torque estimation is independent of the rotor position. Secondly, high-bandwidth drive performance is obtained by implementing a digital torque hysteresis controller. Thus, the method works without torque profile functions and auxiliary phase commutating strategies. Therefore, the control algorithm offers a wide drive operating range without the use of a high-resolution shaft position sensor or sensitive position estimation techniques.

This paper presents a mean shift-based approach for local bandwidth selection in the multimodal, multivariate case. The method is based on a fundamental property of normal distributions regarding the bias of the normalized density gradient. This paper demonstrates that, within the large sample approximation, the local covariance is estimated by the matrix that maximizes the magnitude of the normalized mean shift vector. Using this property, the paper develops a reliable algorithm which takes into account the stability of local bandwidth estimates across scales.

Today two of the major global automotive companies have hybrid electric vehicles for sale in most areas of the globe with cumulative sales now exceeding 120k. Whereas battery electric vehicles may find niche applications in route travel and short commuting the hybrid electric vehicle provides un-compromised utility and fuel economy benefits ranging from 5% to 50% or higher compared to the nonhybrid base vehicle. AC drives are now ubiquitous in hybridized power trains due to their high durability and ease of control via power electronics. However, because of the unique application requirements of an automotive propulsion system the present AC drives are still inadequate in meeting the full drive system performance requirements and package volume targets. Consequently, today's hybridized power trains continue to utilize AC drives that have either over rated electric machines or power electronics or both. This paper is motivated by the premise that the most economical solution to wide CPSR and overall performance of AC drives for hybrids rests on power electronics. The paper describes the present situation and what efforts are underway, principally in transmission systems, to provide AC drives that are better matched to personal transportation vehicles.","","0-7803-7768-0","10.1109/APEC.2003.1179171","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1179171","","Power electronics;Hybrid electric vehicles;Battery powered vehicles;Automotive engineering;Marketing and sales;Fuel economy;Propulsion;System performance;Electronics packaging;Packaging machines","hybrid electric vehicles;power electronics;AC motor drives;automobiles","power electronics;hybrid electric vehicle applications;customer acceptance;battery electric vehicles;global automotive companies;route travel;short commuting;fuel economy;AC drives;hybridized power trains;high durability;automotive propulsion system;package volume;over rated electric machines;over rated power electronics;transmission systems;personal transportation vehicles;power train;30 kW","","42","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unlike wired networks, random packet loss due to bit errors is not negligible in wireless networks, and this causes significant performance degradation of transmission control protocol (TCP). We propose and study a novel end-to-end congestion control mechanism called TCP Veno that is simple and effective for dealing with random packet loss. A key ingredient of Veno is that it monitors the network congestion level and uses that information to decide whether packet losses are likely to be due to congestion or random bit errors. Specifically: (1) it refines the multiplicative decrease algorithm of TCP Reno-the most widely deployed TCP version in practice-by adjusting the slow-start threshold according to the perceived network congestion level rather than a fixed drop factor and (2) it refines the linear increase algorithm so that the connection can stay longer in an operating region in which the network bandwidth is fully utilized. Based on extensive network testbed experiments and live Internet measurements, we show that Veno can achieve significant throughput improvements without adversely affecting other concurrent TCP connections, including other concurrent Reno connections. In typical wireless access networks with 1% random packet loss rate, throughput improvement of up to 80% can be demonstrated. A salient feature of Veno is that it modifies only the sender-side protocol of Reno without changing the receiver-side protocol stack.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2002.807336","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1177186","","Wireless networks;Access protocols;IP networks;Throughput;Wireless LAN;Home automation;Land mobile radio cellular systems;Propagation losses;Error correction;Performance loss","transport protocols;radio access networks;wireless LAN;Internet;performance evaluation;packet radio networks;cellular radio","TCP Veno;TCP enhancement;wireless access networks;wireless local area networks;home networks;cellular networks;random packet loss;bit errors;transmission control protocol;congestion control;network congestion level;random bit errors;multiplicative decrease algorithm;slow-start threshold;linear increase algorithm;network bandwidth;network testbed experiments;Internet measurements;random packet loss rate;throughput;sender-side protocol;receiver-side protocol stack","","234","","41","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Slot radiating elements, having a planar geometry and capable of transmitting vertical polarization when placed nearly horizontal, are appropriate for the applications at hand. Slot antennas also have another useful property, so far as impedance matching is concerned. Basically, slot dipoles can easily be excited by a microstrip line and can be matched to arbitrary line impedances simply by moving the feed point along the slot. Antenna miniaturization can be achieved by using a high permittivity or permeability substrate and superstrate materials and/or using an appropriate antenna topology. We demonstrate miniaturization by designing an appropriate geometry for a resonant narrow slot antenna. A very efficient radiating element that occupies an area as small as 0.12/spl lambda//sub 0//spl times/0.12/spl lambda//sub 0/ is designed and tested. Simulation results, as well as the measured input impedance and radiation patterns of this antenna, are presented.

Maximizing the piezoelectric generator's output power is done by maximizing the product of generated voltage and output current. The maximization methods are derived from the mechanical and electrical models of the generator and provide design guidelines as to the geometric dimensions of the piezoelectric material and circuital conditions that will produce maximum power in the device. The theoretical results show the peak stack voltage to increase with an increasing thickness to area ratio of the piezoelectric material and with increasing applied force. However, in contrast to the peak output voltage, the peak output current increases with the decreasing of thickness to area ratio of the material. In addition to the physical dimension, the peak stack current increases as the value of the antenna inductor decreases. The output power of the piezoelectric generator, which is the product of output voltage and current, linearly increases with the thickness to area ratio. This result is due to the fact that the output voltage is larger comparing to the output current. Experimental results are also given to verify the theoretical results and represent the performance of several types of piezoelectric materials with different thickness to area ratios. The experimental results show good agreement with theoretical predictions.

AIRS is an infrared spectrometer/radiometer that covers the 3.7-15.4-/spl mu/m spectral range with 2378 spectral channels. AMSU is a 15-channel microwave radiometer operating between 23 and 89 GHz. HSB is a four-channel microwave radiometer that makes measurements between 150 and 190 GHz. In addition to supporting the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's interest in process study and climate research, AIRS is the first hyperspectral infrared radiometer designed to support the operational requirements for medium-range weather forecasting of the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and other numerical weather forecasting centers. AIRS, together with the AMSU and HSB microwave radiometers, will achieve global retrieval accuracy of better than 1 K in the lower troposphere under clear and partly cloudy conditions. This paper presents an overview of the science objectives, AIRS/AMSU/HSB data products, retrieval algorithms, and the ground-data processing concepts. The EOS Aqua was launched on May 4, 2002 from Vandenberg AFB, CA, into a 705-km-high, sun-synchronous orbit.

Several noniterative image reconstruction methods are used currently to compensate for field inhomogeneities, but these methods assume that the field map that characterizes the off-resonance frequencies is spatially smooth. Recently, iterative methods have been proposed that can circumvent this assumption and provide improved compensation for off-resonance effects. However, straightforward implementations of such iterative methods suffer from inconveniently long computation times. This paper describes a tool for accelerating iterative reconstruction of field-corrected MR images: a novel time-segmented approximation to the MR signal equation. We use a min-max formulation to derive the temporal interpolator. Speedups of around 60 were achieved by combining this temporal interpolator with a nonuniform fast Fourier transform with normalized root mean squared approximation errors of 0.07%. The proposed method provides fast, accurate, field-corrected image reconstruction even when the field map is not smooth.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2002.808360","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1194628","","Image reconstruction;Magnetic resonance imaging;Iterative methods;Biomedical engineering;Magnetic fields;Frequency;Image segmentation;Reconstruction algorithms;Optical imaging;Spirals","biomedical MRI;iterative methods;image reconstruction;medical image processing;fast Fourier transforms","magnetic field inhomogeneities;fast iterative image reconstruction;MRI;magnetic resonance imaging;image distortions;noniterative image reconstruction methods;spatially smooth field map;field-corrected MR images;time-segmented approximation;MR signal equation;min-max formulation;temporal interpolator;nonuniform fast Fourier transform;off-resonance frequencies;normalized root mean squared approximation errors;field map","Algorithms;Brain;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Positron-Emission Tomography;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Time Factors","236","","50","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The required rating of the active filter is much smaller than that of a conventional standalone active filter be. In addition, no additional switching-ripple filter is required for the hybrid filter because the LC filter functions not only as a harmonic filter tuned at the seventh harmonic frequency but also as a switching-ripple filter around 10 kHz.

High-quality AlGaN/GaN heterostructures were grown, and heterostructure field effect transistors (HFETs) using a Fat FET geometry were fabricated. Measurements of 2-DEG mobility were performed by magnetoresistance and capacitance-conductance. In order to understand the dominant transport factors, the mobility was modeled using different scattering mechanisms and compared to our results. It is found that mobility dependence on n/sub s/ shows a bell-shape behavior over the whole temperature range. For low n/sub s/ the mobility is dominated by Coulomb interaction from interface charge, and at high n/sub s/ the mobility is dominated by interface roughness. Using previously reported experimental values of interface charge and interface roughness in our modeling, we show good agreement with mobility measurement results. Scattering from interface states in AlGaN/GaN heterostructures, seems to be related to the high polarization field in the heterointerface. At temperatures higher than 200K polar optical phonon scattering dominates the transport, yet both interface charge and roughness affect the mobility at the low and high n/sub s/, respectively.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2003.816103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232916","","Aluminum compounds;Gallium compounds;Semiconductor heterojunctions;Charge carrier mobility;Charge carrier density;Magnetoresistance;JFETs","aluminium compounds;gallium compounds;III-V semiconductors;semiconductor heterojunctions;two-dimensional electron gas;electron mobility;carrier density;magnetoresistance;junction gate field effect transistors;wide band gap semiconductors","electron mobility;two-dimensional electron gas;carrier concentration;temperature dependence;AlGaN/GaN heterostructure;electronic transport;heterostructure field effect transistor;magnetoresistance;capacitance-conductance;Coulomb interaction;polarization field;interface charge scattering;interface roughness scattering;interface states;polar optical phonon scattering;FAT HFET;AlGaN-GaN","","55","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the interface ultimately determines the functionality supported by the devices, and current interfaces are holding system designers back. Storage technology has progressed to the point that a change in the device interface is needed. Object-based storage is an emerging standard designed to address this problem.

It is then obvious that, although these analyses provide evidence of brain activity changes prior to epileptic seizures, they cannot be applied to develop implantable devices for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. In this paper, we describe an adaptive procedure to prospectively analyze continuous, long-term EEG recordings when only the occurring time of the first seizure is known. The algorithm is based on the convergence and divergence of short-term maximum Lyapunov exponents (STLmax) among critical electrode sites selected adaptively. A warning of an impending seizure is then issued. Global optimization techniques are applied for selecting the critical groups of electrode sites. The adaptive seizure prediction algorithm (ASPA) was tested in continuous 0.76 to 5.84 days intracranial EEG recordings from a group of five patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. A fixed parameter setting applied to all cases predicted 82% of seizures with a false prediction rate of 0.16/h. Seizure warnings occurred an average of 71.7 min before ictal onset. Similar results were produced by dividing the available EEG recordings into half training and testing portions. Optimizing the parameters for individual patients improved sensitivity (84% overall) and reduced false prediction rate (0.12/h overall). These results indicate that ASPA can be applied to implantable devices for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2003.810689","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1198251","","Epilepsy;Biomedical engineering;Electroencephalography;Systems engineering and theory;Neuroscience;Medical diagnostic imaging;Chaos;Brain;Electrodes;Testing","electroencephalography;diseases;medical signal processing;Lyapunov methods;biomedical electrodes;medical signal detection;nonlinear dynamical systems;prediction theory;brain models","adaptive epileptic seizure prediction system;electroencephalogram recordings;brain activity changes;implantable devices;diagnostic purposes;therapeutic purposes;continuous long-term EEG recordings;occurring time;first seizure;convergence;divergence;short-term maximum Lyapunov exponents;critical electrode sites;global optimization techniques;adaptive seizure prediction algorithm;intracranial EEG recordings;refractory temporal lobe epilepsy;fixed parameter setting;false prediction rate;ictal onset;training;testing;sensitivity","Algorithms;Brain Mapping;Electrodes, Implanted;Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Epilepsy;False Positive Reactions;Feedback;Frontal Lobe;Hippocampus;Humans;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Quality Control;Reproducibility of Results;Seizures;Seizures;Sensitivity and Specificity;Temporal Lobe","278","","44","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, the cost of a direct extension of the FGT to higher-dimensional problems grows exponentially with dimension, making it impractical for dimensions above 3. We develop an improved fast Gauss transform to efficiently estimate sums of Gaussians in higher dimensions, where a new multivariate expansion scheme and an adaptive space subdivision technique dramatically improve the performance.

Based on these results, a simple defect model is proposed that can explain the complex behavior of the V/sub T/ instability in terms of structural defects as follows. 1) A defect band in the HfO/sub 2/ layer is located in energy above the Si conduction band edge. 2) The defect band shifts rapidly in energy with respect to the Fermi level in the Si substrate as the gate bias is varied. 3) The rapid energy shifts allows for efficient charging and discharging of the defects near the SiO/sub 2//HfO/sub 2/ interface by tunneling.","1558-0563","","10.1109/LED.2003.808844","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1196025","","Threshold voltage;Hafnium oxide;Current measurement;Dielectric measurements;CMOS technology;Stability;Capacitance measurement;Charge pumps;Stress;Charge measurement","silicon compounds;hafnium compounds;dielectric thin films;MOSFET;MOS capacitors;semiconductor device models;Fermi level;electron traps","threshold voltage instability;SiO/sub 2//HfO/sub 2/;dual layer gate dielectrics;MOSFETs;MOS capacitors;measurement sequence;time-resolved measurements;capacitance-time traces;charge-pumping measurements;defect model;structural defects;Fermi level;tunneling;SiO/sub 2/-HfO/sub 2/-Si","","287","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We describe the details of our approach and show applications in the proximal femur, the knee, and the skull. The accuracy of the determination of geometrical parameters was analyzed using CT scans of the semi-anthropomorphic European spine phantom. Depending on the settings of the segmentation parameters cortical thickness could be determined with an accuracy corresponding to the side length of 1 to 2.5 voxels. The impact of noise on the segmentation was investigated by artificially adding noise to the CT data. An increase in noise by factors of two and five changed cortical thickness corresponding to the side length of one voxel. Intraoperator and interoperator precision was analyzed by repeated analysis of nine pelvic CT scans. Precision errors were smaller than 1% for trabecular and total volumes and smaller than 2% for cortical thickness. Intraoperator and interoperator precision errors were not significantly different.

The launch of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Earth Observing 1 Hyperion sensor in November 2000 marked the establishment of a test bed for spaceborne hyperspectral capabilities. Hyperion covers the 0.4-2.5-/spl mu/m range with 242 spectral bands at approximately 10-nm spectral resolution and 30-m spatial resolution. Analytical Imaging and Geophysics LLC and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation have been involved in efforts to evaluate, validate, and demonstrate Hyperions's utility for geologic mapping in a variety of sites in the United States and around the world. Initial results over several sites with established ground truth and years of airborne hyperspectral data show that Hyperion data from the shortwave infrared spectrometer can be used to produce useful geologic (mineralogic) information. Minerals mapped include carbonates, chlorite, epidote, kaolinite, alunite, buddingtonite, muscovite, hydrothermal silica, and zeolite. Hyperion data collected under optimum conditions (summer season, bright targets, well-exposed geology) indicate that Hyperion data meet prelaunch specifications and allow subtle distinctions such as determining the difference between calcite and dolomite and mapping solid solution differences in micas caused by substitution in octahedral molecular sites. Comparison of airborne hyperspectral data [from the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS)] to the Hyperion data establishes that Hyperion provides similar basic mineralogic information, with the principal limitation being limited mapping of fine spectral detail under less-than-optimum acquisition conditions (winter season, dark targets) based on lower signal-to-noise ratios. Case histories demonstrate the analysis methodologies and level of information available from the Hyperion data. They also show the viability of Hyperion as a means of extending hyperspectral mineral mapping to areas not accessible to aircraft sensors.

We propose a method to accurately classify ECG arrhythmias through a combination of wavelets and artificial neural networks (ANN). The ability of the wavelet transform to decompose signal at various resolutions allows accurate extraction/detection of features from non-stationary signals like ECG. A set of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients, which contain the maximum information about the arrhythmia, is selected from the wavelet decomposition. These coefficients are fed to the back-propagation neural network which classifies the arrhythmias. The proposed method is capable of distinguishing the normal sinus rhythm and 12 different arrhythmias and is robust against noise.

The peak values of sub-image phase correlation surfaces reveal reliable local motion vectors, as poorly matched sub images result in considerably lower peaks in the phase correlation surface due to spread. The utilization of sub-images enables fast implementation of phase correlation based motion estimation.

The utility of this technique is demonstrated by considering an example consisting of a nine-element conformal array of microstrip patch antennas mounted axially along a finite-length PEC circular cylinder. It is shown that the elements close to the ends of the cylinder have significantly different patterns than those close to the center of the cylinder. The results from this example suggest that the common practice where all the individual element patterns are assumed identical is not always valid and, in fact, can lead to significant performance degradation in the design of conformal phased arrays. This observation is supported by the fact that an attempt to steer the main beam of the nine-element conformal array to an angle /spl theta//sub 0/=60/spl deg/ using a standard uniform progressive phase shifting technique proves unsuccessful. Next a genetic algorithm (GA) synthesis procedure is introduced that is capable of determining the optimal set of element excitation phases required to yield a desired or specified far-field radiation pattern. The results of this GA phase-only optimization are shown to yield the desired main beam steered to the correct angle for this nine-element linear array mounted on a circularly cylindrical platform. The GA radiation pattern synthesis procedure introduced appears to be a highly effective means of correcting for platform effects on the individual element patterns of a conformal phased array.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2003.811510","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1208512","","Antenna radiation patterns;Antenna arrays;Genetic algorithms;Phased arrays;Microstrip antennas;Microstrip antenna arrays;Patch antennas;Least squares methods;Simulated annealing;Computational modeling","antenna phased arrays;linear antenna arrays;conformal antennas;antenna radiation patterns;genetic algorithms;conductors (electric);microstrip antenna arrays","radiation pattern synthesis;conformal antenna arrays;three-dimensional platforms;genetic algorithms;domain-decomposition/reciprocity procedure;antenna radiation patterns;3D perfectly electric conducting platforms;3D PEC platforms;microstrip patch antennas;finite-length PEC circular cylinder;conformal phased arrays;uniform progressive phase shifting;genetic algorithm;element excitation phases;far-field radiation pattern;GA phase-only optimization;main beam steering;nine-element linear array;circularly cylindrical platform;conformal phased array","","49","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since not many MANETs are currently deployed, research in this area is mostly simulation based. Random waypoint is the commonly used mobility model in these simulations. Random waypoint is a simple model that may be applicable to some scenarios. However, we believe that it is not sufficient to capture some important mobility characteristics of scenarios in which MANETs may be deployed. Our framework aims to evaluate the impact of different mobility models on the performance of MANET routing protocols. We propose various protocol independent metrics to capture interesting mobility characteristics, including spatial and temporal dependence and geographic restrictions. In addition, a rich set of parameterized mobility models is introduced including random waypoint, group mobility, freeway and Manhattan models. Based on these models several 'test-suite' scenarios are chosen carefully to span the metric space. We demonstrate the utility of our test-suite by evaluating various MANET routing protocols, including DSR, AODV and DSDV. Our results show that the protocol performance may vary drastically across mobility models and performance rankings of protocols may vary with the mobility models used. This effect can be explained by the interaction of the mobility characteristics with the connectivity graph properties. Finally, we attempt to decompose the routing protocols into mechanistic ""building blocks"" to gain a deeper insight into the performance variations across protocols in the face of mobility.","0743-166X","0-7803-7752-4","10.1109/INFCOM.2003.1208920","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1208920","","Performance analysis;Routing protocols;Mobile ad hoc networks;Traffic control;Wireless communication;Computer science;Mobile computing;Testing;Performance gain;Telecommunication traffic","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols","routing protocol performance;mobile ad hoc network;wireless mobile node;random waypoint;parameterized mobility model impact;protocol independent metric;spatial dependence;temporal dependence;geographic restriction;group mobility;freeway model;Manhattan model;DSR;AODV;DSDV;connectivity graph property;scenario mobility characteristics;test-suite scenario","","475","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

PMMA with different molecular weights (MW 100 K, MW 495 K, MW 950 K) in anisole casting solvent has been crosslinked with different electron beam irradiation levels ranging from 20 C/m2 to 240 C/m2. This is to investigate the quantifiable relationship between electron dose and its submicrometer remaining thickness after dissolving in acetone. This technique which uses electron beam lithography, offers a high resolution semi-three-dimensional (3-D) nanomachining of the sacrificial layer in a single run. Because of its low Young's modulus, it has been successfully integrated with nanoelectromechanical systems processing and has the advantage of producing low-stress submicrometer thick structures with lateral dimensions as low as, but not limited to 1 μm. A fast dry release time from 55 to 100 s using oxygen plasma ashing has been demonstrated for a sacrificial layer aspect ratio of 125. This corresponds to an etch rate of about 0.6 μm/s at an average temperature of 40°C. The success of using cross-linked PMMA as a gate dielectric is demonstrated by the fabrication of multilayered gated lateral quantum dot devices.

In their case, the active and reactive powers replace the torque and flux amplitude used as the controlled outputs in DTC, thus motivating the name DPC-control. They show that a simple modification to the original algorithm makes the selection of the control inputs more accurate.

Proceedings of the","","2003","","","10 pp.","","By its very nature, software development consists of many knowledge-intensive processes. One of the most difficult to model, however, is requirements elicitation. This paper presents a mathematical model of the requirements elicitation process that clearly shows the critical role of knowledge in its performance. One meta-process of requirements elicitation, selection of an appropriate elicitation technique, is also captured in the model. The values of this model are: (1) improved understanding of what needs to be performed during elicitation helps analysts improve their elicitation efforts, (2) improved understanding of how elicitation techniques are selected helps less experienced analysts be as successful as more experienced analysts, and (3) as we improve our ability to perform elicitation, we improve the likelihood that the systems we create meet their intended customers' needs. Many papers have been written that promulgate specific elicitation methods. A few have been written that model elicitation in general. However, none have yet to model elicitation in a way that makes clear the critical role played by knowledge. This paper's model captures the critical roles played by knowledge in both elicitation and elicitation technique selection.","","0-7695-1874-5","10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174229","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174229","","Programming;Performance analysis;Writing;Springs;Mathematical model;Knowledge based systems;Documentation;Software systems","software engineering;user centred design;formal specification","requirements elicitation;elicitation technique selection;knowledge-intensive processes;software development","","49","","51","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two components of the field flux are produced. One, which is almost constant, is produced by the permanent magnet located on the rotor surface. The other, which is variable, is produced by a field winding positioned circumferentially in the center of the stator. These two flux components converge in the air gap. The excitation level of the machine is manipulated by controlling the DC field current. Three-dimensional finite-element analysis and experimental results demonstrate that it is possible to vary the flux over a wide range to keep the terminal voltage constant as the speed increases.

Both stages are based on fuzzy rules which make use of membership functions. The filter can be applied iteratively to effectively reduce heavy noise. In particular, the shape of the membership functions is adapted according to the remaining noise level after each iteration, making use of the distribution of the homogeneity in the image. A statistical model for the noise distribution can be incorporated to relate the homogeneity to the adaptation scheme of the membership functions.

Standard orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, using a guard-time interval or cyclic prefix, combat intersymbol interference (ISI), but provide no protection against interchannel interference (ICI). This drawback has led to the introduction of pulse-shaping OFDM systems. We first present a general framework for pulse shape design. Our analysis shows that certain pulse shapes proposed in the literature are, in fact, optimal in a well-defined sense. Furthermore, our approach provides a simple way to adapt the pulse shape to varying channel conditions. We then show that (pulse-shaping) OFDM systems based on rectangular time-frequency lattices are not optimal for time- and frequency-dispersive wireless channels. This motivates the introduction of lattice-OFDM (LOFDM) systems which are based on general time-frequency lattices. Using results from sphere packing theory, we show how to design LOFDM systems (lattice and pulse shape) optimally for timeand frequency-dispersive channels in order to minimize the joint ISI/ICI. Our theoretical analysis is confirmed by numerical simulations, showing that LOFDM systems outperform traditional pulse-shaping OFDM systems with respect to robustness against ISI/ICI.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2003.814200","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1214833","","OFDM;Time frequency analysis;Dispersion;Intersymbol interference;Pulse shaping methods;Shape;Lattices;Doppler effect;Frequency division multiplexing;Protection","OFDM modulation;dispersive channels;intersymbol interference;adjacent channel interference;multipath channels;pulse shaping;minimisation","pulse-shaping OFDM;dispersive channels;time dispersion;multipath propagation;frequency dispersion;Doppler effect;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;intersymbol interference;ISI;interchannel interference;ICI;pulse shape design;rectangular time-frequency lattices;lattice-OFDM;sphere packing theory","","187","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper describes the preliminary research and implementation of a fuzzy logic based controller to control the wheel slip for electric vehicle antilock braking systems (ABSs). As the dynamics of the braking systems are highly nonlinear and time variant, fuzzy control offers potential as an important tool for development of robust traction control. Simulation studies are employed to derive an initial rule base that is then tested on an experimental test facility representing the dynamics of a braking system. The test facility is composed of an induction machine load operating in the generating region. It is shown that the torque-slip characteristics of an induction motor provides a convenient platform for simulating a variety of tire/road /spl mu/-/spl sigma/ driving conditions, negating the initial requirement for skid-pan trials when developing algorithms. The fuzzy membership functions were subsequently refined by analysis of the data acquired from the test facility while simulating operation at a high coefficient of friction. The robustness of the fuzzy-logic slip regulator is further tested by applying the resulting controller over a wide range of operating conditions. The results indicate that ABS/traction control may substantially improve longitudinal performance and offer significant potential for optimal control of driven wheels, especially under icy conditions where classical ABS/traction control schemes are constrained to operate very conservatively.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2003.815922","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232699","","Fuzzy control;Electric vehicles;Control systems;Nonlinear control systems;Test facilities;Optimal control;Wheels;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Vehicle dynamics;Robust control","braking;fuzzy control;electric vehicles;traction motors;asynchronous machines;controllers;optimal control","fuzzy control algorithms;electric vehicle;antilock braking/traction control systems;nonlinear time-variant systems;research;fuzzy logic based controller;antilock braking systems;robust traction control;simulation;nonlinear dynamics;experimental test facility;induction machine load;torque-slip characteristics;induction motor;fuzzy membership functions;high coefficient of friction;fuzzy-logic slip regulator;operating conditions;ABS/traction control;longitudinal performance;optimal control;icy conditions;driven wheels","","89","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The approach is to start from one or more initial, low-order estimates that are only accurate in small image regions, called bootstrap regions. In each bootstrap region, the algorithm iteratively: 1) refines the transformation estimate using constraints only from within the bootstrap region; 2) expands the bootstrap region; and 3) tests to see if a higher order transformation model can be used, stopping when the region expands to cover the overlap between images. Steps 1): and 3), the bootstrap steps, are governed by the covariance matrix of the estimated transformation. Estimation refinement [Step 2)] uses a novel robust version of the ICP algorithm. In registering retinal image pairs, Dual-Bootstrap ICP is initialized by automatically matching individual vascular landmarks, and it aligns images based on detected blood vessel centerlines. The resulting quadratic transformations are accurate to less than a pixel. On tests involving approximately 6000 image pairs, it successfully registered 99.5% of the pairs containing at least one common landmark, and 100% of the pairs containing at least one common landmark and at least 35% image overlap.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2003.819276","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1242341","","Iterative closest point algorithm;Retina;Image registration;Iterative algorithms;Testing;Image analysis;Algorithm design and analysis;Covariance matrix;Robustness;Blood vessels","eye;medical image processing;iterative methods;image registration;covariance matrices;blood vessels;image matching","dual-bootstrap iterative closest point algorithm;retinal image registration;covariance matrix;estimation refinement;individual vascular landmarks;image alignment;image matching;blood vessel centerlines;quadratic transformations","Algorithms;Fluorescein Angiography;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Retina;Retinal Diseases;Retinal Vessels;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","228","","88","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An implementation scheme for normal convolution and for recursive filtering is proposed. Also directed derivative filters are demonstrated. For the recursive implementation, filtering an 512 /spl times/ 512 image is performed within 40 msec on a current state of the art PC, gaining over 3 times in performance for a typical filter, independent of the standard deviations and orientation of the filter. Accuracy of the filters is still reasonable when compared to truncation error or recursive approximation error. The anisotropic Gaussian filtering method allows fast calculation of edge and ridge maps, with high spatial and angular accuracy. For tracking applications, the normal anisotropic convolution scheme is more advantageous, with applications in the detection of dashed lines in engineering drawings. The recursive implementation is more attractive in feature detection applications, for instance in affine invariant edge and ridge detection in computer vision. The proposed computational filtering method enables the practical applicability of orientation scale-space analysis.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2003.812429","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1217270","","Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Gaussian processes;Filters;Filtering;Application software;Convolution;Computer vision;Image edge detection;Finite wordlength effects;Approximation error","filtering theory;recursive filters;edge detection;feature extraction;convolution","anisotropic Gaussian decomposition;fast anisotropic Gauss filtering;1D Gauss filter;nonorthogonal direction;recursive filtering;directed derivative filters;image filtering;standard deviation;filter orientation;truncation error;recursive approximation error;anisotropic Gaussian filtering method;edge maps;ridge maps;high spatial accuracy;high angular accuracy;tracking applications;anisotropic convolution;dashed lines detection;engineering drawings;feature detection;affine invariant edge detection;affine invariant ridge detection;computer vision;computational filtering method;orientation scale-space analysis","","188","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A review of the available literature led to the conclusion that the limitations inherent in the Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits had not been adequately examined, and this led to the investigation that is reported on in this paper. The Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits are useful in the reduction of the equivalent circuit for a transmitting-receiving antenna system to simpler networks that facilitate the evaluation of the received power. One finds in the literature that the calculated power dissipation within these equivalent circuits is often equated to the reradiated and scattered power from the receiving antenna. Such calculations are not correct, because power dissipation in the network from which the Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits were obtained cannot be made using the Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits. However, as we will show, the Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits can be used to find a reradiated electromagnetic field that is a part of the total field scattered by a receiving antenna. As part of the derivation of this new result, we develop a derivation of the Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits from the basic principles of uniqueness and superposition applied to electromagnetic fields.","1558-4143","","10.1109/MAP.2003.1203128","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1203128","","Equivalent circuits;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Loaded antennas;Impedance;Electromagnetic scattering;Transmission line antennas;Antennas and propagation;Electromagnetic fields;Propagation losses","equivalent circuits;receiving antennas;antenna theory","Thevenin equivalent circuits;Norton equivalent circuits;receiving antenna;electromagnetic fields","","58","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

A decorrelation transformation is then applied to speech samples to approximate their multivariate distribution. To do this, speech is decomposed using an adaptive Karhunen-Loeve transform or a discrete cosine transform. Then, the distributions of speech components in decorrelated domains are investigated.

A two-cell interleaved boost converter with coupled inductors is used to match the photovoltaic system to the load and to operate the solar cell array at maximum power point. A maximum power point tracking algorithm is developed using only load voltage information, eliminating the array current detection. The present converter system has the advantages of low ripple content, both on the load and source side, improved efficiency and reduced switch stress, as compared to noncoupled two-cell interleaved converters. As a result, a lower value of array capacitance is sufficient for smoothing the array voltage and current. Analytical expressions for the photovoltaic source and interleaved boost converter, corresponding to maximum power point operation of the SCA, are derived. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the suitability of this converter system. Few experimental observations are also presented for partial shading conditions. Further, a comparative study of coupled and noncoupled interleaved boost converters for photovoltaic applications is made. These studies reveal that, by introducing coupling among the parallel branch inductors, it is possible to improve steady-state performance while maintaining the dynamic performance of the photovoltaic system.","1350-2352","","10.1049/ip-epa:20020686","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1192301","","","photovoltaic power systems;DC-DC power convertors;power system control;optimal control;power inductors;load (electric);solar cell arrays;control system synthesis","coupled inductor interleaved boost converter;maximum power point tracking;PV power systems;photovoltaic generator;nonlinear voltage-current characteristics;array current detection;low ripple content;switch stress;array voltage smoothing;array current smoothing;partial shading conditions;steady-state performance;dynamic performance","","45","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals"

Since conventional software-based algorithms for string matching have not kept pace with high network speeds, specialized high-speed, hardware-based solutions are needed. We describe a technique based on Bloom filters for detecting predefined signatures (a string of bytes) in the packet payload. A Bloom filter is a data structure for representing a set of strings in order to support membership queries. We use hardware Bloom filters to isolate all packets that potentially contain predefined signatures. Another independent process eliminates false positives produced by Bloom filters.

It is well known that the distribution of face images, under a perceivable variation in viewpoint, illumination or facial expression, is highly nonlinear and complex. It is, therefore, not surprising that linear techniques, such as those based on principle component analysis (PCA) or linear discriminant analysis (LDA), cannot provide reliable and robust solutions to those FR problems with complex face variations. In this paper, we propose a kernel machine-based discriminant analysis method, which deals with the nonlinearity of the face patterns' distribution. The proposed method also effectively solves the so-called ""small sample size"" (SSS) problem, which exists in most FR tasks. The new algorithm has been tested, in terms of classification error rate performance, on the multiview UMIST face database. Results indicate that the proposed methodology is able to achieve excellent performance with only a very small set of features being used, and its error rate is approximately 34% and 48% of those of two other commonly used kernel FR approaches, the kernel-PCA (KPCA) and the generalized discriminant analysis (GDA), respectively.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2002.806629","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176132","","Face recognition;Kernel;Algorithm design and analysis;Linear discriminant analysis;Error analysis;Lighting;Principal component analysis;Robustness;Pattern analysis;Testing","face recognition;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;principal component analysis","face recognition;kernel direct discriminant analysis algorithms;low-dimensional feature representation;discriminatory power;principle component analysis;linear discriminant analysis;classification error rate performance;multiview UMIST face database;generalized discriminant analysis","","412","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown that single-phase asymmetrical short circuit faults produce more severe fault responses with high pulsating torque and a significant threat of rotor demagnetization. A control strategy that purposely transitions such faults into symmetrical three-phase short circuits can minimize the fault severity and associated demagnetization risks.

Grouping the elements of a phased array into a number of partially overlapped subarrays and using a single phase shifter for each subarray, generally results in a considerable reduction in array size and manufacturing costs. However, overlapped subarrays require complicated corporate feed networks and array architectures that cannot be easily implemented using planar technologies. In this paper a novel feed network and array architecture for implementing a planar phased array of microstrip antennas is presented that enables the fabrication of low-sidelobe, compact, beam-steerable millimeter-wave arrays and facilitates integration of the RF front-end electronics with the antenna structure. This design uses a combination of series and parallel feeding schemes to achieve the desired array coefficients. The proposed approach is used to design a three-state switched-beam phased array with a scanning width of /spl plusmn/10/spl deg/. This phased array which is composed of 80 microstrip elements, achieves a gain of >20 dB, a sidelobe level of <-19 dB and a 10-dB bandwidth of >6.3% for all states of the beam. The antenna efficiency is measured at 33-36% in X band. It is shown that the proposed feeding scheme is insensitive to the mutual coupling among the elements.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2003.816331","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1229887","","Phased arrays;Microstrip antenna arrays;Microstrip antennas;Millimeter wave technology;Fabrication;Antenna feeds;Antenna arrays;Phase shifters;Manufacturing;Costs","millimetre wave antenna arrays;beam steering;planar antenna arrays;antenna phased arrays;antenna feeds;microstrip antenna arrays;antenna radiation patterns;scanning antennas;millimetre wave phase shifters","millimeter-wave antenna;beam-steerable antenna;interleaved planar subarrays;phased array elements;feed network;array architecture;microstrip antennas;low-sidelobe arrays;compact arrays;series feeding;parallel feeding;three-state phased array;switched-beam phased array;scanning width;antenna efficiency;X band;partially overlapped subarrays;phase shifter","","71","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, a folded-flexure suspension consisting of two folded beams rather than four and a U-shaped shuttle allowed the actuator area to be cut in half without degrading its performance. Second, the comb teeth were designed with linearly increasing lengths to reduce side instability by a factor of two. Third, the folded-flexure suspensions were fabricated in an initially bent configuration, improving the suspension stiffness ratio and reducing side instability by an additional factor of 30. Finally, additional actuation range was achieved using a launch and capture actuation scheme in which the actuator was allowed to swing backward after full forward deflection; the shuttle was captured and held using the backs of the comb banks as high-force, parallel-plate actuators.","1941-0158","","10.1109/JMEMS.2003.811750","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1203772","","Electrostatic actuators;Etching;Silicon;Teeth;Micromechanical devices;Drives;Voltage;Resonant frequency;Degradation;Pneumatic actuators","electrostatic actuators;sputter etching;elemental semiconductors;silicon;semiconductor device measurement","large deflection electrostatic actuators;comb-drive actuators;displacements;nonlinear model;resonant frequency;stable deflection;deep reactive ion etched silicon;actuator design;folded-flexure suspension;U-shaped shuttle;linearly increasing lengths;side instability;suspension stiffness ratio;launch and capture actuation scheme;0 to 150 micron;Si","","146","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Transconductance and output conductance are two dominant nonlinear sources of CMOS. At a low frequency, the transconductance is a dominant nonlinear source for a low load impedance, but for a usual operation level impedance the output conductance is a dominant nonlinear source. Capacitances and the substrate network do not generate any significant nonlinearity, but they suppress output-conductance nonlinearity at a high frequency because output impedance is reduced by the capacitive shunts, and output voltage swing is also reduced. Therefore, above 2-3 GHz, the transconductance becomes a dominant nonlinear source for a usual load impedance. If these capacitive elements are tuned out for a power match, the behavior becomes similar to the low-frequency case. As gate length is reduced, the transconductance becomes more linear, but the output conductance becomes more nonlinear. At a low frequency, CMOS linearity is degraded as the gate length becomes shorter, but at a higher frequency (above 2-3 GHz), linearity can be improved.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2003.808709","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1191756","","Linearity;Radio frequency;Transconductance;Impedance;Taylor series;Capacitance;Semiconductor device modeling;Voltage;CMOS technology;Microwave technology","CMOS integrated circuits;radiofrequency integrated circuits;series (mathematics);integrated circuit modelling;circuit simulation","CMOS;linearity analysis;RF application;Taylor series;output conductance;transconductance;nonlinear sources;load impedance;operation level impedance;BSIM3-based model;capacitive shunts;power match;gate length;2 to 3 GHz","","94","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Inst., San Francisco, CA, USA; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","","2003","25","1","57","74","We formulate edge detection as statistical inference. This statistical edge detection is data driven, unlike standard methods for edge detection which are model based. For any set of edge detection filters (implementing local edge cues), we use presegmented images to learn the probability distributions of filter responses conditioned on whether they are evaluated on or off an edge. Edge detection is formulated as a discrimination task specified by a likelihood ratio test on the filter responses. This approach emphasizes the necessity of modeling the image background (the off-edges). We represent the conditional probability distributions nonparametrically and illustrate them on two different data sets of 100 (Sowerby) and 50 (South Florida) images. Multiple edges cues, including chrominance and multiple-scale, are combined by using their joint distributions. Hence, this cue combination is optimal in the statistical sense. We evaluate the effectiveness of different visual cues using the Chernoff information and Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves. This shows that our approach gives quantitatively better results than the Canny edge detector when the image background contains significant clutter. In addition, it enables us to determine the effectiveness of different edge cues and gives quantitative measures for the advantages of multilevel processing, for the use of chrominance, and for the relative effectiveness of different detectors. Furthermore, we show that we can learn these conditional distributions on one data set and adapt them to the other with only slight degradation of performance without knowing the ground truth on the second data set. This shows that our results are not purely domain specific. We apply the same approach to the spatial grouping of edge cues and obtain analogies to nonmaximal suppression and hysteresis.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2003.1159946","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1159946","","Image edge detection;Detectors;Object detection;Gabor filters;Probability distribution;Testing;Statistical distributions;Degradation;Hysteresis;Statistical learning","edge detection;computer vision;Bayes methods;inference mechanisms","edge detection;statistical inference;statistical learning;performance analysis;Bayesian inference;Receiver Operator Characteristic curves;Chernoff information;conditional probability distributions","","189","","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The paper proposes a simple and efficient automatic gait recognition algorithm using statistical shape analysis. For each image sequence, an improved background subtraction procedure is used to extract moving silhouettes of a walking figure from the background. Temporal changes of the detected silhouettes are then represented as an associated sequence of complex vector configurations in a common coordinate frame, and are further analyzed using the Procrustes shape analysis method to obtain mean shape as gait signature. Supervised pattern classification techniques, based on the full Procrustes distance measure, are adopted for recognition. This method does not directly analyze the dynamics of gait, but implicitly uses the action of walking to capture the structural characteristics of gait, especially the shape cues of body biometrics. The algorithm is tested on a database consisting of 240 sequences from 20 different subjects walking at 3 viewing angles in an outdoor environment.

The analysis proceeds by replacing the existing parallel resonant tank and rectifier circuit with a DC source and transformer equivalent, thereby reducing the complexity of the circuit, and eliminating the diodes. The DC equivalent is shown to have the same energy storage and power capability as the original circuit and is accurate under all loadings for both transient and steady-state conditions. With this simplification, analytic transfer functions for the pick-up with respect to its excitation current and its control switch duty cycle are developed. The ICPT system model is shown to have multiple poles, with complex zeroes on the right half plane.

In the MIMO system, forward error correction coding is essential for high quality communications. Recently, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes have attracted much attention as good error correcting codes like turbo codes. LDPC codes have been applied to MIMO systems, where we refer to the system as the MIMO-LDPC. In this paper, we propose a new MIMO-LDPC system with iterative turbo decoding (MIMO-LDPC-TD) using two LDPC encoders and two LDPC decoders to improve the performance of the MIMO-LDPC. Since each decoder in the MIMO-LDPC-TD is smaller than that in the MIMO-LDPC, the decoding complexity at each decoder in the MIMO-LDPC-TD is less than that in the MIMO-LDPC.

Mechanical stress is the main cause of long-term drift and packaging-induced inaccuracy in bandgap voltage references. Especially, low-cost epoxy packaging can cause a large mechanical stress, being in the range from -200 to +200 MPa. This stress shows local variations over the chip area and changes over time or during thermal cycling. Due to the piezojunction effect, this stress causes changes and drift in the base-emitter voltages of bipolar transistors and consequently in the output voltage of bandgap references.

Position and time data can be acquired in a variety of ways including probe vehicles, embedded road sensors, tagging electronic toll collection transponders, automatic vehicle location (AVL) systems, etc. As part of advanced public transportation systems, many transit agencies are placing AVL systems on their buses to better manage their fleet and to provide their passengers with better information on vehicle arrivals and departures. Another public transport system that can benefit from this technology is shared-use vehicle systems (i.e., car-sharing, station cars). In particular, multiple-station shared-use vehicle systems need to manage their fleet closely to avoid vehicle distribution problems at their stations. In this paper, we describe a route prediction and time-of-arrival estimation methodology that has been implemented with a real-world multiple-station car-sharing system. Each vehicle has A VL hardware, producing position and time data that can be used at the system level for estimation. This is slightly different than bus arrival estimation techniques in that the routes are not known a priori. The developed algorithm was tested against actual routes and arrival times, producing encouraging results. It was determined that the estimation procedure could be improved if the frequency of position/time data was increased.","","0-7803-7848-2","10.1109/IVS.2003.1212964","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1212964","","Time of arrival estimation;Intelligent transportation systems;Intelligent sensors;Road vehicles;Frequency estimation;Intelligent vehicles;Information management;Probes;Sensor systems;Tagging","traffic information systems;road traffic;traffic control;intelligent sensors","vehicle route prediction;arrival time estimation;intelligent transportation system management;automatic vehicle location;AVL;shared use vehicle systems;multiple station car sharing system","","34","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The most popular technique, k-means clustering, however, has two inherent limitations: the clusters are constrained to be spherically symmetric and their number has to be known a priori. In nonparametric clustering methods, like the one based on mean shift, these limitations are eliminated but the amount of computation becomes prohibitively large as the dimension of the space increases. We exploit a recently proposed approximation technique, locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), to reduce the computational complexity of adaptive mean shift. In our implementation of LSH the optimal parameters of the data structure are determined by a pilot learning procedure, and the partitions are data driven. As an application, the performance of mode and k-means based textons are compared in a texture classification study.","","0-7695-1950-4","10.1109/ICCV.2003.1238382","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1238382","","Computer vision;Space technology;Computational complexity;Clustering algorithms;Robustness;Computer science;Industrial engineering;Technology management;Engineering management;Clustering methods","image texture;pattern clustering;image classification;computer vision;feature extraction","mean shift based clustering;texture classification;feature space analysis;computer vision","","239","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the problem of detecting deterministic signals in additive Gaussian noise, we show that having a set of identical binary sensors is asymptotically optimal, as the number of observations per sensor goes to infinity.

In addition, new but compact expressions for the complementary field coefficients can be obtained after quite lengthy mathematical manipulations. Three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations of surface emission from Gaussian rough surfaces were used to examine the validity of the model. The results based on the new version (advanced IEM) indicate that significant improvements for emissivity prediction may be obtained for a wide range of roughness scales, in particular in the intermediate roughness regions.

A major feature for this new architecture is the use of a shared transmission media between all users; hence, medium access control arbitration mechanisms are essential for the successful implementation of EPON: i.e., to ensure a contention-free transmission and provide end users with equal access to the shared media. We propose to use the multipoint control protocol defined by the IEEE 802.3ah task force to arbitrate the transmission of different users, and we present different dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) algorithms to allocate bandwidths effectively and fairly between end users. These DBA algorithms are also augmented to support differentiated services, a crucial requirement for a converged broadband access network with heterogeneous traffic. We show that queueing delays under strict bandwidth allocation algorithms result in an unexpected behavior for certain traffic classes, and we suggest the use of DBA with appropriate local queue management to alleviate this inappropriate behavior.

The most active areas for high frequency applications include Bluetooth module, front end module (FEM) of mobile phones, wireless local access network (WLAN). Local multipoint distribution system (LMDS) and collision avoidance radar etc. The recent development of LTCC substrate material extend the applicable frequency of the technique up to 100GHz. Owing to the feature of low conductor loss, low substrate loss, and up to 50 laminated layers, LTCC provide a harmonic bed for embedded microwave and mm wave passive components and accessories including antennas. In addition, LTCC substrate material has a wide tuneable range of thermal expansion coefficient. It is this feature that makes the LTCC substrate very attractive for various integrated packaging. In the presentation, the present status of the technology will be reviewed, from its manufacturing process, material properties to RF and microwave performance of typical LTCC modules. The LTCC market projection and cost issue will be also discussed to have a globe view of the technology. A large number of practical examples for high frequency applications will be followed to display the current technology status. The examples include, but not limited to, (1) RF front end module for mobile phones, (2) antennas for WLAN and Bluetooth devices, (3) laminated waveguide and other new form of transmission lines for mm wave applications, (4) integrated mm wave antenna arrays, and (5) Integrated RF modules such as high performance VCO. balanced LNA, miniaturized RF filters and balun. Since the most challenge issue in LTCC module designs is the integrated passives, the emphasis of the examples will be placed on the embedded passives and system integration. Some practical LTCC modules developed in The Chinese University of Hong Kong are listed in the following. The details of these modules can be found in the listed references and will be further elaborated in the presentation.","","0-7803-7831-8","10.1109/ISAPE.2003.1276790","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1276790","","Radio frequency;Conducting materials;Bluetooth;Mobile handsets;Wireless LAN;Mobile antennas;Transmission line antennas;Millimeter wave technology;Temperature;Ceramics","ceramics;substrates","LTCC technology;high frequency front end modules;low temperature co-fired ceramic technique;microwave frequency band;millimetre wave frequency band;Bluetooth module;mobile phones;wireless local access network;local multipoint distribution system;collision avoidance radar;conductor loss;substrate loss;mm wave passive components;thermal expansion coefficient;RF front end module;integrated mm wave antenna arrays","","13","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Expanded Swerling target models","D. A. Shnidman","RADET Consulting, Lexington, MA, USA","IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","","2003","39","3","1059","1069","Radar target fluctuation models were first introduced by Swerling in the 1950s and they proved to be very useful. Swerling soon realized, however, that his original four models were inadequate and generalized them through use of the gamma distribution. These generalized results still had serious limitations in modeling fluctuating targets. For some targets the Swerling I correlated model produced an overly pessimistic value for P/sub D/ at large signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) while the Swerling III correlated model produced an overly optimistic one. As a result, other fluctuation models, such as the log-normal and Weibull, remain useful in spite of their own limitations. Two new models that expand on the generalized Swerling model are presented here. They are physically motivated and can produce the desired P/sub D/ levels at high SNR values. They are described in detail and both the moment generating functions (MGFs) and P/sub D/ expressions are determined. They provide a significant advance in our modeling capabilities through their flexibility for modeling many different types of target radar cross section (RCS) responses. These new models apply to both the case where the pulse-to-pulse target responses are correlated as well as the case where they are uncorrelated, thereby overcoming the limitations of the log-normal and Weibull models.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2003.1238757","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1238757","","Fluctuations;Radar cross section;Signal to noise ratio;Radar detection;Distributed computing;Density functional theory;Reflection;Gamma ray detection;Gamma ray detectors;Weibull distribution","radar theory;radar cross-sections;gamma distribution","Swerling model;radar target fluctuation;gamma distribution;signal-to-noise ratio;moment generating function;detection probability;radar cross-section","","36","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing business intelligence tools suffer from a lack of analysis and visualization capabilities and traditional result list display by search engines often overwhelms business analysts with irrelevant information. Thus, developing tools that enable better analysis while reduce information overload has been a challenge. The literature show that hierarchical and map displays enable effective access and browsing of information. However, they have not been widely applied to discover business intelligence on the Web. This research proposes business intelligence explorer, a tool implementing the steps in a knowledge map framework for discovering business intelligence on the Web. Two browsing methods, namely, Web community and knowledge map, have been implemented. Web community uses a genetic algorithm to organize different Web sites into a hierarchical format. Knowledge map uses a multidimensional scaling algorithm to place different Web sites as points on a map. Preliminary results of our user study show that Web community helps users locate results quickly and effectively. Users liked the intuitive map display of knowledge map. Our business intelligence explorer contributes to alleviate information overload in business analysis. Future directions on applying document visualization techniques in discovering business intelligence are described.","","0-7695-1874-5","10.1109/HICSS.2003.1173649","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1173649","","Information analysis;Visualization;Displays;Search engines;Management information systems;Web sites;Genetic algorithms;Multidimensional systems;Internet;Databases","knowledge management;competitive intelligence;Web sites;search engines;data mining;online front-ends;Internet","business intelligence explorer;knowledge map;business intelligence discovery;World Wide Web;information overload;information browsing;Web browsing;Web community;genetic algorithm;Web sites;multidimensional scaling algorithm;document visualization","","8","","57","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Applying software engineering techniques to the problem is a step in the right direction. However, software engineers need to be aware of the risks and security issues associated with the design, development, and deployment of network-based software.

Today's modeling environments usually offer a variant of what we call amorphous heterogeneity to address this problem. This paper argues that modeling systems in this manner leads to unexpected and hard-to-analyze interactions between the communication mechanisms and proposes a more structured approach to heterogeneity, called hierarchical heterogeneity, to solve this problem. It proposes a model structure and semantic framework that support this form of heterogeneity, and discusses the issues arising from heterogeneous component interaction and the desire for component reuse.

The converter control to output transfer function under continuous conduction mode operation and using voltage-mode control does not exhibit a second order pole associated with the output L-C filter, making it different from a conventional PWM converter. This new PSPWM converter model shows that the output L-C filter is separated into two real poles, with one pole held at constant frequency independent of operating conditions.

The normalized image of an image (object) is nearly invariant with respect to rotations. As a result, the watermark detection task can be much simplified when it is applied to the normalized image. However, because image normalization is sensitive to image local variation, we apply image normalization to nonoverlapped image disks separately. The disks are centered at the extracted feature points. Several copies of a 16-bit watermark sequence are embedded in the original image to improve the robustness of watermarks.

The available input voltage can be boosted for better current regulation, which is an advantage for low voltage applications. For operation with an AC supply, the SEPIC converter is designed to operate in the discontinuous conduction mode. In this operation mode, it approximates a voltage follower and the line current follows the line voltage waveform to a certain extent. The reduction in low-order harmonics and improved power factor is achieved without the use of any voltage or current sensors.

This paper discusses the influence of the dead time effect on the carrier signal excitation comparing alternating and revolving injection principles. To overcome disturbing effects an alternating injection procedure is proposed using a predefined injection angle. The approach reduces the effects of the inverter distortion voltages. As a result it is possible to track even small saliencies typical for surface mounted permanent magnet synchronous machines.

This expression has been used in the construction of an electrothermal model for the PA. Parameters for the new proposed behavior model were determined from the PA measurements obtained under different excitation conditions (e.g., small-signal and pulsed RF tests). This study led us to conclude that the effects of the transistor self-heating phenomenon are more important under narrow-band signal (e.g., enhanced data for global evolution of global system for mobile communications) than for signals with wide modulation bandwidth (CDMA2000, Universal Mobile Telecommunications System). In the second part of this paper, the newly developed model has also been used to design a temperature-compensated predistortion function to compensate for these effects. The linearized PA output spectrum and error vector magnitude show a significant performance improvement in the temperature-compensated predistortion function over a memoryless predistortion. The results of these measurements that have been conducted on a 90-W peak lateral double-diffused metal-oxide-semiconductor PA are in agreement with those obtained from simulations using the developed PA and the predistorter models implemented in an ADS environment.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2003.820157","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1256774","","Radio frequency;Power amplifiers;Radiofrequency amplifiers;Predistortion;Bandwidth;Pulse measurements;Operational amplifiers;Signal design;Circuits;RF signals","power amplifiers;linearisation techniques;compensation;distortion;3G mobile communication;code division multiple access","thermal memory effects modeling;RF power amplifiers;predistortion linearizers;modulation signal bandwidth;electrical nonlinearity effects;power amplifiers distortion generation;designing baseband predistortion;electrothermal model;transistor self-heating;wide modulation bandwidth;temperature-compensated predistortion function;error vector magnitude;CDMA;code division multiple access;90 W","","86","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An earlier version of the filter was presented at IROS 2001. Since then, the filter has been substantially improved. Real-time tracking of rigid body orientation is accomplished using the MARG (magnetic, angular rate, and gravity) sensors. A MARG sensor measures the three-dimensional local magnetic field, three-dimensional angular rate, and three-dimensional acceleration. A Kalman filter is designed to process measurements provided by the MARG sensors, and to produce real-time orientation represented in quaternions. There are many design decisions as related to choice of state vectors, output equations, process model, etc. The filter design presented in this paper utilizes the Gauss-Newton method for parameter optimization in conjunction with Kalman filtering. The use of the Gauss-Newton method, particularly the reduced-order implementation introduced in the paper, significantly simplifies the Kalman filter design, and reduces computational requirements.","","0-7803-7860-1","10.1109/IROS.2003.1248787","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1248787","","Magnetic separation;Magnetic sensors;Filters;Magnetic field measurement;Newton method;Least squares methods;Recursive estimation;Tracking;Humans;Gravity","Kalman filters;filtering theory;sensor fusion;magnetic sensors;real-time systems;tracking;gravity;Newton method;optimisation","quaternion-based Kalman filter;real-time tracking;rigid body orientation;magnetic sensor;angular rate sensor;gravity sensor;three-dimensional local magnetic field;three-dimensional angular rate;three-dimensional acceleration;Gauss-Newton method;parameter optimization","","27","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose a general epidemic threshold condition that applies to arbitrary graphs: we prove that, under reasonable approximations, the epidemic threshold for a network is closely related to the largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. Finally, for the last question, we show that infections tend to zero exponentially below the epidemic threshold. We show that our epidemic threshold model subsumes many known thresholds for special-case graphs (e.g., Erdos-Renyi, BA power-law, homogeneous); we show that the threshold tends to zero for infinite power-law graphs.

One of the challenging questions that retailers are facing in that respect is how to organize the logistic fulfillment processes during and after the transaction has taken place. Based on a survey of 55 online retailers (both traditional and Internet-only) this paper investigates the distribution strategies of these different retailer types. This includes the use of infrastructure not particularly designed for delivery to Internet customers like stores and store warehouses, the logistics outsourcing strategy and the company's choice of delivery area. The independent variables studied are the delivery lead times offered to customers, the assortment choice, the number of Internet customer orders and the company type (traditional retailer or not). It is argued and demonstrated that the distribution channel for Internet customers should be integrated with existing operations, but for larger Internet order volumes, traditional retailers should switch to direct-delivery distribution centers. The outsourcing and delivery area decision appear to be mainly determined by the complexity of the assortment.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2003.820135","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1261367","","Internet;Data processing","Internet;transaction processing;electronic commerce;distribution strategy;warehousing;outsourcing;customer relationship management;retail data processing;goods dispatch data processing","distribution strategy;e-commerce;online retailer;Internet customer;empirical research;outsourcing strategy;transaction process;store warehouse","","38","","47","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This graphical technique is confirmed for both alternative phase opposition disposition and phase disposition equivalent modulation of a cascaded inverter, and is then used to create reduced common-mode modulation strategies for cascaded inverters from their equivalent counterparts for diode-clamped inverters under both continuous and discontinuous switching conditions.

With this in mind, models of wind turbine units and wind farms are being developed for a commercial power system load flow and stability simulation package. All significant air-dynamical, mechanical, and electrical factors have been reviewed and are modeled appropriately.

In WMNs, similar to ad hoc networks, each user node operates not only as a host but also as a router; user packets are forwarded to and from an Internet-connected gateway in multihop fashion. The meshed topology provides good reliability, market coverage, and scalability, as well as low upfront investments. Despite the recent startup surge in WMNs, much research remains to be done before WMNs realize their full potential. This article tackles the problem of determining the exact capacity of a WMN. The key concept we introduce to enable this calculation is the bottleneck collision domain, defined as the geographical area of the network that bounds from above the amount of data that can be transmitted in the network. We show that for WMNs the throughput of each node decreases as O(1/n), where n is the total number of nodes in the network. In contrast with most existing work on ad hoc network capacity, we do not limit our study to the asymptotic case. In particular, for a given topology and the set of active nodes, we provide exact upper bounds on the throughput of any node. The calculation can be used to provision the network, to ensure quality of service and fairness.

To achieve this goal, the antenna for mobile sets must be small, flexible, and efficient. The capacitor-loaded patch, i.e., C-patch, antenna is one of the antennas that can achieve the goal of mobile communication devices. The C-patch antenna makes use of the capacitance to reduce the resonant frequency of the patch so that a small, arbitrarily shaped patch antenna can operate at proper frequencies. In previous studies, it was found that the size of ground plane has strong effects on the operation parameters of the traditional patch antenna. Although the C-patch antenna is a type of patch antenna, it is not clear whether the ground effect on the C-patch antenna is the same or not. To investigate the problem, a study of the ground plane effect on a rectangular C-patch antenna is presented in this paper. Like the traditional patch antenna, the C-patch antenna parameters are affected strongly by the ground plane effect. However, unlike the traditional patch antenna, the ground plane effect on the C-patch antenna is asymmetrical.","","0-7803-7846-6","10.1109/APS.2003.1219340","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1219340","","Patch antennas;Mobile antennas;Mobile communication;Resonant frequency;Shape;Capacitance;Microstrip antennas;Design engineering;Modems;Impedance","mobile antennas;microstrip antennas","rectangular C-patch antenna;finite ground plane effects;mobile communication antenna;mobile communication devices;capacitor-loaded patch antenna;resonant frequency reduction;asymmetrical ground plane effect","","4","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The results are illustrated with specific cases of simple time-delay cable and a high-Q factor resonator. It is shown that the behavior of the phase noise is similar to an oscillator locked to an external low phase-noise source. The output phase noise can be reduced at the noise offset frequency near the carrier frequency, and returning to the free-running oscillator noise far from the carrier frequency for certain stable feedback delay ranges. The phase-noise reduction is affected by the self-injection signal strength and feedback transfer function for different oscillator equivalent-circuit models. The theory is verified by using a self-injection-locked GaAs MESFET oscillator operating at the X-band with delay cable loops.

The cut ratio is defined as the ratio of the corresponding sums of two different weights of edges along the cut boundary and models the mean affinity between the segments separated by the boundary per unit boundary length. This new cost function allows the image perimeter to be segmented, guarantees that the segments produced by bipartitioning are connected, and does not introduce a size, shape, smoothness, or boundary-length bias. The latter allows it to produce segmentations where boundaries are aligned with image edges. Furthermore, the cut-ratio cost function allows efficient iterated region-based segmentation as well as pixel-based segmentation. These properties may be useful for some image-segmentation applications. While the problem of finding a minimum ratio cut in an arbitrary graph is NP-hard, one can find a minimum ratio cut in the connected planar graphs that arise during image segmentation in polynomial time. While the cut ratio, alone, is not sufficient as a baseline method for image segmentation, it forms a good basis for an extended method of image segmentation when combined with a small number of standard techniques. We present an implemented algorithm for finding a minimum ratio cut, prove its correctness, discuss its application to image segmentation, and present the results of segmenting a number of medical and natural images using our techniques.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2003.1201819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1201819","","Image segmentation;Cost function;Polynomials;Partitioning algorithms;Image edge detection;Pixel;Shape;Biomedical imaging;Machine vision;Weight measurement","image segmentation;computer vision;edge detection;graph theory;medical image processing","image segmentation;cost function;cut ratio;graph-based methods;image perimeter;bipartitioning;image edges;iterated region-based segmentation;pixel-based segmentation;NP-hard;minimum ratio;connected planar graphs;polynomial time;medical image processing;machine vision;edge detection","","168","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Faster than a speeding bullet train","P. Holmer","NA","IEEE Spectrum","","2003","40","8","30","34","China is throttling up a 430-km/h magnetically levitated train to link Shanghai and its airport. Built in China by a trio of German companies and the Shanghai Maglev Transportation Development Co., it reaches 430 km/h (268 mi/h)-130 km/h faster than Japan's famous bullet train. And even as it goes faster than any commercial vehicle without wings, the Chinese train is smoother and quieter than Amtrak's wheel-on-rail Acela-the state of the art in the United States-which pokes along when it can at a maximum 240 km/h. After many false starts and the completion of full-scale experimental maglev systems in Japan and Germany in the 1980s, maglev in China will finally start shuffling passengers in October in a reasonably large-scale, commercial system. The trains will run from downtown Shanghai's financial district to Pudong International Airport, making a 9-minute run that will shave about 40 minutes off the typical trip time in a taxi. With three five-car trains, each carrying as many as 574 passengers, and trains leaving every 10 minutes, the US $1.2 billion system could carry more than 10 million passengers a year.","1939-9340","","10.1109/MSPEC.2003.1222045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1222045","","Magnetic levitation;Costs;Control systems;Vehicle safety;Testing;Medical services;Airports;Air transportation;Rail transportation;Propulsion","railways;magnetic levitation","China;Shanghai Maglev Transportation Development Company;magnetically levitated train;Pudong International Airport;Shanghai financial district","","37","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The technique is a generalization of the existing Zelinski post-filter, which uses the auto- and cross-spectral densities of the array inputs to estimate the signal and noise spectral densities. The Zelinski technique, however, assumes zero cross-correlation between the noise on different sensors. This assumption is inaccurate, particularly at low frequencies and for arrays with closely spaced sensors, and thus the corresponding post-filter is suboptimal in realistic noise conditions. In this paper, a more general expression of the post-filter estimation is developed based on an assumed knowledge of the complex coherence of the noise field. This general expression can be used to construct a more appropriate post-filter in a variety of different noise fields. In experiments using real noise recordings from a computer office, the modified post-filter results in significant improvement in terms of objective speech quality measures and speech recognition performance using a diffuse noise model.","1558-2353","","10.1109/TSA.2003.818212","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1255457","","Microphone arrays;Low-frequency noise;Speech enhancement;Coherence;Sensor arrays;Transfer functions;Frequency;Genetic expression;Speech recognition;Array signal processing","microphones;acoustic transducer arrays;array signal processing;speech recognition;acoustic signal processing;spectral analysis;digital filters","microphone array;post-filter estimation;noise field coherence;noise field complex coherence;computer office noise;objective speech quality;speech recognition;diffuse noise model","","186","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous approaches have used human input or restrictions on the image sequence for the matching step. In this work we use object recognition techniques based on invariant local features to select matching images, and a probabilistic model for verification. Because of this our method is insensitive to the ordering, orientation, scale and illumination of the images. It is also insensitive to 'noise' images which are not part of the panorama at all, that is, it recognises panoramas.

Two important factors affecting the sensitivity of device electrical parameters to physical variations were quantitatively considered. The quantum effect was computed using the density gradient method and the sensitivity of threshold voltage to random dopant fluctuation was studied by Monte Carlo simulation. Our results show the 3/spl sigma/ value of V/sub T/ variation caused by discrete impurity fluctuation can be greater than 100%. Thus, engineering the work function of gate materials and maintaining a nearly intrinsic channel is more desirable. Based on a design with an intrinsic channel and ideal gate work function, we analyzed the sensitivity of device electrical parameters to several important physical fluctuations such as the variations in gate length, body thickness, and gate dielectric thickness. We found that quantum effects have great impact on the performance of devices. As a result, the device electrical behavior is sensitive to small variations of body thickness. The effect dominates over the effects produced by other physical fluctuations. To achieve a relative variation of electrical parameters comparable to present practice in industry, we face a challenge of fin width control (less than /spl sim/1 nm 3/spl sigma/ value of variation) for the 20-nm FinFET devices. The constraint of the gate length variation is about 10/spl sim/15%. We estimate a tolerance of 1/spl sim/2 /spl Aring/ 3/spl sigma/ value of oxide thickness variation and up to 30% front-back oxide thickness mismatch.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2003.818594","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1239051","","MOSFETs;Semiconductor device modeling;Monte Carlo methods;CMOS integrated circuits;Tolerance analysis;Sensitivity;Work function","MOSFET;semiconductor device models;Monte Carlo methods;CMOS integrated circuits;tolerance analysis;sensitivity analysis;doping profiles;quantum interference phenomena;work function;fluctuations","double-gate devices;FinFET devices;manufacturability;integrated circuits;process tolerances;electrical parameter sensitivity;quantum effect;density gradient method;threshold voltage sensitivity;random dopant fluctuation;Monte Carlo simulation;discrete impurity fluctuation;work function engineering;gate materials;nearly intrinsic channel;ideal gate work function;gate length variations;body thickness variations;gate dielectric thickness variations;fin width control;oxide thickness variation;front-back oxide thickness mismatch;CMOS technology;double-gate MOSFET;20 nm","","157","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To achieve good generalization, it is necessary to control the ""complexity"" of the learned function. In Bayesian approaches, this is done by adopting a prior for the parameters of the function being learned. We propose a Bayesian approach to supervised learning, which leads to sparse solutions; that is, in which irrelevant parameters are automatically set exactly to zero. Other ways to obtain sparse classifiers (such as Laplacian priors, support vector machines) involve (hyper)parameters which control the degree of sparseness of the resulting classifiers; these parameters have to be somehow adjusted/estimated from the training data. In contrast, our approach does not involve any (hyper)parameters to be adjusted or estimated. This is achieved by a hierarchical-Bayes interpretation of the Laplacian prior, which is then modified by the adoption of a Jeffreys' noninformative hyperprior. Implementation is carried out by an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Experiments with several benchmark data sets show that the proposed approach yields state-of-the-art performance. In particular, our method outperforms SVMs and performs competitively with the best alternative techniques, although it involves no tuning or adjustment of sparseness-controlling hyperparameters.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2003.1227989","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1227989","","Supervised learning;Bayesian methods;Training data;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Automatic control;Laplace equations;Kernel;Neural networks;Feedforward neural networks","learning by example;generalisation (artificial intelligence);Bayes methods;maximum likelihood estimation;inference mechanisms;statistical analysis","adaptive sparseness;supervised learning;functional mapping;training examples;generalization;Bayesian approaches;sparse solutions;hierarchical-Bayes interpretation;Laplacian prior;noninformative hyperprior;expectation-maximization algorithm;experiments;benchmark data sets;hyperparameters","","280","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The hyperspectral images were collected using a CCD camera equipped with a liquid crystal tunable filter to provide 31 bands over the near-infrared (0.7 /spl mu/m-1.0 /spl mu/m). Spectral measurements over the near-infrared allow the sensing of subsurface tissue structure which is significantly different from person to person, but relatively stable over time. The local spectral properties of human tissue are nearly invariant to face orientation and expression which allows hyperspectral discriminants to be used for recognition over a large range of poses and expressions. We describe a face recognition algorithm that exploits spectral measurements for multiple facial tissue types. We demonstrate experimentally that this algorithm can be used to recognize faces over time in the presence of changes in facial pose and expression.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2003.1251148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1251148","","Face recognition;Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Humans;Image recognition;Image databases;Charge coupled devices;Charge-coupled image sensors;Liquid crystals;Filters","face recognition;computer vision;CCD image sensors;infrared imaging;visual databases;spectral analysis","hyperspectral cameras;human face recognition;near infrared hyperspectral images;CCD camera;liquid crystal tunable filter;spectral measurements;subsurface tissue structure;human tissue;face orientation;hyperspectral discriminants;multiple facial tissue types;facial pose;facial expression;0.7 to 1.0 micron","","174","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The objectives are in conflict since the improvement of one of them leads to the deterioration of another. Instead of a unique optimal solution, it exists a set of best tradeoffs between competing objectives, the so-called Pareto-optimal solutions. A specially tailored nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) for a PMU placement problem is proposed as a methodology to find these Pareto-optimal solutions. The algorithm is combined with the graph-theoretical procedure and a simple GA to reduce the initial number of the PMU's candidate locations. The NSGA parameters are carefully set by performing a number of trial runs and evaluating the NSGA performances based on the number of distinct Pareto-optimal solutions found in the particular run and distance of the obtained Pareto front from the optimal one.

The analysis reveals strong differences in extent of usage, type of usage, and software selection based on individually significant environmental and intermediate factors. It also provides strong support for the hypotheses relating to extent of software use and level of software package used, while providing qualified support for the hypothesis relating to software use for planning only versus planning and control.

EZ-Gimpy, currently used by Yahoo, and Gimpy are CAPTCHAs based on word recognition in the presence of clutter. These CAPTCHAs provide excellent test sets since the clutter they contain is adversarial; it is designed to confuse computer programs. We have developed efficient methods based on shape context matching that can identify the word in an EZ-Gimpy image with a success rate of 92%, and the requisite 3 words in a Gimpy image 33% of the time.

Sci., Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","","2003","49","12","3235","3249","Network security is important for information protection in open, secure, or covert communications. One such requirement is to achieve high-rate communications between clients, e.g., terminals or sensors, in the network while hiding information about the transmitted symbols, signal activity, or other sensitive data from an unintended receiver, e.g., an eavesdropper. For wireless links, the single-user capacity advantages of deployment of multiple antennas at the transmitter is well known. One of the principal conclusions of this paper is that proper exploitation of space-time diversity at the transmitter can also enhance information security and information-hiding capabilities. In particular, we show that significant gains are achievable when the transmitter and the client receiver are both informed about their channel while the transmitter and eavesdropper receiver are uniformed about their channel. More generally, we compare capacity limits for both informed and uninformed transmitter and informed receiver scenarios subject to low probability of intercept (LPI) and low probability of detection (LPD) constraints. For several general cases, we can characterize the LPI- and LPD-optimal transmitted source distributions and compare them to the standard optimal source distribution satisfying a power constraint. We assume the standard quasi-static flat Rayleigh-fading channel model for the transmitter-receiver pairs. This paper is a step toward answering the fundamental question: what are the qualitative and quantitative differences between the information-carrying capabilities of open space-time channels versus secure space-time channels?","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2003.820010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1255548","","Information security;Transmitters;Wireless sensor networks;Cryptography;Data security;Communication system security;Channel capacity;Protection;Rayleigh channels;MIMO","channel coding;communication complexity;cryptography;radiocommunication;Rayleigh channels;space-time codes;telecommunication security","Chernoff exponent;covert channel;Rayleigh-fading model;information hiding;channel capacity;space-time coding;wireless eavesdropper;network security;secure communication;probability detection;probability intercept","","202","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Simultaneous measurements of drain current and surface potential indicate that large change in surface potential after stress is responsible for the reduction in drain current in these devices. Measurements of surface potential profile from the gate edge toward the drain as a function of time indicate that surface potential changes occur mostly near the gate. It is proposed that the surface potential changes are caused by electrons which tunnel from the gate under high bias stress and get trapped at the surface states near the gate. Passivation of the surface with SiN/sub x/ reduces the transient magnitudes to a large extent. This correlates with a large improvement in microwave power performance in these devices after passivation.

The advantage of the proposed method is that the iron loss resistance can be calculated directly without any measurements related to mechanical loss.

To render a full-color image, an interpolation process, commonly referred to as CFA demosaicking, is required to estimate the other two missing color values at each pixel. In this paper, we present two contributions to the CFA demosaicking: a new and improved CFA demosaicking method for producing high quality color images and new image measures for quantifying the performance of demosaicking methods. The proposed demosaicking method consists of two successive steps: an interpolation step that estimates missing color values by exploiting spatial and spectral correlations among neighboring pixels, and a post-processing step that suppresses noticeable demosaicking artifacts by adaptive median filtering. Moreover, in recognition of the limitations of current image measures, we propose two types of image measures to quantify the performance of different demosaicking methods; the first type evaluates the fidelity of demosaicked images by computing the peak signal-to-noise ratio and CIELAB /spl utri/E/sup *//sub ab/ for edge and smooth regions separately, and the second type accounts for one major demosaicking artifact-zipper effect. We gauge the proposed demosaicking method and image measures using several existing methods as benchmarks, and demonstrate their efficacy using a variety of test images.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2003.816004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1233562","","Sensor arrays;Image sensors;Pixel;Interpolation;Color;Current measurement;Digital cameras;Digital filters;Rendering (computer graphics);Adaptive filters","image colour analysis;rendering (computer graphics);interpolation;median filters;adaptive filters;edge detection;image denoising;spectral analysis;spatial filters;image sampling;parameter estimation;image segmentation;image sensors;colour graphics","color filter array demosaicking;performance measures;single-sensor digital cameras;full-color image rendering;interpolation process;CFA demosaicking;parameter estimation;sensor pixel sampling;high quality color images;missing color values;spatial correlation;spectral correlation;post-processing step;artifact suppression;adaptive median filtering;image measures;fidelity evaluation;peak signal-to-noise ratio;CIELAB /spl utri/E/sup *//sub ab/;false color;edge regions;smooth regions;artifact-zipper effect","","216","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Where the application of this technique differs in computer vision from other fields is in the variety and severity of the registration transformation between the images. In particular this transformation is generally unknown, and a significant component of solving the SR problem in computer vision is the estimation of the transformation. The transformation may have a simple parametric form, or it may be scene dependent and have to be estimated for every point. In either case the transformation is estimated directly and automatically from the images. We describe the two key components that are necessary for successful SR restoration: the accurate alignment or registration of the LR images and the formulation of an SR estimator that uses a generative image model together with a prior model of the super-resolved image itself.

"Nanorobots, NEMS, and nanoassembly","A. A. G. Requicha","Lab. for Molecular Robotics, Univ. of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA","Proceedings of the IEEE","","2003","91","11","1922","1933","Nanorobotics encompasses the design, fabrication, and programming of robots with overall dimensions below a few micrometers, and the programmable assembly of nanoscale objects. Nanorobots are quintessential nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) and raise all the important issues that must be addressed in NEMS design: sensing, actuation, control, communications, power, and interfacing across spatial scales and between the organic/inorganic and biotic/abiotic realms. Nanorobots are expected to have revolutionary applications in such areas as environmental monitoring and health care. This paper begins by discussing nanorobot construction, which is still at an embryonic stage. The emphasis is on nanomachines, an area which has seen a spate of rapid progress over the last few years. Nanoactuators will be essential components of future NEMS. The paper's focus then changes to nanoassembly by manipulation with scanning probe microscopes (SPMs), which is a relatively well established process for prototyping nanosystems. Prototyping of nanodevices and systems is important for design validation, parameter optimization and sensitivity studies. Nanomanipulation also has applications in repair and modification of nanostructures built by other means. High-throughput SPM manipulation may be achieved by using multitip arrays.

As the number of this type of plants increases, the gas and electricity systems are linked together. Therefore, power system reliability studies should consider the gas supply reliability. As a consequence, the new generation of reliability models should take into account the joint operation of electrical and gas systems. This paper presents a model to compute the maximum amount of power that can be supplied by the combined-cycle power plants in a system. The gas network is modeled. The effect of compressors to enlarge the transmission capacity of the network is included. The developed model will be integrated into a higher level model that analyzes the joint reliability of the electrical and gas systems. A case study based on the Belgian high-calorific gas network is analyzed.","","0-7803-7967-5","10.1109/PTC.2003.1304696","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1304696","","Power system reliability;Power system modeling;Natural gas;Power generation;Power generation economics;Electricity supply industry;Power industry;Fuels;Power system analysis computing;Compressors","power transmission reliability;combined cycle power stations;natural gas technology;optimisation","natural gas network;power systems reliability;power generation;Spain;combined-cycle power plants;electricity systems;gas supply reliability;compressors;network transmission capacity;Belgian high-calorific gas network;optimisation method","","58","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The broad-band spatial power-combining technique addresses all these issues by combining the output power of a large quantity of microwave monolithic integrated circuit (MMIC) amplifiers in a broad-band coaxial waveguide environment, while maintaining good linearity and improving phase noise of the MMIC amplifiers. A coaxial waveguide was used as the host of the combining circuits for broader bandwidth and better uniformity by equally distributing the input power to each element. A new compact coaxial combiner with much smaller size is investigated. Broad-band slotline to microstrip-line transition is integrated for better compatibility with commercial MMIC amplifiers. Thermal simulations are performed and an improved thermal management scheme over previous designs is employed to improve the heat sinking in high-power application. A high-power amplifier using the compact combiner design is built and demonstrated to have a bandwidth from 6 to 17 GHz with 44-W maximum output power. Linearity measurement has shown a high third-order intercept point of 52 dBm. Analysis shows the amplifier has the ability to extend spurious-free dynamic range by N/sup 2/3/ times. The amplifier also has shown a residual phase floor close to -140 dBc at 10-kHz offset from the carrier with 5-6-dB reductions compared to a single MMIC amplifier it integrates.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2003.819766","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1256779","","High power amplifiers;Power amplifiers;MMICs;Bandwidth;Linearity;Coaxial components;Thermal management;Power generation;Microwave amplifiers;Integrated circuit noise","MMIC power amplifiers;coaxial waveguides;microstrip lines;wideband amplifiers","broad-band high-power amplifier;spatial power-combining;microwave monolithic integrated circuit amplifiers;broad-band coaxial waveguide;phase noise;MMIC amplifiers;coaxial waveguide;broadband slotline-microstrip line transition;thermal simulations;heat sinking;residual phase floor;high-power application;third-order intercept point;spurious-free dynamic range;44 W;5 to 6 dB;6 to 17 GHz","","47","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this approach, the filter corresponding to the first integrator is a lowpass filter which smoothes out the feedback waveform by attenuating the high-frequency quantization noise. This lowpass filtering decreases the power consumption of a switched-capacitor implementation and alternatively reduces the sensitivity to clock jitter in a continuous-time structure. A design methodology ensuring the stability of the system is presented.

Frequently, the DTC technique controls the speed of the motor by controlling stator flux with the aim of obtaining an optimal torque. A varying flux, proportional to the torque, may be used instead of a fixed flux, resulting in a maximum torque per ampere or maximum torque per flux (MTPF). In this paper, a reference-flux-generating method is followed to achieve the MTPF. An approximate equation is then derived using numerical techniques in order to obtain the reference flux from the torque. This equation is then applied to the DTC control system in order to obtain the reference flux.

We present a new class of geometric deformable models designed using a novel topology-preserving level set method, which achieves topology preservation by applying the simple point concept from digital topology. These new models maintain the other advantages of standard geometric deformable models including subpixel accuracy and production of nonintersecting curves or surfaces. Moreover, since the topology-preserving constraint is enforced efficiently through local computations, the resulting algorithm incurs only nominal computational overhead over standard geometric deformable models.

In this paper, we present a novel link adaptation algorithm, which aims to improve the system throughput by adapting the transmission rate to the current link condition. Our algorithm is simply based on the received signal strength measured from the received frames, and hence it does not require any changes in the current IEEE 802.11 WLAN medium access control (MAC) protocol.

It reflects the need to look at large wind farms as power plants, as a result of the increased penetration of wind energy in the power systems many places in the world. To obtain an optimal integration of high penetration of wind energy in the system, the wind farms must be able to replace other power plants, i.e. be able to participate in the control and stabilization of the power system. If e.g. a large wind farm trips due to a grid fault, the power system will suffer from a severe loss of supply. The main result of the project is a verified model of a wind farm, which can be used to study and improve the power plant characteristics of the wind farm, and a tentative assessment of the power quality of the wind farm, based on simulations with the developed model and verified by measurements. This research provided a different approach to wind turbine modeling and control design methodology. All the results were in close agreement with results from other studies. The main strategy of the controller was to regulate the rotor angular speed and the power demand to match the required profiles. A simple wind turbine model was linearized about an operating point and it was used to systematically perform trade-off studies between minimization parameters. The robust nature of the PID controller was illustrated and optimal operating conditions were determined. Continued research illustrates that the optimum wind turbine has not yet been build and most of the remaining work lies in how the wind turbine is controlled. Additional design and control strategy improvements can be expected as experience is gained with wind turbine operations.","0094-2898","0-7803-7697-8","10.1109/SSST.2003.1194540","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1194540","","Wind turbines;Wind farms;Power system modeling;Power system dynamics;Power generation;Wind energy;Optimal control;Power system faults;Distributed control;Electrical equipment industry","wind turbines;wind power plants;power system stability;power system control;power system faults;power supply quality;rotors;angular velocity control;machine control;three-term control","wind turbine;distributed resource;deregulated electric power industry;large wind farms;power plants;power system stabilization;power system control;grid fault;rotor angular speed regulation;minimization parameters;PID controller;optimal operating conditions","","17","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents results including a comparison with state-of-the-art silicon diodes. Switching losses for two silicon diodes (a fast diode, 600 V, 50 A, 60 ns Trr), an ultrafast silicon diode (600 V, 50 A, 23 ns Trr), and a 4H-SiC diode (600 V, 50 A) are compared. The effect of diode reverse recovery on the turn-on losses of a fast insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) are studied both at room temperature and at 150 /spl deg/C. At room temperature, SiC diodes allow a reduction of IGBT turn-on losses by 25% compared to ultrafast silicon diodes and by 70% compared to fast silicon diodes. At 150 /spl deg/C junction temperature, SiC diodes allow turn-on loss reductions of 35% and 85% compared to ultrafast and fast silicon diodes, respectively. The silicon and SiC diodes are used in a boost converter with the IGBT to assess the overall effect of SiC diodes on the converter characteristics. Efficiency measurements at light load (100 W) and full load (500 W) are reported. Although SiC diodes exhibit very low switching losses, their high conduction losses due to the high forward drop dominate the overall losses, hence reducing the overall efficiency. Since this is an ongoing development, it is expected that future prototypes will have improved forward characteristics.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2003.813730","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1215418","","Diodes;Silicon carbide;Insulated gate bipolar transistors;Power electronics;Switching loss;Temperature;Forward contracts;Industry Applications Society;Lakes;Electromagnetic interference","silicon compounds;power semiconductor diodes;DC-DC power convertors;losses;switching;current density;insulated gate bipolar transistors;semiconductor materials","silicon carbide diodes;state-of-the-art silicon diodes;power electronic applications;current density;switching losses;ultrafast silicon diode;4H-SiC diode;diode reverse recovery;turn-on losses;fast insulated gate bipolar transistor;IGBT;turn-on loss reductions;boost converter;high conduction losses;high forward drop;overall efficiency;600 V;50 A;60 ns;23 ns;150 degC;100 W;500 W;SiC","","89","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This way, subpicoampere currents are characterized without driving them off chip and requiring expensive instrumentation with complicated low leakage setups. A special current mirror is also introduced for reliably replicating such low currents. As an example, a simple log-domain first-order low-pass filter is implemented that uses a 100-fF capacitor and a 3.5-fA bias current to achieve a cutoff frequency of 0.5 Hz.

As a result, the utilization efficiency of photovoltaic (PV)-module can be increased. In addition, as it doesn't use a digital signal processor (DSP), this MPPT method has the merits of both a cost efficiency and a simple control circuit design.

The idea is to deal with issues connected with lack of memory by allowing a selection pressure that is high enough to offset the disruptive effect of uniform crossover. The pe-cGA finds a near optimal solution (i.e., a winner) that is maintained as long as other solutions generated from probability vectors are no better.

However, the introduction of video and imaging sensors has posed additional challenges. Transmission of video and imaging data requires both energy and QoS aware routing in order to ensure efficient usage of the sensors and effective access to the gathered measurements. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware QoS routing protocol, which can also run efficiently with best-effort traffic. The protocol finds a least-cost, delay-constrained path for real-time data in terms of link cost that captures nodes' energy reserve, transmission energy, error rate and other communication parameters. Moreover, throughput for non-real-time data is maximized by adjusting the service rate for both real-time and non-realtime data at sensor nodes.

Methods and circuits are proposed to achieve fixed switching frequency operation. The control loop adjusts delay of the controller and thus controls the output frequency. This is done by using a phase-frequency detector (PFD) to lock the frequency of switching signal with the input clock. The delay value is determined automatically according to operating conditions. Simulation results showed fast load and line transient responses and fixed frequency operations in steady states. In addition, stability of the regulator is shown under a very low output-to-input voltage ratio condition that is difficult for conventional PWM controllers.","1558-3767","","10.1109/LPEL.2003.819643","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1257346","","Regulators;Phase frequency detector;Delay;Pulse width modulation;Batteries;Central Processing Unit;Circuits;Switching frequency;Phase detection;Clocks","notebook computers;computer power supplies;switching convertors;delays;frequency control;transient response","ripple control buck regulator;fixed output frequency;high-voltage adaptor;battery supplies;low-voltage CPU core supply;notebook computers;fixed switching frequency operation;control loop;phase-frequency detector;input clock;delay value;fast load;line transient responses;regulator stability;very low output-to-input voltage ratio condition;DC-DC converter;hysteretic comparator","","53","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nevertheless, a direct application of the Leeson model without care can lead to erroneous results because the formula contains hidden parameters that are generally unwittingly ill evaluated or neglected. Thus, a brute-force calculation of phase noise with the Leeson formula can lead to errors of several orders of magnitude (i.e., several tens of decibels). A detailed analysis enables us to enlighten the hidden parameters leading to a modified Leeson formula that is valid for all oscillator circuits. It explicitly takes into account all the parameters needed for phase-noise calculation. In order to demonstrate the ease of use and accuracy of the new formula, we apply it to several oscillator circuits with lumped elements, transmission lines, and high-Q resonators. Finally the analytical results are confirmed by numerical simulations with a nonlinear transistor model.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2003.809187","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1193156","","Phase noise;Oscillators;Semiconductor device noise;Circuit noise;Frequency domain analysis;Feedback circuits;Passive circuits;Output feedback;Distributed parameter circuits;Numerical simulation","phase noise;feedback oscillators;microwave oscillators;microwave circuits;circuit simulation;Q-factor","phase noise;Leeson formula;linear feedback-systems formalism;errors;oscillator circuits;lumped elements;transmission lines;high-Q resonators;microwave oscillator design;numerical simulations;nonlinear transistor model","","38","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A number of new and potentially concepts and products based on the concept of security network intelligence have been introduced, including smart flows, intelligent routing, and intelligent Web switching. Many intelligent systems focus on a specific security service, function, or device, and do not provide true end-to-end service network intelligence. True security network intelligence requires more than a set of disconnected elements, it requires an interconnecting and functionally coupled architecture that enables the various functional levels to interact and communicate with each other. We propose a uniform work for understanding end-to-end communication security network intelligence (CSNI), which is defined as the ability of a network to act appropriately in a changing environment. We consider an appropriate action to be one that increases the optimal and efficient use of network resources in delivering services, and we define success as the achievement of behaviour sub-goals that support the service provider's ultimate goals, which are defined external to the network system. The work presented incorporates the functional elements of intelligence into computational modules and interconnects the modules into networks and hierarchies that have spatial, logical, and temporal properties. Based on the work proposed, we describe an end-to-end multiservice network application spanning the network security management layer, optical layer, switching/routing layer, security services layer, and other layers.","","0-7803-7882-2","10.1109/CCST.2003.1297531","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1297531","","Intelligent networks;Home automation;Communication system security;Routing;Communication switching;Intelligent systems;Computational intelligence;Computer networks;Computer network management;Optical interconnections","intelligent networks;telecommunication security;telecommunication network routing;data communication;computer networks;safety systems","smart flow;intelligent routing;intelligent Web switching;functionally coupled architecture;end-to-end communication security network intelligence;multiservice network application;network security management layer;optical layer;switching layer;routing layer;security service layer","","5","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One limitation of the NavBelt is that it is exceedingly difficult for the user to comprehend the guidance signals in time to allow fast walking. A newer device, called GuideCane, effectively overcomes this problem. The GuideCane uses the same mobile robotics technology as the NavBelt but is a wheeled device pushed ahead of the user via an attached cane. When the GuideCane detects an obstacle, it steers around it. The user immediately feels this steering action and can follow the GuideCane's new path easily without any conscious effort.

In order to segment such regions properly, the concept of the ""texture gradient"" is introduced. Texture information and its gradient are extracted using a novel nondecimated form of a complex wavelet transform. A novel marker location algorithm is subsequently used to locate significant homogeneous textured or non textured regions.

The primary winding of the first transformer for axial displacement has 31 double disk coils (1.3 MVA, 10 kV) and the secondary winding is a four layer winding. The second transformer for the study of radial deformation has 30 double disk coils (1.2 MVA, 10 kV) as primary winding and a one layer winding as secondary winding.

A feature of skeletal matching is the ability to perform part-matching, and its inherent intuitiveness, which helps in defining the search and in visualizing the results.

Recently, high-performance BLDC motor drives are widely used for variable speed drive systems of the industrial applications. In case of the control of robot arms and tracking applications with lower stiffness, we cannot design the speed controller gain to be very large from the viewpoint of the system stability. Thus, the feedforward compensator with disturbance torque observer was proposed. This method can improve the servo stiffness without increasing the speed controller gain. The enhanced speed control performance can be achieved and the speed response against the disturbance torque can be improved for high-performance BLDC motor drive systems in which the bandwidth of the speed controller cannot be made large enough. The load disturbance is compensated by detected load torque through the observer. The compensation current is made through q-axis current. The d-q transform of phase currents were possible by the Fourier series summation method. Consequently, the speed control for high-performance BLDC motor drives become improved.

The challenging task is to make virtual objects blend harmoniously into the real scene and appear as if they are like real. Apart from constructing detailed geometric 3D model representation and obtaining accurate surface properties for virtual objects, adopting real scene lighting information to render virtual objects is another important factor to achieve photorealistic rendering. Such a factor not only improves visual complexity of virtual objects, but also determines the consistency of illumination between the virtual objects and the surrounding real objects in the scene. Conventional rendering techniques such as ray tracing, and radiosity require intensive computation and data preparation to solve the lighting transport equation. Hence, they are less practical for rendering virtual objects in augmented reality, which demands a real-time performance. This work explores an image-based and hardware-based approach to improve photorealism for rendering synthetic objects in augmented reality. It uses a recent technique of image-based lighting, environment illumination maps, and a simple yet practical multi-pass rendering framework for augmented reality.","","0-7695-2006-5","10.1109/ISMAR.2003.1240704","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1240704","","Augmented reality;Lighting;Rendering (computer graphics);Layout;Application software;Cinematography;Visualization;Biomedical imaging;Solid modeling;Ray tracing","augmented reality;rendering (computer graphics);lighting;computer displays;ray tracing;realistic images","photorealistic rendering;augmented reality;3D computer-generated images;real-scene images;entertainment;cinematography;design visualization;medical trainings;virtual objects;image construction;geometric 3D model;image representation;surface properties;lighting information;visual complexity;ray tracing;radiosity;intensive computation;data preparation;lighting transport equation;real-time performance;image-based approach;hardware-based approach;photorealism;synthetic objects;image-based lighting;environment illumination maps;multipass rendering","","42","","44","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The thermal model used, which takes into account the thermoregulatory system of the human body, has been validated through a comparison with experimental data. The results show that the peak specific absorption rate (SAR) as averaged over 10 g has about a 25-fold increase in the trunk and a 50-fold increase in the limbs with respect to the whole body averaged SAR (SAR/sub WB/). The peak SAR as averaged over 1 g, instead, has a 30- to 60-fold increase in the trunk, and up to 135-fold increase in the ankles, with respect to SAR/sub WB/. With reference to temperature increases, at the body resonance frequency of 40 MHz, for the ICNIRP incident power density maximum permissible value, a temperature increase of about 0.7/spl deg/C is obtained in the ankles muscle.

Inspired by complex, functional, self-assembled structures and systems found in Nature we suggest that self-assembly can be employed as an effective tool for nanofabrication. We define a self-assembling system as one in which the elements of the system interact in pre-defined ways to spontaneously generate a higher order structure. Self-assembly is a parallel fabrication process that, at the molecular level, can generate three-dimensional structures with sub-nanometer precision. Guiding the process of self-assembly by external forces and geometrical constraints can reconfigure a system dynamically on demand. We survey some of the recent applications of self-assembly for nanofabrication of electronic and photonic devices.

Moreover, it has high power density with high proportion of torque to inertia in spite of small size drive. However, at high-speed operation, torque and speed response characteristic is deteriorated by the motor inductance components in stator windings. It is difficult that the BLDC motor is used to the industrial application requiring a wide range of operating speeds. Phase advance angle control method of different methods used to improve torque and speed response is used widely at high-speed operation. However, conventional phase advance angle control method was considered about forward motoring mode. Therefore, position information error of rotor that reverse motoring mode has phase lag angle of double comparing with forward motoring mode is occurred. Consequently, torque performance is destroyed significantly. In this paper, a control method using adjustment of the phase advance angle is proposed. This proposed method improves the torque and speed response characteristic by minimizing delay of current at high-speed operation. Simulated results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method through comparison with the conventional control method.","","0-7803-7768-0","10.1109/APEC.2003.1179229","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1179229","","Current control;Brushless DC motors;Torque;DC motors;Brushless motors;Voltage;Acoustic noise;Induction motors;Inductance;Stator windings","brushless DC motors;electric current control;machine control;torque;stators;PWM invertors;dynamic response","current control method;torque improvement;high-speed BLDC motor;brushless DC motor;low acoustic noise;fast dynamic response;high power density;speed response;torque response;inductance components;stator windings;phase advance angle control method;position information error;reverse motoring mode;phase lag angle;torque performance;PWM inverter","","15","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The number of complex multiplier is minimized via a bit-inverse and bit-reverse data scheduling scheme.

Beamforming is a low complexity technique that increases the receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), however, it requires channel knowledge. Since in practice channel knowledge at the transmitter is difficult to realize, we propose a technique where the receiver designs the beamforming vector and sends it to the transmitter by transmitting a label in a finite set, or codebook, of beamforming vectors. A codebook design method for quantized versions of maximum ratio transmission, equal gain transmission, and generalized selection diversity with maximum ratio combining at the receiver is presented. The codebook design criterion exploits the quantization problem's relationship with Grassmannian line packing. Systems using the beamforming codebooks are shown to have a diversity order of the product of the number of transmit and the number of receive antennas.

A recently proposed approach that appears promising in overcoming this drawback of traditional algorithms, is a state-space approach using particle filtering. In this paper we formulate a general framework for tracking an acoustic source using particle filters. We discuss four specific algorithms that fit within this framework, and demonstrate their performance using both simulated reverberant data and data recorded in a moderately reverberant office room (with a measured reverberation time of 0.39 s).

IBR techniques can be classified into three categories according to how much geometric information is used: rendering without geometry, rendering with implicit geometry (i.e., correspondence), and rendering with explicit geometry (either with approximate or accurate geometry). We discuss the characteristics of these categories and their representative techniques. IBR techniques demonstrate a surprising diverse range in their extent of use of images and geometry in representing 3-D scenes. We explore the issues in trading off the use of images and geometry by revisiting plenoptic-sampling analysis and the notions of view dependency and geometric proxies.

The VCO incorporates the ring oscillator configuration with active inductor loads, generating four half-quadrature clocks. The VCO control line comprises both a programmable 6-bit digital coarse control and a folded differential fine control through a charge-pump and a low pass filter. Duty-cycle correction of clock signals is obtained by exploiting a high common-mode rejection ratio differential amplifier at the ring oscillator output. A 1/8-rate linear phase detector accomplishes the phase error detection with no systematic phase offset and inherently performs the 1:4 demultiplexing.

"Interacting with computers by voice: automatic speech recognition and synthesis","D. O'Shaughnessy","INRS-Telecommun., Montreal, Que., Canada","Proceedings of the IEEE","","2003","91","9","1272","1305","This paper examines how people communicate with computers using speech. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) transforms speech into text, while automatic speech synthesis [or text-to-speech (TTS)] performs the reverse task. ASR has been largely developed based on speech coding theory, while simulating certain spectral analyses performed by the ear. Typically, a Fourier transform is employed, but following the auditory Bark scale and simplifying the spectral representation with a decorrelation into cepstral coefficients. Current ASR provides good accuracy and performance on limited practical tasks, but exploits only the most rudimentary knowledge about human production and perception phenomena. The popular mathematical model called the hidden Markov model (HMM) is examined; first-order HMMs are efficient but ignore long-range correlations in actual speech. Common language models use a time window of three successive words in their syntactic-semantic analysis. Speech synthesis is the automatic generation of a speech waveform, typically from an input text. As with ASR, TTS starts from a database of information previously established by analysis of much training data, both speech and text. Previously analyzed speech is stored in small units in the database, for concatenation in the proper sequence at runtime. TTS systems first perform text processing, including ""letter-to-sound"" conversion, to generate the phonetic transcription. Intonation must be properly specified to approximate the naturalness of human speech. Modern synthesizers using large databases of stored spectral patterns or waveforms output highly intelligible synthetic speech, but naturalness remains to be improved.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2003.817117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1230211","","Automatic speech recognition;Speech synthesis;Hidden Markov models;Speech analysis;Databases;Humans;Speech coding;Computational modeling;Analytical models;Spectral analysis","speech recognition;speech synthesis;hidden Markov models;speech coding;Fourier transforms","automatic speech recognition;automatic speech synthesis;text-to-speech synthesis;speech coding theory;spectral analyses;Fourier transform;hidden Markov model","","47","","292","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The impedance matching of the TSA input impedance (obtained by the transmission matrix properties) to the generator impedance is achieved by minimizing an error criterion constructed as the magnitude squared of the difference between the generator and input impedances over the desired bandwidth. The attenuation constant of the stepline is computed by the broadside radiation of TSA (which is an endfire antenna) and the longitudinal power flow. The spectral domain immitance approach is used to compute the broadside radiation, by first determining the electric field components in the slot by the Galerkin's method and then obtaining the equivalent magnetic surface current densities. The power flow in the endfire direction of TSA may be computed by the Poynting's vector in the substrate. The attenuation constant is calculated for various values of slot width.

The resistor in the proposed V-I converter is further replaced by a switched capacitor resistor. Due to less variation in the capacitor value across PVT's and high accuracy in integrated voltage reference, the output reference current remains fairly constant.

A phased addition algorithm is developed that allows an omni-directional, B-scan image of the surrounding plate to be synthesized from any geometry of array. Numerically simulated data from a single reflector is used to test the performance of the algorithm. The results from an array containing a fully populated circular area of elements (Type I array) are found to be good, but those from an array containing a single ring of elements (Type II array) contain many large side-lobes. An enhancement to the basic phased addition algorithm is presented that uses deconvolution to suppress these side-lobes. The deconvolution algorithm enables a Type II array to equal the performance of a Type I array of the same overall diameter. The effect of diameter on angular resolution is investigated.

Chin Yi Inst. of Technol., Taichung, Taiwan","IEEE Transactions on Reliability","","2003","52","3","373","383","Preventive maintenance (PM) is an effective approach for reliability enhancement. Time-based and condition-based maintenance are two major approaches for PM. In contrast, condition-based maintenance can be a better and more cost-effective type of maintenance than time-based maintenance. However, irrespective of the approach adopted for PM, whether a failure can be detected early or even predicted is the key point. This paper presents a failure prediction method for PM by state estimation using the Kalman filter. To improve preventive maintenance, this study uses a hybrid Petri-net modeling method coupled with fault-tree analysis and Kalman filtering to perform failure prediction and processing. A Petri net arrangement, viz, early failure detection and isolation arrangement (EFDIA), is used; it facilitates alarm, early failure detection, fault isolation, event count, system-state description, and automatic shutdown or regulation. These functions are very useful for health-monitoring and preventive-maintenance of a system. This study implements EFDIA to an application-specific integrated circuit on a Xilinx Demonstration Board. A condition-monitoring system of a thermal power plant is used as an example to demonstrate the proposed scheme. Linking the Kalman filter to the EFDIA Petri net, a condition-based failure prediction and processing scheme has been completed for preventive maintenance. This paper presents a failure prediction and processing scheme for PM via the thermal power-plant example, by using a hybrid Petri net modeling method endowed with fault-tree analysis and Kalman filtering. The FPN (Petri net dealing with system failure) has to be constructed beforehand. The next step is to obtain control charts for all fault places in the FPN in order to prescribe thresholds and increment times for every step in Kalman prediction. Afterwards, the system model of each place in the FPN must be derived to perform Kalman filtering. With these prerequisites, this method can be applied to any system. The proposed Petri net approach not only can achieve early failure detection and isolation for fault diagnosis but also facilitates event count, system state description, and automatic shutdown or regulation. These capabilities are very useful for health monitoring and PM of a system. Since the triggering signal of S/sub i/ place of the EFDIA in Section IV (S/sub i/ is a place for the Kalman-predicted indicator value of the sensing signal for the Petri net dealing with system failure) indicates that subsystem #i performance is going to reach the prescribed failure threshold, the signal can be provided via the Kalman filtering method in Section III. Linking the Kalman filter to the EFDIA Petri net, a condition-based failure prediction and processing scheme has been completed for preventive maintenance.","1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2003.816402","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1248655","","Preventive maintenance;Kalman filters;Circuit faults;Filtering;Event detection;Fault detection;Predictive models;Failure analysis;Electrical fault detection;Joining processes","maintenance engineering;thermal power stations;fault location;Kalman filters;Petri nets;state estimation;fault trees","condition-based failure-prediction;preventive maintenance;reliability enhancement;condition-based maintenance;state estimation;Kalman filter;hybrid Petri-net modeling method;fault-tree analysis;early failure detection;isolation arrangement;alarm;fault isolation;event count;system-state description;automatic shutdown;automatic regulation;health-monitoring;application-specific integrated circuit;Xilinx Demonstration Board;thermal power plant;control charts;triggering signal","","75","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We take advantage of the properties of modulation and demodulation to separate the signal from the DC offset and use nonlinear multiplicative feedback to cancel the offset. The feedback also attenuates out-of-band noise and further enhances the power of a lock-in technique. Experimentally, in a 1.5-μm BiCMOS chip, a fabrication DC offset of 2 mV and an intentional offset of 100 mV were attenuated to 9 μV. Our offset-canceling technique could also be useful for practical multipliers that need tolerance to fabrication errors. We present a detailed theoretical noise analysis of our architecture that is confirmed by experiment. As an example application, we demonstrate the use of our architecture in a simple capacitive surface-microelectromechanical-system vibration sensor where the performance is limited by mechanical Brownian noise. However, we show that our electronics limits us to 30 μg//spl radic/Hz, which is at least six times lower than the noise floor of commercial state-of-the-art surface-micromachined inertial sensors. Our architecture could, thus, be useful in high-performance inertial sensors with low mechanical noise. In a 1-100-Hz bandwidth, our electronic detection threshold corresponds to a one-part-per-eight-million change in capacitance.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2002.807173","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1175505","","Mechanical sensors;Feedback;Fabrication;Demodulation;Noise cancellation;BiCMOS integrated circuits;Vibrations;Capacitive sensors;Bandwidth;Capacitance","capacitive sensors;microsensors;analogue processing circuits;compensation;integrated circuit noise;BiCMOS analogue integrated circuits;circuit feedback;analogue multipliers;random noise;accelerometers;vibration measurement","capacitive sensing;offset-canceling lock-in architecture;low-noise lock-in architecture;modulation;demodulation;DC offset;offset compensation;nonlinear multiplicative feedback;out-of-band noise attenuation;BiCMOS chip;noise analysis;capacitive vibration sensor;capacitive MEMS sensor;mechanical Brownian noise;surface-micromachined sensors;inertial sensors;electronic detection threshold;accelerometer;analog multiplier;1.5 micron;1 to 100 Hz;100 Hz","","59","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we evaluate the contention-based channel access mechanism, called enhanced distributed coordination function (EDCF), in comparison with the 802.11 legacy MAC. The ECDF provides differentiated channel access to frames with different priorities. We also consider an optional feature of the EDCF, called contention-free burst (CFB), which allows multiple MAC frame transmissions during a single transmission opportunity (TXOP). Through our simulation study, we conclude that the EDCF can provide differentiated channel access for different traffic types. Furthermore, the CFB is found to enhance the EDCF performance by increasing the overall system throughput and achieving more acceptable streaming quality in terms of frame losses and delays.","","0-7803-7802-4","10.1109/ICC.2003.1204546","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1204546","","Multiaccess communication;Quality of service;Wireless LAN;USA Councils;Media Access Protocol;Laboratories;Wireless communication;Communication standards;Traffic control;Performance loss","IEEE standards;wireless LAN;telecommunication standards;quality of service","IEEE 802.11e standard;contention-based channel access;performance evaluation;medium access control;MAC;wireless local area network;WLAN;enhanced distributed coordination function;contention-free burst;single transmission opportunity;multiple MAC frame transmission","","146","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The need for such transport models arose because the traditionally used drift-diffusion model cannot capture nonlocal effects which gained increasing importance in modern miniaturized semiconductor devices. In the derivation of these models from Boltzmann's transport equation, several assumptions have to be made in order to obtain a tractable equation set. Although these assumptions may differ significantly, the resulting final models show various similarities, which has frequently led to confusion. We give a detailed review on this subject, highlighting the differences and similarities between the models, and we shed some light on the critical issues associated with higher order transport models.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2002.808150","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1182061","","Hydrodynamics;Semiconductor devices;Equations;Temperature;Analytical models;Semiconductor device modeling;Closed-form solution;Semiconductor process modeling;Doping profiles;Geometry","semiconductor device models;Boltzmann equation","hydrodynamic model;energy transport model;semiconductor device simulation;nonlocal effects;Boltzmann transport equation;drift-diffusion model","","154","","133","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, as latencies increase, the size of the instruction window must increase even faster if we are to continue to tolerate these latencies. We have already reached the point where the size of an instruction window that can handle these latencies is prohibitively large in terms of both design complexity and power consumption. And, the problem is getting worse. This paper proposes runahead execution as an effective way to increase memory latency tolerance in an out-of-order processor without requiring an unreasonably large instruction window. Runahead execution unblocks the instruction window blocked by long latency operations allowing the processor to execute far ahead in the program path. This results in data being prefetched into caches long before it is needed. On a machine model based on the Intel/spl reg/ Pentium/spl reg/ processor, having a 128-entry instruction window, adding runahead execution improves the IPC (instructions per cycle) by 22% across a wide range of memory intensive applications. Also, for the same machine model, runahead execution combined with a 128-entry window performs within 1% of a machine with no runahead execution and a 384-entry instruction window.","1530-0897","0-7695-1871-0","10.1109/HPCA.2003.1183532","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1183532","","Out of order;Delay;Windows;Prefetching;Energy consumption;Engines;Trademarks;Hardware;Microprocessors;Software","performance evaluation;parallel architectures;cache storage;delays","runahead execution;out-of-order processors;high performance processors;memory latency tolerance;caches;instructions per cycle","","160","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The TS fuzzy representation of a nonlinear system subject to actuator saturation is presented. In our TS fuzzy representation, the modeling error is also captured by norm-bounded uncertainties. A set invariance condition for the system in the TS fuzzy representation is first established. Based on this set invariance condition, the problem of estimating the domain of attraction of a TS fuzzy system under a constant state feedback law is formulated and solved as a linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization problem. By viewing the state feedback gain as an extra free parameter in the LMI optimization problem, we arrive at a method for designing state feedback gain that maximizes the domain of attraction. A fuzzy scheduling control design method is also introduced to further enlarge the domain of attraction. An inverted pendulum is used to show the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy controller.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2002.806317","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1178066","","Robust stability;Control system analysis;Nonlinear control systems;Control systems;Nonlinear systems;Actuators;Fuzzy systems;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy control;State feedback","state feedback;nonlinear control systems;fuzzy control;linear matrix inequalities;robust control;stability","robust stability analysis;fuzzy-scheduling control;nonlinear systems;actuator saturation;Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models;complex nonlinear systems;fuzzy sets;fuzzy reasoning;linear input output submodels;stability analysis;modeling error;norm-bounded uncertainties;linear matrix inequality;state feedback gain;fuzzy scheduling control design;inverted pendulum;fuzzy controller","","248","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Scaling causes subthreshold leakage currents to become a large component of total power dissipation. Multithreshold technology has emerged as a promising technique to reduce leakage power. This paper presents several heuristic techniques for efficient gate clustering in multithreshold CMOS circuits by modeling the problem via bin-packing (BP) and set-partitioning (SP) techniques. The SP technique takes the circuit's routing complexity into consideration which is critical for deep submicron (DSM) implementations. By applying the techniques to six benchmarks to verify functionality, results obtained indicate that our proposed techniques can achieve on average 84% savings for leakage power and 12% savings for dynamic power. Furthermore, four hybrid clustering techniques that combine the BP and SP techniques to produce a more efficient solution are also devised. Ground bounce was also taken as a design parameter in the optimization problem. While accounting for noise, the proposed hybrid solution achieves on average 9% savings for dynamic power and 72% savings for leakage power dissipation at sufficient speeds and adequate noise margins.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2003.818127","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1233819","","Design optimization;Circuits;Threshold voltage;Power dissipation;Subthreshold current;Leakage current;Dynamic voltage scaling;Capacitance;MOS devices;Charge pumps","CMOS digital integrated circuits;VLSI;leakage currents;integrated circuit noise;circuit optimisation;circuit layout CAD;logic partitioning","multithreshold CMOS;very large scale integration design;subthreshold leakage currents;total power dissipation;heuristic techniques;gate clustering;bin-packing;set-partitioning;routing complexity;benchmarks;leakage power;dynamic power;hybrid clustering techniques;design parameter;optimization problem;leakage power dissipation;noise margins","","113","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our approach exploits the presence of mobile entities (called MULEs) present in the environment. MULEs pick up data from the sensors when in close range, buffer it, and drop off the data to wired access points. This can lead to substantial power savings at the sensors as they only have to transmit over a short range. This paper focuses on a simple analytical model for understanding performance as system parameters are scaled. Our model assumes two-dimensional random walk for mobility and incorporates key system variables such as number of MULEs, sensors and access points. The performance metrics observed are the data success rate (the fraction of generated data that reaches the access points) and the required buffer capacities on the sensors and the MULEs. The modeling along with simulation results can be used for further analysis and provide certain guidelines for deployment of such systems.","","0-7803-7879-2","10.1109/SNPA.2003.1203354","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1203354","","Monitoring;Delay;Analytical models;Power system modeling;Capacitive sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Data analysis;Telecommunication traffic;Costs;Base stations","sensor fusion;transceivers;mobile computing;wireless LAN","data MULEs;three-tier architecture;sparse sensor networks;mobile entities;two-dimensional random walk;system variables;performance metrics;data success rate;access points;buffer capacities","","592","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Test-driven development has recently re-emerged as a critical enabling practice of the extreme programming software development methodology. We ran a case study of this practice at IBM. In the process, a thorough suite of automated test cases was produced after UML design. In this case study, we found that the code developed using a test-driven development practice showed, during functional verification and regression tests, approximately 40% fewer defects than a baseline prior product developed in a more traditional fashion. The productivity of the team was not impacted by the additional focus on producing automated test cases. This test suite aids in future enhancements and maintenance of this code.

In applications such as blood flow estimation, elastography, phase aberration correction, and many more, the quality of final results is heavily dependent upon the performance of the time-delay estimator implemented. In the past years, several algorithms have been developed and applied in medical ultrasound, sonar, radar, and other fields. In this paper we analyze the performances of the widely used normalized and non-normalized correlations, along with normalized covariance, sum absolute differences (SAD), sum squared differences (SSD), hybrid-sign correlation, polarity-coincidence correlation, and the Meyr-Spies method. These techniques have been applied to simulated ultrasound radio frequency (RF) data under a variety of conditions. We show how parameters, which include center frequency, fractional bandwidth, kernel window size, signal decorrelation, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) affect the quality of the delay estimate. Simulation results also are compared with a theoretical performance limit set by the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Results show that, for high SNR, high signal correlation, and large kernel size, all of the algorithms closely match the theoretical bound, with relative performances that vary by as much as 20%. As conditions degrade, the performances of various algorithms differ more significantly. For signals with a correlation level of 0.98, SNR of 30 dB, center frequency of 5 MHz with a fractional bandwidth of 0.5, and kernel size of 2 /spl mu/s, the standard deviation of the jitter error is on the order of few nanoseconds. Normalized correlation, normalized covariance, and SSD have an approximately equal jitter error of 2.23 ns (the value predicted by the CRLB is 2.073 ns), whereas the polarity-coincidence correlation performs less well with a jitter error of 2.74 ns.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2003.1197962","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1197962","","Ultrasonic imaging;Signal processing algorithms;Kernel;Jitter;Phase estimation;Radio frequency;Frequency estimation;Bandwidth;Delay estimation;Radar signal processing","biomedical ultrasonics;acoustic signal processing;medical signal processing;delay estimation;timing jitter","time-delay estimator;medical ultrasound;ultrasound signal processing;normalized correlations;nonnormalized correlations;normalized covariance;sum absolute differences;sum squared differences;hybrid-sign correlation;polarity-coincidence correlation;Meyr-Spies method;Cramer-Rao lower bound;signal decorrelation;signal-to-noise ratio;signal correlation;jitter error;5 MHz","Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Equipment Failure Analysis;Image Enhancement;Models, Statistical;Sensitivity and Specificity;Statistics as Topic;Stochastic Processes;Ultrasonography","152","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The fuzzy pixel-based classifier utilizes both spectral and spatial information to discriminate between spectrally similar road and building urban land cover classes. After the pixel-based classification, a technique that utilizes both spectral and spatial heterogeneity is used to segment the image to facilitate further object-based classification. An object-based fuzzy logic classifier is then implemented to improve upon the pixel-based classification by identifying one additional class in dense urban areas: nonroad, nonbuilding impervious surface. With the fuzzy pixel-based classification as input, the object-based classifier then uses shape, spectral, and neighborhood features to determine the final classification of the segmented image. Using these techniques, the object-based classifier is able to identify buildings, impervious surface, and roads in dense urban areas with 76%, 81%, and 99% classification accuracies, respectively.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.815972","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1237403","","Urban areas;Pixel;Image segmentation;Multispectral imaging;Roads;NASA;Fuzzy logic;Shape;Remote sensing;Image processing","terrain mapping;image classification;fuzzy logic;image segmentation","fuzzy pixel-based approach;object-based approach;classification;high-resolution multispectral data;urban areas;urban land cover;high-resolution multispectral image data;combined pixel/object approach;pan-sharpened multispectral IKONOS imagery;spectral information;spatial information;object-based fuzzy logic classifier","","212","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We introduce a fast incremental principal component analysis (IPCA) algorithm, called candid covariance-free IPCA (CCIPCA), used to compute the principal components of a sequence of samples incrementally without estimating the covariance matrix (so covariance-free). The new method is motivated by the concept of statistical efficiency (the estimate has the smallest variance given the observed data). To do this, it keeps the scale of observations and computes the mean of observations incrementally, which is an efficient estimate for some well known distributions (e.g., Gaussian), although the highest possible efficiency is not guaranteed in our case because of unknown sample distribution. The method is for real-time applications and, thus, it does not allow iterations. It converges very fast for high-dimensional image vectors. Some links between IPCA and the development of the cerebral cortex are also discussed.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2003.1217609","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1217609","","Principal component analysis;Covariance matrix;Image sequence analysis;Humans;Pixel;Filters;Image storage;Biology computing;Distributed computing;Image converters","principal component analysis;image processing;Gaussian distribution;real-time systems;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;covariance matrices","candid covariance-free incremental principal component analysis;appearance-based image analysis techniques;high-dimensional image vectors;candid covariance-free IPCA;covariance matrix;statistical efficiency;mean of observations;Gaussian distribution;real-time applications;eigenvector;cerebral cortex;image analysis","","285","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Modeling and simulation provides a cost-effective measure to carry out preliminary component, system (hardware and software), and mission testing and verification, thereby reducing the number of potential failures in at-sea trials. An accurate simulation can help engineers to find hidden errors in the AUV embedded software and gain insights into the AUV operations and dynamics. This paper reviews our research work on real-time physics-based modeling and simulation for our AUVs. The modeling component includes vehicle dynamics, environment and sensor characteristics. The simulation component consists of stand-alone versus hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) implementation, for both single as well as multiple vehicles.

The plate has finite size and rectangular shape. A folded dipole antenna is used and it is placed symmetrically above the plate. The FEM (finite element method) is used to simulate the dependency of antenna parameters on the size of the plate and the distance between the plate and the antenna. The presence of the metal plate, even a small one if it is at the right distance, causes very big changes in the behaviour of the antenna. The bigger the plate, especially in width, the sharper and narrower are the lobes of the radiation pattern. The antenna height defines how many lobes the radiation pattern has. A number of the antenna parameters, including impedance, directivity and front-to-back ratio, change periodically as the antenna height is increased. The resonant frequency of the antenna also changes under the influence of the metal plate.","","0-7803-7846-6","10.1109/APS.2003.1217593","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1217593","","Dipole antennas;Conductors;Resonance;Impedance;Frequency;Shape;Numerical simulation;Finite element methods;Reflector antennas;Copper","antenna radiation patterns;dipole antennas;finite element analysis;electric impedance;UHF antennas","folded dipole antenna;metal plate;antenna parameters;FEM;finite element method;radiation pattern lobes;resonant frequency;impedance;directivity;front-to-back ratio;2350 MHz","","50","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The improvements are based on the direct back EMF sensing method from our previous research work described in reference, which describes a technique for directly extracting phase back EMF information without the need to sense or re-construct the motor neutral. The reference method is not sensitive to switching noise and requires no filtering, achieving much better performance than traditional back EMF sensing scheme. A complementary PWM (synchronous rectification) is proposed to reduce the power dissipation in power devices for low voltage applications. In order to further extend the sensorless BLDC system to lower speed, a pre-conditioning circuit is proposed to amplify the back EMFs at very low speed. As a result, the brushless DC motor can run at lower speed with the improved back EMF sensing scheme. On the other hand, another improved detection circuit is presented for high voltage applications to overcome the delaying problem caused by large sensing resistors.

Eng., Univ. of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; NA","IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","","2003","12","11","1367","1377","A new set of orthogonal moments based on the discrete classical Krawtchouk polynomials is introduced. The Krawtchouk polynomials are scaled to ensure numerical stability, thus creating a set of weighted Krawtchouk polynomials. The set of proposed Krawtchouk moments is then derived from the weighted Krawtchouk polynomials. The orthogonality of the proposed moments ensures minimal information redundancy. No numerical approximation is involved in deriving the moments, since the weighted Krawtchouk polynomials are discrete. These properties make the Krawtchouk moments well suited as pattern features in the analysis of two-dimensional images. It is shown that the Krawtchouk moments can be employed to extract local features of an image, unlike other orthogonal moments, which generally capture the global features. The computational aspects of the moments using the recursive and symmetry properties are discussed. The theoretical framework is validated by an experiment on image reconstruction using Krawtchouk moments and the results are compared to that of Zernike, pseudo-Zernike, Legendre, and Tchebyscheff moments. Krawtchouk moment invariants are constructed using a linear combination of geometric moment invariants; an object recognition experiment shows Krawtchouk moment invariants perform significantly better than Hu's moment invariants in both noise-free and noisy conditions.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2003.818019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1240103","","Image analysis;Polynomials;Image reconstruction;Redundancy;Numerical stability;Pattern analysis;Data mining;Feature extraction;Object recognition;Image processing","polynomials;image reconstruction;object recognition;numerical stability;feature extraction","image analysis;Krawtchouk moment invariants;orthogonal moments;numerical stability;weighted Krawtchouk polynomials;pattern features;local feature extraction;pseudo-Zernike moments;Legendre moments;Tchebyscheff moments;object recognition;Hu moment invariants","","367","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Next, by loading three slits on the patch, the surface current path is meandered and the antenna length is reduced significantly. The IE3D simulation software is employed for optimizing the design parameters, and the simulation results in general agree with the measured data.

Depending on the situation, a peer may need to consider its trust in a specific aspect of another peer's capability or in multiple aspects. Bayesian networks provide a flexible method to present differentiated trust and combine different aspects of trust.

Typically excited to operate in the first mode, the proposed two-arm slot spiral is redesigned to operate efficiently in the second mode and in a hybrid first/second mode for better functionality. Several key features are introduced to achieve requirements for impedance matching, pattern, and gain suitable for a specific automotive dual-band DAB/SDARS (digital audio broadcasting/satellite digital audio radio services) antenna system. Among these features are new feeding systems, a suitable mix of spiral growth rates, and a low-loss spiral arm termination.

The high current peaks cause harmonic distortion of the supply current and low power factor. Introducing active power factor correction in the form of a boost pre-regulator can reduce the level of harmonics. Passive power factor correction in the form of an input filter inductor is less expensive but the component is bulky because it must be sized to handle the full power range of the supply. This paper investigates the use of variable inductance (the inductance varies with current), which provides adequate harmonic reduction. Three types of inductors are investigated: an inductor with a fixed air-gap operating with a saturated core, a swinging inductor which has a stepped gap and a novel inductor construction with a sloped air-gap (SAG). Results are presented for a 200 W power supply and it is shown that the SAG inductor has the best performance in terms of harmonic response and size.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2002.807135","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1187344","","Power factor correction;Filtering theory;Inductors;Power harmonic filters;Active filters;Power system harmonics;Inductance;Air gaps;DC-DC power converters;Rectifiers","power factor correction;inductance;AC-DC power convertors;rectifying circuits;inductors;power supplies to apparatus;air gaps;power conversion harmonics;harmonics suppression","quasi-active power factor correction;variable inductive filter;AC/DC converter;periodic current pulses;rectifier;output buffer capacitor;high current peaks;harmonic distortion;supply current;low power factor;active power factor correction;boost pre-regulator;passive power factor correction;input filter inductor;variable inductance;harmonic reduction;fixed air-gap inductor;sloped air-gap inductor;power supply","","47","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Widely used low-cost implementations of such preamplifiers typically use the buffered voltage output of an electret capacitor with a built-in JFET source follower. We describe a design in which the JFET microphone buffer's output current, rather than its output voltage, is transduced via a sense-amplifier topology allowing good in-band power-supply rejection. The design employs a low-frequency feedback loop to subtract the dc bias current of the microphone and prevent it from causing saturation. Wide-band power-supply rejection is achieved by integrating a novel filter on all current-source biasing. Our design exhibits 80 dB of dynamic range with less than 5 μV/sub rms/ of input noise while operating from a 2.8 V supply. The power consumption is 96 μW which includes 60 μW for the microphone built-in buffer. The in-band power-supply rejection ratio varies from 50 to 90 dB while out-of-band supply attenuation is greater than 60 dB until 25 MHz.

"A discussion on the significance of geometry in determining the resonant behavior of fractal and other non-Euclidean wire antennas","S. R. Best","Air Force Res. Lab., Hanscom AFB, MA, USA","IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","","2003","45","3","9","28","Fractal-shaped wire antennas have been shown to exhibit resonance compression and multi-band behavior that has primarily been attributed to the space-filling properties of the fractal geometry. Exhibiting a lower resonant frequency than a same-sized Euclidean antenna, fractal-shaped antennas can be made smaller than a Euclidean antenna that is resonant at the same frequency. While numerous fractal-shaped antennas - such as Minkowski Island fractal loops and Koch fractal monopoles -have been described in the literature, most discussions regarding these antennas have primarily focused on comparing their resonant behavior to those of simple Euclidean antennas. To understand the significance of any fractal geometry in determining the resonant behavior of the fractal-shaped antenna, it is also necessary to consider the other physical properties of the antenna. For the wire-loop antenna, these physical properties include the loop area, the total wire length, and the wire. diameter. For the wire monopole antenna, these physical properties include the monopole height, the total wire length, and the wire diameter. In the previous discussions of fractal-shaped antennas, there has been little or no comparison of the fractal antenna's performance properties with those of another wire antenna having a different non-Euclidean geometry, but otherwise having the same physical properties. While the antennas would have different geometries, they would have the same physical area or height, the same total wire length, and the same wire diameter. In this paper, the performance properties of the Minkowski Island fractal loop and the Koch fractal monopole are compared with those of other non-Euclidean-geometry antennas. It is demonstrated through numerical modeling and measurement that antennas having other non-Euclidean wire geometries offer similar and, in some cases, improved, performance over their fractal-antenna counterparts. From the analysis presented here, it is also demonstrated that antenna geometry alone - fractal or otherwise - is not the significant factor determining the resonant behavior of wire antennas.","1558-4143","","10.1109/MAP.2003.1232160","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232160","","Geometry;Resonance;Fractals;Wire;Shape;Multifrequency antennas;Resonant frequency;Solid modeling;Numerical models;Antenna measurements","wire antennas;fractals;monopole antennas;loop antennas;antenna theory","geometry;resonant behavior;nonEuclidean wire antennas;fractal-shaped wire antennas;space-filling properties;Minkowski Island fractal loops;Koch fractal monopoles;physical properties;loop area;total wire length;wire. diameter;monopole height;wire diameter;numerical modeling","","39","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Taiwan Univ., Taipei, Taiwan","IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","","2003","50","2","128","141","Sound-velocity inhomogeneities degrade both spatial and contrast resolutions. This paper proposes a new adaptive imaging technique that uses the generalized coherence factor (GCF) to reduce the focusing errors resulting from the sound-velocity inhomogeneities. The GCF is derived from the spatial spectrum of the received aperture data after proper receive delays have been applied. It is defined as the ratio of the spectral energy within a prespecified low-frequency range to the total energy. It is demonstrated that the low-frequency component of the spectrum corresponds to the coherent portion of the received data, and that the high-frequency component corresponds to the incoherent portion. Hence, the GCF reduces to the coherence factor defined in the literature if the prespecified low-frequency range is restricted to DC only. In addition, the GCF is also an index of the focusing quality and can be used as a weighting factor for the reconstructed image. The efficacy of the GCF technique is demonstrated for focusing errors resulting from the sound-velocity inhomogeneities. Simulations and real ultrasound data are used to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed GCF technique. The characteristics of the GCF, including the effects of the signal-to-noise ratio and the number of channels, are also discussed. The GCF technique also is compared with the correlation-based technique and the parallel adaptive receive compensation algorithm; the improvement in image quality obtained with the proposed technique rivals that of the latter technique. In the presence of a displaced phase screen, this proposed technique also outperforms the correlation-based technique. Computational complexity and implementation issues also are addressed.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2003.1182117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1182117","","Focusing;Degradation;Spatial resolution;Acoustic imaging;Apertures;Delay;Image reconstruction;Ultrasonic imaging;Signal to noise ratio;Image quality","adaptive signal processing;ultrasonic imaging;coherence;ultrasonic focusing;biomedical ultrasonics;computational complexity;image reconstruction","adaptive imaging technique;medical US imaging systems;generalized coherence factor;focusing error reduction;sound-velocity inhomogeneities;low-frequency component;weighting factor;reconstructed image;signal-to-noise ratio;SNR;image quality;computational complexity;adaptive weighting technique","Algorithms;Artifacts;Computer Simulation;Cysts;Feedback;Humans;Image Enhancement;Models, Biological;Phantoms, Imaging;Quality Control;Scattering, Radiation;Sensitivity and Specificity;Stochastic Processes;Transducers;Ultrasonography;Ultrasonography","179","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We have used our Raith 150 electron beam lithography tool to investigate SU-8 in two different applications. First, we investigated the properties of a specially formulated SU-8 which can be spun as thin as /spl sim/100 nm. This is much thinner than normal formulations but necessary for high-resolution lithography. We then exposed an array of single pixel lines with a pitch of 200 nm.

Second, using standard formulations of SU-8, we discovered that films as thick as 8 microns can be exposed with a 30 kV electron beam, the maximum of our system.

We obtain exact and generic expressions in M for the BER of the generalized hierarchical M-PAM (pulse amplitude modulation) constellations over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and fading channels. We also show how these expressions can be extended to generalized hierarchical M-QAM constellations (square and rectangular). For the AWGN case, these expressions are in the form of a weighted sum of complementary error functions and are solely dependent on the constellation size M, the carrier-to-noise ratio, and a constellation parameter which controls the relative message importance.

Distinguishing features include operation at X-band, single-channel operation for SAR and maritime surveillance, and two-channel operation for WAS-GMTI and integrated SAR-GMTI.

Active phased arrays are typically calibrated in a near-field antenna range at the factory. The performance of active phased array antennas would degrade over time due to changes in the characteristics of active devices and would require recalibration in the field. In this paper, we present a calibration technique for active phased array antennas that uses a small number of passive array elements dedicated to calibration. The dedicated calibration elements are passive in that they do not have T/R modules behind them.

The large-scale traffic signal control problem is divided into various subproblems, and each subproblem is handled by an intelligent agent with a fuzzy neural decision-making module. The decisions made by lower-level agents are mediated by their respective higher-level agents. Through adopting a cooperative distributed problem solving approach, coordinated control by the agents is achieved. In order for the multiagent architecture to adapt itself continuously to the dynamically changing problem domain, a multistage online learning process for each agent is implemented involving reinforcement learning, learning rate and weight adjustment as well as dynamic update of fuzzy relations using an evolutionary algorithm. The test bed used for this research is a section of the Central Business District of Singapore. The performance of the proposed multiagent architecture is evaluated against the set of signal plans used by the current real-time adaptive traffic control system. The multiagent architecture produces significant improvements in the conditions of the traffic network, reducing the total mean delay by 40% and total vehicle stoppage time by 50%.","1558-2426","","10.1109/TSMCA.2003.817394","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1245532","","Communication system traffic control;Real time systems;Computer architecture;Computational intelligence;Multiagent systems;Control systems;Large-scale systems;Intelligent agent;Fuzzy control;Decision making","traffic control;road traffic;multi-agent systems;learning (artificial intelligence);fuzzy neural nets;real-time systems;feedforward neural nets;evolutionary computation;signalling;problem solving","cooperative hybrid agent architecture;real-time traffic signal control;hybrid synergistic approach;computational intelligence concepts;cooperative hierarchical multiagent system;complex traffic network;large-scale traffic signal control problem;fuzzy neural decision-making module;cooperative distributed problem solving approach;coordinated control;multiagent architecture;continuous adaptation;dynamically changing problem domain;multistage online learning process;reinforcement learning;learning rate;weight adjustment;evolutionary algorithm;Central Business District of Singapore;traffic network conditions;total mean delay;total vehicle stoppage time","","111","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An external interstage filter between the LNAs rejects transmitter leakage to relax demodulator linearity requirements. A low-voltage demodulator topology improves linearity as well as demodulator output pole accuracy. The active-RC baseband filter uses a programmable servo loop for offset compensation and provides an adjacent channel rejection of 39 dB.

Such pairwise data often violates metricity and, therefore, cannot be naturally embedded in a vector space. Concerning the problem of unsupervised structure detection or clustering, in this paper, a new embedding method for pairwise data into Euclidean vector spaces is introduced. We show that all clustering methods, which are invariant under additive shifts of the pairwise proximities, can be reformulated as grouping problems in Euclidian spaces. The most prominent property of this constant shift embedding framework is the complete preservation of the cluster structure in the embedding space. Restating pairwise clustering problems in vector spaces has several important consequences, such as the statistical description of the clusters by way of cluster prototypes, the generic extension of the grouping procedure to a discriminative prediction rule, and the applicability of standard preprocessing methods like denoising or dimensionality reduction.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2003.1251147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1251147","","Noise reduction;Cost function;Data mining;Data analysis;Clustering methods;Clustering algorithms;Extraterrestrial measurements;Additives;Prototypes;Genomics","data analysis;pattern clustering;optimal systems;optimisation","nonmetric proximity data;optimal cluster;data analysis;feature vectors;matrix gathering pairwise proximities;unsupervised structure detection;embedding method;pairwise data;Euclidean vector spaces;clustering methods;pairwise proximities;grouping problems;prominent property;cluster structure;embedding space;pairwise clustering problems;statistical description;cluster prototypes;generic extension;grouping procedure;discriminative prediction rule;standard preprocessing methods;dimensionality reduction;denoising","","94","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes a novel Bayesian-based algorithm within the framework of wavelet analysis, which reduces speckle in SAR images while preserving the structural features and textural information of the scene. First, we show that the subband decompositions of logarithmically transformed SAR images are accurately modeled by alpha-stable distributions, a family of heavy-tailed densities. Consequently, we exploit this a priori information by designing a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator. We use the alpha-stable model to develop a blind speckle-suppression processor that performs a nonlinear operation on the data and we relate this nonlinearity to the degree of non-Gaussianity of the data. Finally, we compare our proposed method to current state-of-the-art soft thresholding techniques applied on real SAR imagery and we quantify the achieved performance improvement.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.813488","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1221775","","Image denoising;Bayesian methods;Speckle;Synthetic aperture radar;Radar scattering;Wavelet analysis;Image analysis;Image texture analysis;Information analysis;Algorithm design and analysis","geophysical techniques;geophysical signal processing;terrain mapping;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;radar imaging;Bayes methods;wavelet transforms;speckle","geophysical measurement technique;land surface;terrain mapping;radar remote sensing;synthetic aperture radar;SAR imaging;denoising;signal processing;Bayes method;multiplicative speckle noise;algorithm;wavelet analysis;subband decompositions;maximum a posteriori;estimator;SAR imagery;MAP estimator;wavelet shrinkage;heavy tailed modeling","","261","","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These power devices offer lower on-resistance and higher switching speed than SiC devices due to higher electron mobility and high channel charge density achieved by a heterojunction. The GaN epi-layers were grown on semiinsulating 4H-SiC substrate by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) technique. The device structure was grown on SiC substrates due to its high thermal conductivity. The devices have been optimised with respect to electron mobility, sheet concentration, voltage breakdown, on-resistance and dispersion. Voltage breakdown of 1300 V was achieved on small devices while breakdown in the range 600-900 V was achieved on packaged devices depending on the number of devices that have been paralleled. The power device figure of merit V/sub BR//sup 2//R/sub on/=9.94/spl times/10/sup 8/ [V/sup 2//spl middot//spl Omega//sup -1/ cm/sup -2/], where V/sub BR/ is the breakdown voltage and R/sub on/ is the on-resistance, is the highest among any reported switching devices. Switching losses of large area 600 V/2.5 A power devices were measured using resistive and inductive loading. Switching times of <30 ns were achieved with an on-resistance of 0.4 /spl Omega/ (specific on-resistance=1.7 m/spl Omega//spl middot/cm/sup 2/). The static and dynamic characteristics of GaN HEMT devices were also measured as a function of temperature up to 200/spl deg/C.

We briefly describe the simulation environment and present a study that compares three RTOSs: /spl mu/C/OS-II, a popular public-domain embedded real-time operating system; Echidna, a sophisticated, industrial-strength (commercial) RTOS; and NOS, a bare-bones multirate task scheduler reminiscent of typical ""roll-your-own"" RTOSs found in many commercial embedded systems. The microcontroller simulated in this study is the Motorola M-CORE processor: a low-power, 32-bit CPU core with 16-bit instructions, running at 20MHz. Our simulations show what happens when RTOSs are pushed beyond their limits and they depict situations in which unexpected interrupts or unaccounted-for task invocations disrupt timing, even when the CPU is lightly loaded. In general, there appears no clear winner in timing accuracy between preemptive systems and cooperative systems. The power-consumption measurements show that RTOS overhead is a factor of two to four higher than it needs to be, compared to the energy consumption of the minimal scheduler. In addition, poorly designed idle loops can cause the system to double its energy consumption-energy that could be saved by a simple hardware sleep mechanism.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2003.1244943","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1244943","","Virtual computers;Microprocessors;Operating systems;Scheduling;Power demand","embedded systems;virtual machines;microcontrollers;operating systems (computers);digital simulation;processor scheduling;power consumption","energy consumption;embedded real-time operating systems;RTOS;SimBed embedded systems;execution-driven simulation testbed;microcontroller architectural model;/spl mu/C/OS-II;Echidna;NOS;multirate task scheduler;Motorola M-CORE processor;task invocations disrupt timing;preemptive systems;cooperative systems;Chimera;power modelling;energy modelling","","33","","44","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose an adaptive approach which performs blockiness reduction in both the DCT and spatial domains to reduce the block-to-block discontinuities. For smooth regions, our method takes advantage of the fact that the original pixel levels in the same block provide continuity and we use this property and the correlation between the neighboring blocks to reduce the discontinuity of the pixels across the boundaries. For texture and edge regions, we apply an edge-preserving smoothing filter. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the blocking artifacts of still and video images as judged by both objective and subjective measures.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2003.814252","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1212659","","Discrete cosine transforms;Image coding;Filtering;Quantization;Smoothing methods;Transform coding;Frequency;Video compression;Degradation;Filters","discrete cosine transforms;transform coding;image coding;video coding;data compression;image texture;quantisation (signal);adaptive signal processing;smoothing methods","blocking artifact removal;block-based DCT compression;image compression;coarse quantization;spatial domain;texture regions;edge regions;edge-preserving smoothing filter;still images;video images;video compression","","92","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

State-of-charge (SOC), a parameter to describe how much energy battery has, is a key factor in battery management and its estimation is an important and challenging task. We develop an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to achieve the goal. First in this paper, nonconventional input variables of the ANFIS are selected by three different correlation analysis techniques, linear correlation analysis (LCA), nonparametric correlation analysis (NCA) and partial correlation analysis (PCA). Next, the ANFIS model of five inputs and one output is presented. Takagi and Sugeno's fuzzy if-then rules are used. Then, number determination of training data pairs is discussed. Finally, hybrid learning algorithm combining the gradient method and the least squares estimate (LSE) is adopted to train the ANFIS. Predicted results obtained by the ANFIS are compared with measured results, verifying presented ANFIS. For contrast, a three-layer feedforward back-propagation (BP) artificial neural network (ANN) is presented to estimate SOC. Compared with the BP ANN model, the ANFIS obtains better prediction performance when interpolating. Comparisons of the two approaches have highlighted the potential of ANFIS in modeling and prediction of the behavior of complex nonlinear dynamic systems.","","0-7803-7810-5","10.1109/FUZZ.2003.1206580","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1206580","","State estimation;Adaptive systems;Artificial neural networks;Least squares approximation;Predictive models;Nonlinear systems;Chemical processes;Battery management systems;Energy management;Input variables","backpropagation;correlation methods;learning (artificial intelligence);feedforward neural nets;fuzzy neural nets;nonlinear systems;adaptive systems;inference mechanisms;large-scale systems;least squares approximations;battery management systems;gradient methods;parameter estimation","battery state-of-charge estimation;ANFIS;adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system;nonlinear system;physical process;chemical process;battery energy;battery management;battery estimation;nonconventional input variables;correlation analysis techniques;linear correlation analysis;nonparametric correlation analysis;partial correlation analysis;Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy if-then rules;training data pairs determination;hybrid learning algorithm;gradient method;least squares estimation;three layer feedforward backpropagation network;artificial neural network;prediction performance;complex nonlinear dynamic systems;fuzzy logic;fuzzy system","","36","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accuracy of the slip frequency estimation required for RFO vector control is achieved by utilizing the parameter independent ""flux pulse"" rotor time constant estimation scheme, which utilizes short-duration pulses injected into the flux-producing current. The parameters required to tune the synchronous frame current control loops with a decoupling circuit are estimated using a recursive estimation scheme derived from the synchronous frame voltage equations.

However, for on-line system stability margin monitoring, directly measuring impedance of the source and load subsystems then making quantitative comparisons is too complicated and difficult. This paper proposes practical and simple methods, which involve applying current or voltage perturbation to the dc side of distributed power systems then only measuring the amplitude of two currents or voltages in order to monitor the stability margin.

Using a nonlocal screening approach, the model accounts for the static screening of the scattering centers produced both by electrons in the channel and in the polysilicon. Electron mobility is then calculated using a relaxation time approximation that consistently accounts for intersubband transitions and multisubband transport. Our results indicate that neglecting the screening in the polysilicon and making use of the Quantum Limit (QL) approximation can lead to a severe underestimate of the RCS limited electron mobility, thus hampering the accuracy of the predictions reported in some previous papers on this topic. Using our model, we discuss the oxide thickness dependence of the electron mobility in ultrathin gate oxide MOSFETs and the possible benefits in terms of RCS limited mobility leveraged by the use of high K dielectrics.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2003.814973","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1217252","","MOSFETs;Semiconductor device modeling;Charge carrier mobility;Charge carrier processes","MOSFET;semiconductor device models;electron mobility;impurity scattering;electron relaxation time","remote Coulomb scattering;electron mobility;numerical model;ultrathin gate oxide MOSFET;ionized impurity;polysilicon;nonlocal screening;relaxation time approximation;intersubband transition;multisubband transport;quantum limit approximation;high-K dielectric;Si","","98","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The small-scale fading observed on the backscattered signal has deeper fades than the signal from a traditional one-way link of the same range in the same environment because the fading on the backscattered signal is the product of the fading on the off-board-generated carrier times the fading on the reflected signal. This paper considers the continuous wave (CW) type of RFMB, in which the interrogator transmitter and receiver antennas are different. This two-way link also doubles the path loss exponent of the one-way link. This paper presents the cumulative distribution functions for the measured small-scale fading and the measured path loss for short ranges in an indoor environment at 2.4 GHz over this type of link.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2003.814752","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1219582","","Loss measurement;Fading;Radio frequency;Radiofrequency identification;Antenna measurements;Backscatter;Radar cross section;Freight containers;Automobile manufacture;Transmitters","indoor radio;UHF radio propagation;fading channels;electromagnetic wave absorption;loss measurement;backscatter;modulation;receiving antennas;transmitting antennas;radio links;radar cross-sections;statistical analysis","small-scale fading measurement;long range RF tags;RF modulated backscatter;modulated radar cross section;sigma modulation;RF transmission;short-range applications;nonstop toll collection;electronic shelf tags;freight container identification;chassis identification;automobile manufacture;small-scale fading;backscattered signal;off-board-generated carrier;low-data-rate applications;path loss measurement;reflected signal;continuous wave;interrogator transmitter antennas;two-way link;path loss exponent;one-way link;cumulative distribution functions;indoor environment;UHF;interrogator receiver antennas;2.4 GHz","","121","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The yield improvement and testing issues have become the most critical challenges for memory manufacturing. Conventionally, redundancies are applied so that the faulty cells can be repairable. Redundancy analysis using external memory testers is becoming inefficient as the chip density continues to grow, especially for the system chip with large embedded memories. This paper presents three redundancy analysis algorithms which can be implemented on-chip. Among them, two are based on the local-bitmap idea: the local repair-most approach is efficient for a general spare architecture, and the local optimization approach has the best repair rate. The essential spare pivoting technique is proposed to reduce the control complexity. Furthermore, a simulator has been developed for evaluating the repair efficiency of different algorithms. It is also used for determining certain important parameters in redundancy design.

The equations of motion are then programmed by MATLAB, transferred into C++ code in the MIDEVA environment, and further developed into a motion platform control program by C++Builder. To achieve the simulator functions, a motion platform that is constructed by five hydraulic cylinders is designed, and its kinetics/inverse kinetics analysis is also conducted. Driver operation signals such as steering wheel angle, accelerator pedal, and brake pedal positions are measured to trigger the vehicle dynamics calculation and further actuate the cylinders by the motion platform control program.

Three-level inversion is realised by connecting two two-level inverters in cascade, in the proposed configuration. An isolated DC power supply is used to supply each inverter in this power circuit. Each DC-link voltage is equal to half of the DC-link voltage in a conventional NPC (neutral point clamped) three-level inverter topology. Neutral point fluctuations are absent, and fast recovery neutral clamping diodes are not needed. The proposed inverter scheme produces 64 space-vector combinations distributed over 19 space-vector locations as compared to 27 combinations in a conventional three-level topology.

In this approach, one of the two conductors forming the PPW is replaced by an electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) surface. The main advantage of the proposed approach over the commonly practiced methods is the omnidirectional noise suppression it provides. For this purpose, two EBG structures are initially designed by utilizing an approximate circuit model. Subsequently, the corresponding band structures are characterized by analytical solutions using the transverse resonance method, as well as full-wave finite-element simulations. The designed EBG surfaces were fabricated and employed in a number of PPW test boards. The corresponding frequency-domain measurements exhibited bandgaps of approximately 2.21 and 3.35 GHz in the frequency range below 6 GHz. More importantly, suppression of the PPW noise by 53% was achieved based on time-domain reflectometry experiments, while maintaining the signal transmission quality within the required specifications for common signaling standards.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2003.812555","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1201796","","Periodic structures;Circuit noise;Electromagnetic interference;Metamaterials;Electromagnetic waveguides;Printed circuits;Conductors;Resonance;Finite element methods;Analytical models","periodic structures;printed circuits;parallel plate waveguides;circuit noise;interference suppression;UHF circuits;microwave circuits;finite element analysis;S-parameters;time-domain reflectometry","metallo-dielectric EBG structures;electromagnetic bandgap surface;parallel-plate noise;noise suppression;high-speed printed circuit boards;high-speed PCBs;parallel-plate waveguide;ground/power noise;periodic structures;switching noise;omnidirectional noise;approximate circuit model;transverse resonance method;full-wave finite-element simulations;FEM;time-domain reflectometry experiments;signal transmission quality;signaling standards;2.21 GHz;3.35 GHz","","267","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Design and analysis equations are developed for the multiple-beam antennas using offset parabolic-reflector antennas by including various design parameters such as the number of reflectors, the number of frequency cells, the focal-length-to-diameter (F/D) ratio, the horn efficiency, and the pointing error. The analysis employs a quasi-Gaussian beam representation for the primary and secondary patterns in order to take into account the effect of the sidelobes.

In the derivation of control laws, a limit circle is defined to confine the output power of the inverter. To determine the power that the inverter can process, the instantaneous reactive power of a 1/spl phi/ 3W system is defined and used to calculate reactive power, which can avoid complex detections of phase angle and magnitude of the fundamental component of a nonlinear load current.

One way to minimize threats in such an open community is to use community-based reputations to help evaluating the trustworthiness and predicting the future behavior of peers. We present PeerTrust - a coherent adaptive trust model for quantifying and comparing the trustworthiness of peers based on a transaction-based feedback system. There are two main features of our model. First, we introduce three basic trust parameters in computing trustworthiness of peers. In addition to feedback a peer receives through its transactions with other peers, we incorporate the total number of transactions a peer performs, and the credibility of the feedback sources into the model for evaluating the trustworthiness of peers. We argue that the trust models based solely on feedback from other peers in the community are inaccurate and ineffective. Second, we introduce two adaptive trust factors, the transaction context factor and the community context factor, to allow the basic trust metric to incorporate different contexts (situations) and to address common problems encountered in a variety of online e-commerce communities. We present a concrete method to validate the proposed trust model and report the set of simulation-based experiments, showing the feasibility and benefit of the PeerTrust model.","","0-7695-1969-5","10.1109/COEC.2003.1210262","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1210262","","Peer to peer computing;Electronic commerce;Educational institutions;Consumer electronics;Negative feedback;Performance evaluation;Concrete;Computational modeling;Distributed computing;Computer networks","security of data;electronic commerce;client-server systems;transaction processing","adaptive reputation-based trust model;peer-to-peer community;e-commerce;open community;community-based reputation;peer behavior prediction;PeerTrust;coherent adaptive trust model;peer trustworthiness;transaction-based feedback system;trust parameter;feedback-based trust model;adaptive trust factor;transaction context factor;community context factor;trust metric;online community","","88","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Comparison with a rigorous ballistic model shows that under low drain bias the ballistic mobility concept, although nonphysical, can be used to understand the experimental phenomena related to quasi-ballistic transport, such as the degradation of the apparent carrier mobility in short channel devices.

Under this framework, the goal is to maximize the net utility, defined as utility minus cost. Although UBPC is still noncooperative and distributed in nature, some degree of cooperation emerges: a user will automatically decrease its target SIR (and may even turn off transmission) when it senses that traffic congestion is building up. This framework enables us to improve system convergence and to satisfy heterogeneous service requirements (such as delay and bit error rate) for integrated networks with both voice users and data users. Fairness, adaptiveness, and a high degree of flexibility can be achieved by properly tuning parameters in UBPC.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2003.810314","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1194818","","Wireless cellular systems;Power control;Energy consumption;Costs;Distributed algorithms;Robust stability;Wireless networks;Resource management;Quality of service;Telecommunication traffic","cellular radio;radiofrequency interference;power control;telecommunication control;telecommunication traffic;error statistics;integrated voice/data communication;distributed control","utility-based power-control;wireless cellular systems;distributed power-control algorithms;signal-to-interference ratio;SIR;power consumption;softened SIR requirement;cost;traffic congestion;system convergence;heterogeneous service requirements;delay;bit error rate;integrated networks;voice users;data users;fairness","","342","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our algorithm is based on a novel application of one-way function trees. In comparison with the top-down logical key hierarchy (LKH) method of Wallner et al., our bottom-up algorithm approximately halves the number of bits that need to be broadcast to members in order to rekey after a member is added or evicted. The number of keys stored by group members, the number of keys broadcast to the group when new members are added or evicted, and the computational efforts of group members, are logarithmic in the number of group members. Among the hierarchical methods, OFT is the first to achieve an approximate halving in broadcast length, an idea on which subsequent algorithms have built. Our algorithm provides complete forward and backward security: Newly admitted group members cannot read previous messages, and evicted members cannot read future messages, even with collusion by arbitrarily many evicted members. In addition, and unlike LKH, our algorithm has the option of being member contributory in that members can be allowed to contribute entropy to the group key. Running on a Pentium II, our prototype has handled groups with up to 10 million members. This algorithm offers a new scalable method for establishing group session keys for secure large-group applications such as broadcast encryption, electronic conferences, multicast sessions, and military command and control.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2003.1199073","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1199073","","Satellite broadcasting;Cryptography;TV broadcasting;Security;Multicast algorithms;Conference management;Project management;Radio broadcasting;Algorithm design and analysis;Entropy","cryptography;protocols","shared cryptographic keys;encryption;conference keying;cryptography;cryptographic protocols;Dynamic Cryptographic Context Management;group keying;key agreement;key establishment;key management;logical key hierarchy;one-way functions;one-way function tree;secure conferences;secure group applications","","313","","60","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This VCO features differentially tuned accumulation MOS varactors that: 1) provide 40% frequency tuning when biased between 0 - 1 V and 2) diminish the adverse effect of high varactor sensitivity through rejection of common-mode noise. This paper shows that, for differential LC VCOs, all low-frequency noise such as flicker noise can be considered to be common-mode noise, and differentially tuned varactors can be used to suppress common-mode noise from being upconverted to the carrier frequency. The noise rejection mechanism is explained, and the technological advantages of SOI over bulk CMOS in this regard is discussed. At 1-MHz offset, the measured phase noise is -121.67 dBc/Hz at 3.8 GHz, and -111.67 dBc/Hz at 5.7 GHz. The power dissipation is between 2.3 - 2.7-mW, depending on the center frequency, and the buffered output power is -9 dBm.

So the new model of Pattern Recognition is called the Biomimetic Pattern Recognition (BPR). Its mathematical basis is placed on topological analysis of the sample set in the high dimensional feature space. Therefore, it is also called the Topological Pattern Recognition (TPR). The fundamental idea of this model is based on the fact of the continuity in the feature space of any one of the certain kinds of samples. We experimented with the Biomimetic Pattern Recognition (BPR) by using artificial neural networks, which act through covering the high dimensional geometrical distribution of the sample set in the feature space.

The new potential field technique uses diffeomorphic transformations and exploits the resulting point-world topology. The combined approach is applied to the problem of handling deformable material by multiple nonholonomic mobile manipulators in an obstacle environment to yield a centralized coordinating control law.

Dipole and monopole antennas based fractal Koch curves studied so far have generally been limited to certain standard configurations of the geometry. It is possible to generalize the geometry by changing its indentation angle, to vary its fractal similarity dimension. This variation results in self-similar geometry which can be generated by a recursive algorithm. Such a variation is found to have a direct influence on the input characteristics of dipole antennas. The primary resonant frequency, the input resistance at this resonance, and the ratio of first two resonant frequencies, have all been directly related to the fractal dimension. Curve-fit expressions can also be obtained for the performance of antennas at their primary resonance, in terms of fractal iteration and fractal dimension. The antenna characteristics have been studied using extensive numerical simulations and are experimentally verified. These findings underscore the significance of fractal dimension as an important mathematical property of fractals that can be used as a design parameter for antennas. The use of these ideas would not only reduce the computational intensity of optimization approaches for design of fractal shaped antennas, but also help antenna designers approach the problem systematically. Design formulation for antennas based on other fractal geometries can be similarly obtained after identifying suitable parameters of variation. This would therefore help analytical design of multiband and multifunctional antennas using fractal geometries.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2003.816352","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1229898","","Fractals;Dipole antennas;Geometry;Resonant frequency;Resonance;Multifrequency antennas;Antenna arrays;Numerical simulation;Design optimization;Wire","fractals;dipole antennas;monopole antennas;optimisation;electric resistance;antenna theory","fractal dimension;performance;multi-resonant dipole antennas;Koch curves;multiple resonant frequencies;fractal element antennas;monopole antennas;self-similar geometry;recursive algorithm;input characteristics;input resistance;curve-fit expressions;fractal iteration;numerical simulations;optimization;multiband antennas;multifunctional antennas","","103","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The technique predicts the inverter power require to correct a DC voltage error within one fundamental AC cycle. This is based on the power balance between DC input and AC output, and the energy stored in the DC link capacitor. The fast response means a smaller capacitor can be used, and operation with a large double-line-frequency ripple on the DC bus is possible without causing distortion of the AC output current. This scheme is suitable for applications where substantial DC link buffer energy is unnecessary, e.g.: grid-connected photovoltaic generators. The reliability and lifetime of the inverter can be significantly improved if a non-electrolytic type capacitor is used.

Furthermore, it overcomes stringent initial condition constraints that are present in a number of path following control strategies described in the literature. This is done by controlling explicitly the rate of progression of a ""virtual target"" to be tracked along the path, thus bypassing the problems that arise when the position of the virtual target is simply defined by the projection of the actual vehicle on that path. The nonlinear adaptive control law proposed yields convergence of the (closed loop system) path following error trajectories to zero.

The transducer membrane and cavity are defined on an SOI (silicon-on-insulator) wafer and on a prime wafer, respectively. Then, using silicon direct bonding in a vacuum environment, the two wafers are bonded together to form a transducer. This new technique, capable of fabricating large CMUTs, offers advantages over the traditionally micromachined CMUTs. First, forming a vacuum-sealed cavity is relatively easy since the wafer bonding is performed in a vacuum chamber. Second, this process enables better control over the gap height, making it possible to fabricate very small gaps (less than 0.1 μm). Third, since the membrane is made of single crystal silicon, it is possible to predict and control the mechanical properties of the membrane to within 5%. Finally, the number of process steps involved in making a CMUT has been reduced from 22 to 15, shortening the device turn-around time. All of these advantages provide repeatable fabrication of CMUTs featuring predictable center frequency, bandwidth, and collapse voltage.","1941-0158","","10.1109/JMEMS.2003.809968","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1192707","","Ultrasonic transducers;Wafer bonding;Biomembranes;Silicon on insulator technology;Process control;Mechanical factors;Fabrication;Frequency;Bandwidth;Voltage","microsensors;capacitive sensors;wafer bonding;ultrasonic transducers;silicon-on-insulator","capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers;wafer-bonding technology;CMUTs;transducer membrane;SOI;vacuum-sealed cavity;vacuum chamber;device turn-around time;center frequency;bandwidth;collapse voltage;0.1 micron;Si","","177","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Car images are taken from various positions outdoors. Because of the variations of angles from the camera to the car, license plates have various locations and rotation angles in an image. In the license plate detection phase, the magnitude of the vertical gradients is used to detect candidate license plate regions. These candidate regions are then evaluated based on three geometrical features: the ratio of width and height, the size and the orientation. The last feature is defined by the major axis. In the character recognition phase, we must detect character features that are non-sensitive to the rotation variations. The various rotated character images of a specific character can be normalized to the same orientation based on the major axis of the character image. The crossing counts and peripheral background area of an input character image are selected as the features for rotation-free character recognition. Experimental results show that the license plates detection method can correctly extract all license plates from 102 car images taken outdoors and the rotation-free character recognition method can achieve an accuracy rate of 98.6%.","","0-7803-8125-4","10.1109/ITSC.2003.1252632","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1252632","","Character recognition;Licenses;Phase detection;Image recognition;Optical character recognition software;Cameras;Optical distortion;Optical sensors;Computer vision;Image sensors","automobiles;character recognition;cameras;image recognition;computer vision","license plate character recognition;license plate character detection;camera;vertical gradient;rotation-free character recognition;image orientation","","38","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The pulse delay circuit is connected in a ring shape with 32 inverters (25 inverters). With the inverter gate-delay time as the time base, the pulse phase difference is detected simultaneously with the generation of the output clock. In this system, the phase detector and oscillator share a single ring-delay-line (RDL). This means the resolution is the same at all times, making a high-speed response possible. In a prototype integrated circuit (IC) using 0.65-μm CMOS, the generation of a frequency multiplication clock was achieved with four reference clocks, and that of a phase-locked clock with seven reference clocks, for a high-speed response. The cell size was 1.08 × 1.08 mm2, and the output clock frequency had a wide range of 50 kHz∼60 MHz. The multiplication range of the clock frequency was also a very wide 4∼1022, and a high level of precision was achieved with a clock jitter standard deviation of 234 ps.

The hygroscopic strain with respect to moisture content was found to be linear except at the initial stages of desorption where anomalous trends were observed. The swelling coefficient values obtained from the ""stable"" swelling regions were found to range from 0.3 to 0.6 (%L/%M) at 85/spl deg/C for the four types of molding compounds tested. It was also found that the swelling coefficient increased with temperature for all four types of molding compounds tested. The significance impact of hygroscopic mismatch strain was investigated by comparing the strains induced due to mismatch of the coefficient of hygroscopic swelling and the coefficient of thermal expansion for each type of molding compound when attached to a copper lead frame. The hygroscopic and thermal mismatch strains were compared using the swelling coefficient and CTE values for each type of molding compound and adjacent material (i.e., copper lead frame). Hygroscopic mismatch strains were found to be highly significant relative to the thermal mismatch strains, and they should be accounted for in the reliability modeling of packages subjected to accelerated testing. The effect of hygroscopic mismatch strains is often ignored in the reliability tests and models. In this study it is found that the hygroscopic strains can be comparable to, if not higher than, thermal mismatch strains.","1557-9972","","10.1109/TCAPT.2002.806172","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1202922","","Electronics packaging;Capacitive sensors;Testing;Moisture;Copper;Electronic packaging thermal management;Semiconductor device packaging;Semiconductor devices;Temperature;Thermal expansion","plastic packaging;semiconductor device packaging;integrated circuit packaging;polymers;moulding;swelling;moisture;desorption;thermal expansion;semiconductor device reliability;integrated circuit reliability;thermal stresses","epoxy molding compounds;electronic packaging;hygroscopic swelling;sorption characteristics;moisture induced swelling;semiconductor device packaging;hygroscopic strain;moisture content;initial desorption stages;swelling coefficient;stable swelling regions;hygroscopic mismatch strain;coefficient of thermal expansion;copper lead frame;thermal mismatch strains;hygroscopic mismatch strains;CTE;reliability modeling;accelerated testing;plastic encapsulated microelectronics;moisture diffusion test;85 C;Cu","","90","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The latter utilizes one part of an electrodynamic repulsion drive, which is concurrent with the moving double-contact system. Laboratory tests as well as computer simulations of the complete FCLCB verify, as an example, the feasibility for the goal ratings 12 kV and 2/20 kA (single phase). A cost analysis shows the FCLCB to be more expensive than a conventional generator CB, but to be in the price range of the Is-limiter and below the costs of superconducting FCL principles.

It takes into account time profiles of the objectives, various project interdependencies, logical and strategic requirements, as well as resource and benefit constraints. The third phase, finally, aims to find a portfolio which fits the decision-maker's notions. Starting with an arbitrarily selected candidate he/she iteratively sets aspiration levels for objectives or modifies upper and lower bounds. Thus, the solution space is explored until a satisfying compromise between the figures both in benefit and resource categories is reached.

Eng., Univ. of Colorado, Colorado Springs, CO, USA","IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","","2003","14","2","360","376","In this paper, we see adaptive control as a three-part adaptive-filtering problem. First, the dynamical system we wish to control is modeled using adaptive system-identification techniques. Second, the dynamic response of the system is controlled using an adaptive feedforward controller. No direct feedback is used, except that the system output is monitored and used by an adaptive algorithm to adjust the parameters of the controller. Third, disturbance canceling is performed using an additional adaptive filter. The canceler does not affect system dynamics, but feeds back plant disturbance in a way that minimizes output disturbance power.

WCNC 2003.","","2003","3","","1579","1584 vol.3","During the past few years distributed wireless sensor networks have been the focus of considerable research for both military and civil applications. Sensors are generally constrained in on-board energy supply therefore efficient management of the network is crucial to extend the life of the system. Sensors' energy cannot support long haul communication to reach a remote command site, thus they require multi-tier architecture to forward data. An efficient way to enhance the lifetime of the system is to partition the network into distinct clusters with a high-energy node called a gateway as cluster-head. Failures are inevitable in sensor networks due to the inhospitable environment and unattended deployment. However, failures in higher level of hierarchy e.g. cluster-head cause more damage to the system because they also limit accessibility to the nodes that are under their supervision. In this paper we propose an efficient mechanism to recover sensors from a failed cluster. Our approach avoids a full-scale re-clustering and does not require deployment of redundant gateways.","1525-3511","0-7803-7700-1","10.1109/WCNC.2003.1200622","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1200622","","Fault tolerance;Wireless sensor networks;Sensor systems;Sensor fusion;Military computing;Computer science;Energy management;Application software;Power generation economics;Environmental economics","fault tolerance;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network management;wireless sensor networks","fault tolerant clustering;wireless sensor networks;onboard energy supply;network management;sensor energy;multitier architecture;gateways;cluster head;inhospitable environment;full scale reclustering;network clustering;energy aware communication","","174","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Techniques to deal with these transients faults exist, but come at a cost. Designers clearly require accurate estimates of processor error rates to make appropriate cost/reliability tradeoffs. This paper describes a method for generating these estimates. A key aspect of this analysis is that some single-bit faults (such as those occurring in the branch predictor) do not produce an error in a program's output. We define a structure's architectural vulnerability factor (AVF) as the probability that a fault in that particular structure do not result in an error. A structure's error rate is the product of its raw error rate, as determined by process and circuit technology, and the AVF. Unfortunately, computing AVFs of complex structures, such as the instruction queue, can be quite involved. We identify numerous cases, such as prefetches, dynamically dead code, and wrong-path instructions, in which a fault do not affect, correct execution. We instrument a detailed 1A64 processor simulator to map bit-level microarchitectural state to these cases, generating per-structure AVF estimates. This analysis shows AVFs of 28% and 9% for the instruction queue and execution units, respectively, averaged across dynamic sections of the entire CPU2000 benchmark suite.","","0-7695-2043-X","10.1109/MICRO.2003.1253181","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253181","","Microprocessors;Circuit faults;Error analysis;Costs;Computer aided instruction;Fault diagnosis;Prefetching;Instruments;Computational modeling;Circuit simulation","microprocessor chips;integrated circuit design;fault simulation","architectural vulnerability factors;high-performance microprocessor;single-event upsets;particle strikes;microprocessor design;transients faults;processor error rates;cost-reliability tradeoff;branch predictor;structure error rate;raw error rate;instruction queue;prefetches;dynamically dead code;wrong-path instructions;processor simulator;bit-level microarchitectural state;AVF estimates;execution units;CPU2000 benchmark suite","","515","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The first analysis method is based on linear system theory and provides insight on the fundamental bandwidth limitations imposed by the /spl Delta//spl Sigma/ quantization noise in terms of rms phase error and phase-noise. To swiftly and accurately examine the effect of nonidealities on the spectral purity of the synthesizer, a fast, nonlinear analysis method is developed. Serious in-band noise leakage and reemerging spurious tones can be observed, which are in close correspondence with experimental results. Both methods are applied to distinguish the pros and cons of multistage noise-shaping (MASH) and single-loop /spl Delta//spl Sigma/ modulators in fractional- N synthesis. Based on the analysis methods, practical circuit design guidelines are compiled, with a focus on monolithic /spl Delta//spl Sigma/ fractional-N synthesizer design in CMOS with high spectral purity. These circuit design guidelines are applied to design a monolithic /spl Delta//spl Sigma/-controlled fractional-N phased-locked loop in 0.25-/spl mu/m CMOS that complies to the stringent DCS-1800 cellular specifications, which serves as a test case for experimental verification of the presented analysis methods.","1558-125X","","10.1109/TCSII.2003.819119","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1246356","","Frequency synthesizers;Circuit synthesis;Guidelines;Circuit testing;Linear systems;Bandwidth;Quantization;Phase noise;Circuit noise;Noise shaping","frequency synthesizers;delta-sigma modulation;quantisation (signal);phase locked loops;voltage-controlled oscillators;CMOS integrated circuits;phase noise;integrated circuit noise;transceivers","/spl Delta//spl Sigma/ fractional-N synthesis;frequency synthesizers;high-spectral purity;synthesizer integration;generic analysis methods;linear system theory;fundamental bandwidth limitations;quantization noise;phase error;phase-noise;nonidealities;nonlinear analysis;in-band noise leakage;reemerging spurious tones;multistage noise-shaping modulators;single-loop modulators;circuit design guidelines;CMOS phased-locked loop;PLL divider moduli;transceiver","","68","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

But for higher sampling frequencies where the sample period approaches zero for z-transform discrete systems, their dynamic response does not converge smoothly to the continuous counterpart, causing substantial implementation problems. In contrast, the response of filters based on the delta operator does converge to the continuous counterpart for smaller sample periods, and hence they are much better suited for digital control applications where sampling frequencies are much higher than the system poles. This paper describes the basis of the delta operator, its use for IIR digital filter systems, and shows how the technique can be used in power electronic inverter applications to achieve substantial performance benefits compared to equivalent shift-based implementations. A brief review of shift based IIR filtering is presented and the required conversions to the delta form given. The specific examples of an active filter and a P + Resonant current regulator are used to illustrate the improvements that can be expected. The superior performance of the delta operator for digital control of inverter applications has been verified in both simulation and experiment.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2002.807105","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1187464","","Digital filters;Inverters;IIR filters;Active filters;Power electronics;Sampling methods;Frequency;Digital control;Filtering;Resonance","digital filters;IIR filters;digital control;Z transforms;dynamic response;invertors;electric current control","delta operator digital filters;high performance inverter;infinite impulse response digital filter implementations;power electronic inverter applications;time shift operator;z-transform;higher sampling frequencies;discrete systems;dynamic response;sampling frequencies;delta operator;IIR digital filter systems;P+Resonant current regulator;digital control;shift operator","","74","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The second one discharges the outputs at slightly above the threshold voltage. The third one uses charge sharing to attain approximately half the supply voltage at both outputs. Preliminary simulation shows that the charge sharing technique yields lowest power consumption of 90 /spl mu/W at 100 MHz. All three comparators have an offset voltage in the range of 30-150 mV.","","0-7803-8162-9","10.1109/TENCON.2003.1273237","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1273237","","Latches;Capacitance;Threshold voltage;Energy consumption;Pipelines;Resistors;Coupling circuits;Analog-digital conversion;Switching circuits;Circuit topology","comparators (circuits);power consumption;CMOS integrated circuits;analogue-digital conversion;linear network analysis","CMOS dynamic latch comparators;pipeline analog-to-digital converters;differential comparing circuit;variable resistors;charge sharing;power consumption;90 muW;100 MHz;30 to 150 mV","","20","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Eng., Minnesota Univ., USA","IEEE Transactions on Communications","","2003","51","12","2047","2056","While rapid variations of the fading channel cause intercarrier interference (ICI) in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), thereby degrading its performance considerably, they also introduce temporal diversity, which can be exploited to improve performance. We first derive a matched-filter bound (MFB) for OFDM transmissions over doubly selective Rayleigh fading channels, which benchmarks the best possible performance if ICI is completely canceled without noise enhancement. We then derive universal performance bounds which show that the time-varying channel causes most of the symbol energy to be distributed over a few subcarriers, and that the ICI power on a subcarrier mainly comes from several neighboring subcarriers. Based on this fact, we develop low-complexity minimum mean-square error (MMSE) and decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) receivers for ICI suppression. Simulations show that the DFE receiver can collect significant gains of ICI-impaired OFDM with affordable complexity. In the relatively low Doppler frequency region, the bit-error rate of the DFE receiver is close to the MFB.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2003.820752","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1256744","","Interference suppression;OFDM;Fading;Decision feedback equalizers;Frequency division multiplexing;Time-varying channels;Bit error rate;Degradation;Bandwidth;Narrowband","adjacent channel interference;decision feedback equalisers;least mean squares methods;interference suppression;mobile radio;Rayleigh channels;time-varying channels;OFDM modulation;diversity reception;matched filters;radio receivers;computational complexity;Doppler effect;error statistics","intercarrier interference suppression;wireless mobile OFDM;fading channel;ICI suppression;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;temporal diversity;matched-filter bound;doubly selective fading channels;Rayleigh fading channels;universal performance bounds;time-varying channel;low-complexity minimum mean-square error receivers;MMSE receivers;decision-feedback equalizer receivers;DFE receivers;complexity;Doppler frequency region;bit-error rate","","267","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The recent advances in model-based design technology have realized significant time savings in product development cycle. These advances facilitate the integration of model-based diagnosis and prognosis of systems, leading to condition-based maintenance and increased availability of systems. With an accurate simulation model of a system, diagnostics and prognostics can be synthesized concurrently with system design. In this paper, we develop an integrated prognostic process based on data collected from model-based simulations under nominal and degraded conditions. Prognostic models are constructed based on different random load conditions (modes). An interacting multiple model (IMM) is used to track the hidden damage.

We present an ACC controller based on fuzzy logic, which assists the speed and distance vehicle control, offering driving strategies and actuation over the throttle of a car. The driving information is supplied by the car tachometer and a RTK differential GPS, and the actuation over the car is made through an electronic interface that simulates the electrical signal of the accelerator pedal directly to the onboard computer.

One or more conductors (depending on the specific supply system) are purposely set up to carry the traction return current flowing from the rolling stock axles back to the supply (i.e., substation); yet, part of the return current flows through signalling conductors (disturbing current) and through the earth, depending on the value of the electric parameters of the system, on the circuit arrangement, and on the relative position of the supply, the rolling stock, and signalling devices. The amplitude (as a percentage of the total return current) of the disturbing current may be high enough to cause interference to signalling. This work investigates the behavior of the return current in AC and DC electric railway systems, on the basis of a reference system for the variation of the most important electrical parameters. The definition of the transfer function between the return current and the signalling circuit variables is an important element for the compatibility analysis between train detection systems, rolling stock and infrastructure, to promote the cross-acceptance of rolling stock in Europe and abroad.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2003.817786","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1234702","","Rail transportation;Conductors;Circuits;Axles;Substations;Earth;Interference;Transfer functions;Signal analysis;Europe","railways;traction power supplies;current distribution;signalling;conductors (electric);electromagnetic compatibility;electromagnetic interference","traction return current distribution;DC electric railway systems;AC electric railway systems;conductors;rolling stock axles;substation;signalling conductors;disturbing current;circuit arrangement;rolling stock;signalling devices;compatibility analysis;train detection systems;Europe;power system harmonies;power distribution interference;guideway transportation power systems;25 kV;3000 V","","49","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Especially, zero-IF receivers are very appealing, because they avoid costly IF filters. However, this implies IQ demodulation at RF, which therefore cannot be done digitally and thus introduces IQ mismatch. Unfortunately, OFDM is very sensitive to receiver IQ imbalance. Therefore, we developed a new compensation scheme to combat the IQ imbalance at baseband. In this paper, we describe the algorithm and represent the performance results. Our compensation scheme eliminates the IQ imbalance almost perfect. This leads to tremendous improvements, especially in multi-path channels (up to 10 dB performance gain), and enables low-cost zero-IF receivers.","","0-7803-7802-4","10.1109/ICC.2003.1204086","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1204086","","Degradation;Baseband;Filters;Demodulation;Radio frequency;Performance gain;OFDM modulation;AWGN channels;Channel estimation;Equations","compensation;OFDM modulation;receivers;multipath channels;channel estimation;demodulation","IQ imbalance compensation;OFDM systems;IQ demodulation;baseband;multipath channels;low-cost zero-IF receivers;intermediate frequency;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;channel estimation;10 dB","","66","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This converter is conceiving to be used as a controlled energy-transfer-equipment between the main energy source of an electric vehicle (a battery pack in this case) and an auxiliary energy system based on ultracapacitors. The converter is able to transfer energy in both directions, at rates of more than 40 kW. The battery pack's nominal voltage is 330 V, while the ultracapacitor's voltage depends on their state of charge (SOC), ranging from 100 V to 300 V. Equations governing current transfer and current ripple are analyzed. These equations will be used as guidelines for the control system design and smoothing inductor size requirement. The topology used is a buck-boost configuration. Special care had to be taken in designing the smoothing inductor and managing thermal loses, for these are critical to the overall performance. The inductor constructed, rating l.5 mH, is capable of transferring 200 A for several minutes with low loses and no core saturation (air core was used). A special water-cooled heatsink was designed and constructed, with a very low volume of less than 900 cc and a thermal resistance of less than 0.011/spl deg/C/W. The control system was implemented on a TMS320F241 DSP from Texas Instruments, which consists in two control loops. The first one controls the converter's current, using as a reference the value obtained from the second loop, which controls the ultracapacitors state of charge (SOC). Criteria ruling this second loop are not discussed in this paper.

One reason for this expense is the Federal Aviation Administration's requirement that test suites be modified condition/decision coverage (MC/DC) adequate. Despite its cost, there is evidence that MC/DC is an effective verification technique and can help to uncover safety faults. As the software is modified and new test cases are added to the test suite, the test suite grows and the cost of regression testing increases. To address the test-suite size problem, researchers have investigated the use of test-suite reduction algorithms, which identify a reduced test suite that provides the same coverage of the software according to some criterion as the original test suite, and test-suite prioritization algorithms, which identify an ordering of the test cases in the test suite according to some criteria or goals. Existing test-suite reduction and prioritization techniques, however, may not be effective in reducing or prioritizing MC/DC-adequate test suites because they do not consider the complexity of the criterion. This paper presents new algorithms for test-suite reduction and prioritization that can be tailored effectively for use with MC/DC. The paper also presents the results of empirical studies of these algorithms.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2003.1183927","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1183927","","Software testing;Software algorithms;Costs;System testing;Software maintenance;Computer Society;Safety;FAA;Performance evaluation;Software performance","program testing;performance evaluation","critical software;software testing;commercial airborne systems;test suites;modified condition/decision coverage;test-suite prioritization","","177","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This method is based on the simulation of physically plausible, biomechanical tissue deformations using finite-element methods. Applying a range of displacements to finite-element models of different patient anatomies generates model solutions which simulate gold standard deformations. From these solutions, deformed images are generated with a range of deformations typical of those likely to occur in vivo. The registration accuracy with respect to the finite-element simulations is quantified by co-registering the deformed images with the original images and comparing the recovered voxel displacements with the biomechanically simulated ones. The functionality of the validation method is demonstrated for a previously described nonrigid image registration technique based on free-form deformations using B-splines and normalized mutual information as a voxel similarity measure, with an application to contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance mammography image pairs. The exemplar nonrigid registration technique is shown to be of subvoxel accuracy on average for this particular application. The validation method presented here is an important step toward more generic simulations of biomechanically plausible tissue deformations and quantification of tissue motion recovery using nonrigid image registration. It will provide a basis for improving and comparing different nonrigid registration techniques for a diversity of medical applications, such as intrasubject tissue deformation or motion correction in the brain, liver or heart.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2002.808367","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1194634","","Image registration;Finite element methods;Breast;Deformable models;Medical simulation;Biomedical imaging;Anatomy;Gold;Image generation;In vivo","biomedical MRI;mammography;biological organs;finite element analysis;image registration;medical image processing;biomechanics;biological tissues;physiological models","nonrigid medical image registration;simulation;biomechanical tissue deformations;finite-element methods;breast MR images;displacements;patient anatomies;model solutions;gold standard deformations;registration accuracy;deformed image co-registration;voxel displacements;free-form deformations;B-splines;normalized mutual information;voxel similarity measure;contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance mammography image pairs;subvoxel accuracy;generic simulations;intrasubject tissue deformation;motion correction;brain;liver;heart","Artifacts;Breast;Breast Neoplasms;Breast Neoplasms;Echo-Planar Imaging;Echo-Planar Imaging;Female;Finite Element Analysis;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Motion;Quality Control;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","172","","42","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For real-world images, the contrasts of K/sub R/ and K/sub B/ are quite flat over a small region and this property is suitable for interpolation. The main contribution of this paper is that we propose a low-complexity interpolation method to improve the image quality. We show that the frequency response of the proposed method is better than the conventional methods. Simulation results also verify that the proposed method obtain superior image quality on typical images. The luminance channel of the proposed method outperforms by 6.34-dB peak SNR the bilinear method, and the chrominance channels have a 7.69-dB peak signal-to-noise ratio improvement on average.

Tsing Hua Univ., Hsin-Chu, Taiwan; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","","2003","39","3","844","853","Voltage sags have become one of the most important power quality concerns in recent years. According to survey results across the US, voltage sags and short-duration power outages account for 92% of power quality problems encountered by industrial customers. Voltage sags often cause undervoltage faults in various sensitive loads and subsequently interrupt the manufacturing processes. Such interruptions often inflict severe losses for industries. In Taiwan, ROC, most high-tech manufacturers use uninterruptible power supplies to avoid interruptions, but the cost effectiveness of such an approach remains unclear. As the utility grid continues to improve the reliability of electric power, the inverter-based voltage sag compensator has become a viable solution to prevent production interruptions resulting from voltage sags. The existing sag compensation systems accomplish a fast response within a small fraction of a fundamental cycle by tracking the line voltages closely, and switch on the compensator whenever the voltage waveforms deviate from the normal values. However, the utility voltages often contain transient spikes with amplitudes up to 200% resulting from switching of power-factor-correction capacitors, circuit breakers switchings, lightning strikes, and so on. Such transient disturbances may trigger the sag compensator into operation if its controller is very sensitive. The switching frequency of the sag compensator inverter is inadequate to compensate the narrow pulses of voltage spikes. Furthermore, the power semiconductor devices (like insulated gate bipolar transistors) of the inverter may also be damaged due to overvoltage by the surges. In this paper, a brief overview of power quality issues of a high-tech industry park in Taiwan is provided to validate the need for ride-through technologies. A synchronous-reference-frame-based controller for the inverter-based voltage sag compensator is also presented. A sag detection mechanism is included in the controller for correct and prompt identification of voltage sags. Disturbances like voltage spikes are attenuated to avoid any false triggering of the compensator. The overall system responds to voltage sags and restores the voltage back to balanced 1.0 pu for critical loads within one-eighth to one-fourth of a cycle, which meet the requirement of industry standards like the SEMI-F47 standard. Simulation and laboratory test results are presented to verify the functionality of the proposed system.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2003.811780","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1201554","","Voltage fluctuations;Power quality;Voltage control;Manufacturing industries;Switching circuits;Power semiconductor switches;Inverters;Circuit faults;Manufacturing processes;Uninterruptible power systems","power supply quality;compensation;power factor correction;power capacitors;invertors;circuit breakers;power system faults","series voltage sag compensator;utility conditions;short-duration power outages;power quality problems;industrial customers;undervoltage faults;sensitive loads;manufacturing processes interruption;Taiwan;high-tech manufacturers;uninterruptible power supplies;inverter-based voltage sag compensator;line voltages tracking;voltage waveforms;transient spikes;power-factor-correction capacitors;circuit breakers switching;lightning strikes;transient disturbances;sag compensator;switching frequency;sag compensator inverter;voltage spikes;power semiconductor devices;insulated gate bipolar transistors;ride-through technologies;synchronous-reference-frame-based controller;sag detection mechanism;false triggering avoidance;SEMI-F47 standard","","64","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Differences in capacitance and quality factor are shown. Two identical VCOs with the varactors having n gates or np gates are realized. Homogenous doping increases the VCO tuning range to 1.31 GHz (±20%) in comparison to 1.06 GHz (±15%) obtained by mixed doping. However, mixed doping has the advantages of more linear VCO frequency tuning, lower close-in phase noise, and reduced maximum sensitivity to variations in supply voltage. Several varactor parameters are introduced. They allow prediction of the influence of varactors on the performance of a given VCO.

We present a method for learning object categories from just a few images (1 /spl sim/ 5). It is based on incorporating ""generic"" knowledge which may be obtained from previously learnt models of unrelated categories. We operate in a variational Bayesian framework: object categories are represented by probabilistic models, and ""prior"" knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The ""posterior"" model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. Our ideas are demonstrated on four diverse categories (human faces, airplanes, motorcycles, spotted cats). Initially three categories are learnt from hundreds of training examples, and a ""prior"" is estimated from these. Then the model of the fourth category is learnt from 1 to 5 training examples, and is used for detecting new exemplars a set of test images.","","0-7695-1950-4","10.1109/ICCV.2003.1238476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1238476","","Bayesian methods;Humans;Computer vision;Probability density function;Cats;Face detection;Airplanes;Motorcycles;Testing;Animals","computer vision;unsupervised learning;Bayes methods;Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;face recognition","Bayesian method;unsupervised one-shot learning;object categories;learning visual models;probabilistic models;prior knowledge;probability density function;posterior model;human faces;airplanes;motorcycles;spotted cats;computer vision;maximum likelihood;Markov-chain Monte Carlo method;Direchlet distribution;Wishart density;Digamma function;expectation maximization","","94","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper investigates a new potential application of coordinated secondary voltage control by multiple FACTS voltage controllers in eliminating voltage violations in power system contingencies. The study is presented by the example New England ten-machine power system with two SVCs and two STATCOMs installed. The coordinated secondary voltage control is assigned to the SVCs and STATCOMs in order to eliminate voltage violations in system contingencies. In the paper, it is proposed that the secondary voltage control is implemented by a learning fuzzy logic controller. A key parameter of the controller is trained by P-type learning algorithm via offline simulation with the assistance of injection of artificial loads in controller's adjacent locations. A multiagent collaboration protocol, which is graphically represented as a finite-state machine, is proposed in the paper for the coordination among multiple SVCs and STATCOMs. As an agent, each SVC or STATCOM can provide multilocation coverage to eliminate voltage violations at its adjacent nodes in the power system. Agents can provide collaborative support to each other which is coordinated according to the proposed collaboration protocol.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2003.810896","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1198290","","Voltage control;Power system control;Power systems;Power system stability;Automatic voltage control;Collaboration;Protocols;Control systems;Fuzzy logic;Static VAr compensators","power system control;voltage control;flexible AC transmission systems;fuzzy control;static VAr compensators;power system dynamic stability;multi-agent systems","coordinated secondary voltage control;voltage violations elimination;power system voltage stability margin;FACTS voltage controllers;New England ten-machine power system;SVC;STATCOM;static VAr compensators;learning algorithm;multi-agent theory;fuzzy logic controller;P-type learning algorithm;offline simulation;artificial loads injection;multiagent collaboration protocol;finite-state machine;multilocation coverage","","70","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Of the two research methods employed, the first was a quantitative field study of knowledge workers. The instrument measured the extent to which respondents and their organizations are influenced by advanced technology cultures. Using partial least squares (PLS), the first of two models tested links between SNs; technological culturation and Internet usage for each respondent. The second model investigated links between technological culturation and Internet utilization for the respondent's organization. Findings show strong support for both models, explaining, respectively, 47% and 37% of the variance. The second method was a qualitative analysis of respondents' free-format comments. These findings reinforce the quantitative findings, on the one hand, and reveal additional cultural barriers that still need to be studied, on the other.

Many analog and digital approaches have been proposed for suppressing these interferences, and amongst these, rejection of the pulsive type of interferences is known to be very difficult, if not impossible. The time and frequency characteristics of the pulsive interference being very similar to that of the PD pulses is the main reason posing difficulty in their separation. In this paper, a novel, semi-automatic, and empirical wavelet-based method (using multi-resolution signal analysis) is proposed to recover PD pulses, buried in excessive noise/interference comprising of random, discrete spectral, pulsive, and any combination of these interferences occurring simultaneously and overlapping-in-time with the PD pulses. A critical assessment of the proposed method is carried out, by processing both simulated and practically acquired PD signals. The results obtained are also compared with those from the best digital filter (infinite impulse response, IIR and finite impulse response, FIR) method proposed in literature. From the results it emerges that, the wavelet approach is superior and further, has the unique capability of successfully rejecting all the three kinds of interferences, even when PD signals and one or all interferences occur simultaneously and overlap-in-time.","1558-4135","","10.1109/TDEI.2003.1194122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1194122","","Noise reduction;Partial discharges;Interference suppression;Partial discharge measurement;Stochastic resonance;Frequency;Wavelet analysis;Discrete wavelet transforms;Signal analysis;Signal processing","insulation testing;partial discharge measurement;wavelet transforms;interference suppression;signal processing","partial discharge signals;wavelet-based denoising;insulation breakdown testing;partial discharge measurements;interferences suppression;multi-resolution signal analysis;PD pulses;digital filter;infinite impulse response filter;IIR filter;finite impulse response filter","","185","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

So far, material and topology optimization has not been pursued primarily due to the challenges associated with the fabrication of inhomogeneous materials and the limited access to analysis tools. In this paper, we focus on optimum topology/material design of dielectric substrates for bandwidth enhancement of a simple patch antenna. First, the possibility of designing arbitrary dielectric constant materials using off-the-shelf dielectrics is presented as is necessary for the practical fabrication of inhomogeneous substrates. Then, a formal design optimization procedure is conducted using the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) method by relying on a fast full wave finite element-boundary integral (FE-BI) simulator. The SIMP method is a mathematically well-posed topology optimization algorithm because a continuous density function is used to relate the cell variable to the actual material properties. This also allows for a formulation in a versatile optimization framework. Sequential linear programming (SLP) is used to solve the nonlinear optimization procedure with the sensitivity analysis based on the adjoint variable method. An important advantage of the proposed design optimization approach is its generality to handle multiple objectives and multidisciplinary problems. Using the proposed automated design procedure, inhomogeneous substrates are designed which allow for 250% bandwidth enhancement of the square patch antenna. Typically, only a few iterations are needed to reach convergence. Finally, the designed substrate is post-processed with image processing and fabricated using thermoplastic green machining.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2003.817539","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1236091","","Topology;Design optimization;Dielectric substrates;Bandwidth;Patch antennas;Dielectric materials;Conducting materials;Fabrication;Optimization methods;Radio frequency","linear programming;microstrip antennas;antenna accessories;substrates;finite element analysis;boundary integral equations;broadband antennas;dielectric materials","topology design optimization;dielectric substrates;bandwidth improvement;patch antenna;fabrication;inhomogeneous materials;bandwidth enhancement;dielectric constant materials;inhomogeneous substrates;solid isotropic material with penalization;SIMP;fast full wave finite element-boundary integral simulator;FE-BI simulator;continuous density function;cell variable;sequential linear programming;nonlinear optimization procedure;sensitivity analysis;adjoint variable method;automated design procedure;square patch antenna;iteration;convergence;thermoplastic green machining","","100","","44","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A nonunitary transform, based on the simultaneous diagonalization of the clean speech and noise covariance matrices, is used to project the noisy signal onto a signal-plus-noise subspace and a noise subspace. The clean signal is estimated by nulling the signal components in the noise subspace and retaining the components in the signal subspace. The applied transform has built-in prewhitening and can therefore be used in general for colored noise. The proposed approach is shown to be a generalization of the approach proposed by Y. Ephraim and H.L. Van Trees (see ibid., vol.3, p.251-66, 1995) for white noise. Two estimators are derived based on the nonunitary transform, one based on time-domain constraints and one based on spectral domain constraints.

Multiaccess signal interference is explicitly modeled. We use a duality approach whereby, as a byproduct of finding the optimal policy, we find the sensitivity of the minimal total average power with respect to the average data rate for each link. Since the minimal total average power is a convex function of the required minimum average data rates, shortest path algorithms with the link weights set to the link sensitivities can be used to guide the search for a globally optimum routing. We present a few simple examples that show our algorithm can find policies that support data rates that are not possible with conventional approaches. Moreover, we find that optimum allocations do not necessarily route traffic over minimum energy paths.","0743-166X","0-7803-7752-4","10.1109/INFCOM.2003.1208720","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1208720","","Routing;Power control;Intelligent networks;Spread spectrum communication;Wireless networks;Processor scheduling;Transmitters;Interference constraints;Frequency;Femtocell networks","telecommunication control;scheduling;broadband networks;radio links;telecommunication network routing;power control","optimal network routing;network link scheduling;network power control;multihop wireless network;broadband wireless multihop network;average transmission power;transmission power constraint;multiaccess signal interference;duality approach;minimal total average power sensitivity;average data rate;shortest path algorithm;link weight;minimum energy path","","242","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, it is of the utmost importance to government, business, and the public at large that the flow of services provided by a nation's infrastructure continues unimpeded in the face of a broad range of natural and manmade hazards. From a comprehensive vulnerability assessment and hazard mitigation standpoint, it is necessary to look beyond the effects of an event on a single system and instead seek to understand the perturbed behaviors of a complex, ""system of systems"".

Before computation for two input data, the one with a smaller effective dynamic range is processed to generate Booth codes, thereby increasing the probability that the partial products become zero. By employing the dynamic-range determination unit to control input data paths, the multiplier with a column-based adder tree of compressors or counters is designed. To further reduce power consumption, the two multipliers based on row-based and hybrid-based adder trees are realized with operations on effective dynamic ranges of input data. Functional blocks of these two multipliers can preserve their previous input states for noneffective dynamic data ranges and thus, reduce the number of their switching operations. To illustrate the proposed multipliers exhibiting low-power dissipation, the theoretical analyzes of switching activities of partial products are derived. The proposed 16 /spl times/ 16-bit multiplier with the column-based adder tree conserves more than 31.2%, 19.1%, and 33.0% of power consumed by the conventional multiplier, in applications of the ADPCM audio, G.723.1 speech, and wavelet-based image coders, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed multipliers with row-based, hybrid-based adder trees reduce power consumption by over 35.3%, 25.3% and 39.6%, and 33.4%, 24.9% and 36.9%, respectively. When considering product factors of hardware areas, critical delays and power consumption, the proposed multipliers can outperform the conventional multipliers. Consequently, the multipliers proposed herein can be broadly used in various media processing to yield low-power consumption at limited hardware cost or little slowing of speed.","1557-9999","","10.1109/TVLSI.2003.810788","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1218215","","Product design;Energy consumption;Dynamic range;Adders;Power dissipation;Compressors;Counting circuits;Hardware;Microelectronics;Capacitance","low-power electronics;multiplying circuits;adders;delays;wavelet transforms;digital arithmetic","switching activities;partial products;low-power multipliers;2's complement multipliers;radix-4 Booth algorithm;effective dynamic range;Booth codes;dynamic-range determination unit;column-based adder tree;row-based adder trees;hybrid-based adder trees;noneffective dynamic data ranges;switching operations;low-power dissipation;ADPCM audio;G.723.1 speech;wavelet-based image coders;critical delays;16 bit","","47","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These drawbacks can often be-at least partially-overcome by carrying out measurements on a subset of image pixels corresponding to natural or artificial stable reflectors [permanent scatterers (PS)] and exploiting long temporal series of interferometric data.

Our method uses an integer linear program to determine new locations for the base stations and a flow-based routing protocol to ensure energy efficient routing during each round. We propose four metrics and evaluate our solution using these metrics. Based on the simulation results we show that employing multiple, mobile base stations in accordance with the solution given by our schemes would significantly increase the lifetime of the sensor network.","","0-7803-7974-8","10.1109/GLOCOM.2003.1258265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1258265","","Energy efficiency;Wireless sensor networks;Base stations;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Routing protocols;Media Access Protocol;Mobile computing;Computer science;Computer network management;Energy management","wireless sensor networks;mobile radio;routing protocols;integer programming;linear programming","wireless sensor networks;multiple mobile base stations;flow-based routing protocol;integer linear program","","264","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In such a scenario, it is essential to establish correspondence between tracks of the same object, seen in different cameras, to recover complete information about the object. We call this the problem of consistent labeling of objects when seen in multiple cameras. We employ a novel approach of finding the limits of field of view (FOV) of each camera as visible in the other cameras. We show that, if the FOV lines are known, it is possible to disambiguate between multiple possibilities for correspondence. We present a method to automatically recover these lines by observing motion in the environment, Furthermore, once these lines are initialized, the homography between the views can also be recovered. We present results on indoor and outdoor sequences containing persons and vehicles.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2003.1233912","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1233912","","Labeling;Cameras;Surveillance;Computer vision;Application software;Vehicles;Sensor fusion;Humans;Motion analysis;Computerized monitoring","motion estimation;optical tracking;cameras;sensor fusion","consistent labeling;tracked objects;multiple cameras;overlapping fields of view;moving object tracking;multiple uncalibrated cameras;surveillance setups;complete information recovery;consistent object labeling;field of view;FOV lines;homography;indoor sequences;outdoor sequences;multiperspective video;camera handoff;sensor fusion","","250","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This task has various kinds of problems, such as obstacle avoidance and stable manipulation. All of these problems cannot be solved at once, since it would result in a dramatic increase of the computational time. Accordingly, we divided the motion planner into a global path planner and a local manipulation planner, designed them, and integrated them. The aim was to integrate a gross motion planner and a fine motion planner. Concerning the global path planner, we reduced the dimensions of the configuration space (C-space) using the feature of transportation by mobile robots. We used the potential field to find the solution by searching in this smaller-dimension reconstructed C-space. In the global path planner, the constraints of the object manipulation are considered as the cost function and the heuristic function in the A/sup */ search. For the local manipulation planner, we developed a manipulation technique, which is suitable for mobile robots by position control. We computed the conditions in which the object becomes unstable during manipulation and generated each robot's motion, considering the robots' motion errors and indefinite factors from the planning stage. We verified the effectiveness of our proposed motion planning method through simulations.","2374-958X","","10.1109/TRA.2003.809592","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1192151","","Motion planning;Mobile robots;Transportation;Motion-planning;Cost function;Position control;Computational modeling;Manufacturing;Fault tolerance;Robotics and automation","path planning;mobile robots;collision avoidance;mechatronics","motion planning;multiple mobile robots;cooperative manipulation;cooperative transportation;obstacle avoidance;stable manipulation;global path planner;local manipulation planner;configuration space;object manipulation;cost function;heuristic function","","96","","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This method appears to be a robust alternative for pattern recognition with hyperspectral data: since the method is based on a geometric point of view, no statistical estimation has to be achieved. Then, SVM outperforms classical supervised classification algorithms such as the maximum likelihood when the number of spectral bands increases or when the number of training samples remains limited. Nevertheless, those kernel-based methods do not take into consideration the spectral similarity between support vectors. Then, some modified kernels are presented to take into consideration the spectral similarity between support vectors to outperform SVM-based classification of hyperspectral data cube. Those kernels (that still suit Mercer's conditions) are based on the use of spectral angle to evaluate the distance between support vectors. Classifiers to compare have been applied to an image from the CASI sensor including 17 bands from 450 to 950nm representing an intensive agricultural region (Brittany, France). It appears that those kernels reduce false alarms that were induced by illumination effects with classical kernels.","","0-7803-7929-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2003.1293752","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1293752","","Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Hyperspectral imaging;Image classification;Kernel;Hyperspectral sensors;Robustness;Pattern recognition;Classification algorithms;Maximum likelihood estimation","image classification;support vector machines;geophysical techniques;geophysical signal processing;agriculture;spectral analysis","support vector machines;hyperspectral image classification;spectral-based kernels;SVM-based classification;pattern recognition;spectral bands;kernel-based methods;spectral similarity;hyperspectral data cube;Mercer conditions;spectral angle;CASI sensor;agricultural region;Brittany;France;illumination effects;maximum likelihood;classification algorithm;450 to 950 nm","","82","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is the case, for example, if one wants to remove JPEG artifacts or for JPEG re-compression. In this paper, a fast and efficient method is provided to determine whether an image has been previously JPEG compressed. After detecting a compression signature, we estimate compression parameters. Specifically, we developed a method for the maximum likelihood estimation of JPEG quantization steps.

However, since the converter always operates at the boundary of discontinuous and continuous-conduction-modes under both steady state and transient conditions, the inductor can be removed from the average large-signal model. In fact, the control-to-output transfer function can be accurately described with its current loop closed at frequencies less than half of the switching frequency. The model is extended to the ringing-choke converter, which is a common type of variable-frequency flyback converter used in many cost-sensitive applications.

Since the thermal properties of thin films, such as SiO/sub 2/, can vary considerably from bulk values, the determination of those properties (as well as the interface resistance between SiO/sub 2/ and adjacent layers) is critical for the purposes of design. In this work, a transient thermo-reflectance system has been employed to measure the thermal characteristics of thin-film SiO/sub 2/ layers. Results show that for layers of SiO/sub 2/ in the range of 100-1000 /spl Aring/, the intrinsic thermal conductivity (TC) is independent of thickness and smaller than the traditionally reported value of bulk silicon dioxide (1.4 W/m-K). The intrinsic value was measured to be around 90% (1.27 W/m-k) and 75% (1.05 W/m-k) of the latter bulk value for thermally grown (TG) and ion beam sputtered (IBS) oxides, respectively. The thermal interface resistances of TG and IBS SiO/sub 2/ films were measured at 1.68 /spl times/ 10/sup -8/ m/sup 2/-K/W and 2.58 /spl times/ 10/sup -8/ m/sup 2/-K/W, respectively. If a chromium film of around 100 /spl Aring/ is deposited between the gold and SiO/sub 2/ layers, the interface thermal resistance improves to 0.78 /spl times/ 10/sup -8/ m/sup 2/-K/W for TG films and 1.15 /spl times/ 10/sup -8/ m/sup 2/-K/W for IBS films. Thus, the effective thermal resistance of SiO/sub 2/ thin-films (i.e., with interface effects) is up to one order of magnitude smaller than the values reported for bulk SiO/sub 2/.","1557-9972","","10.1109/TCAPT.2003.811467","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1202906","","Semiconductor thin films;Silicon compounds;Thermal resistance;Transistors;Electrical resistance measurement;Thermal management of electronics;Thermal conductivity;Materials reliability;Thermal management;Ion beams","gold;silicon compounds;dielectric thin films;thermal analysis;chromium;heat transfer;thermal resistance measurement;sputtered coatings;thermal conductivity measurement;metallic thin films;thermal management (packaging);metallisation;metal-insulator boundaries","thermal transport properties;Au covered thin film SiO/sub 2/;thermal management;transient thermo-reflectance system;thin film thermal characteristics;intrinsic thermal conductivity;thermal interface resistances;interposed Cr film;interface effects;transient thermo-reflectance;thermally grown oxide;heat transfer model;100 to 1000 A;Au-Cr-SiO/sub 2/","","36","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

During the recognition process, the temporal characteristics of the test video sequence are analyzed over time by the HMM corresponding to each subject. The likelihood scores provided by the HMMs are compared, and the highest score provides the identity of the test video sequence. Furthermore, with unsupervised learning, each HMM is adapted with the test video sequence, which results in better modeling over time.

The controller consists of a PR (proportional-resonant) controller using the double sampling strategy, namely, a dual update scheme, a delayless feed-forward compensator, and a fast phase angle estimator. The PR controller is capable of regulating a sinusoidal line current without an additional prediction or an extremely high control gain under a medium switching frequency (0.5-5 kHz). The dual update scheme is the method that performs the sampling and control calculation twice in a switching period, which reduces the control time delay significantly and enables us to extend the maximum allowable control bandwidth. The proposed feed-forward compensator uses the estimated one-step predicted value of the source voltage and the source current to avoid adverse effects caused by the one-step delay, measurement noise, and harmonic component of the source voltage in the feedforward compensation process.

It is proven that under usual conditions satisfied by cost functions, a necessary condition for optimal reliability allocation of parallel-series systems is that the reliability of the redundant components of a given subsystem are identical. An optimal algorithm is proposed to solve this optimization problem. This paper proves that the components in each stage of a parallel-series system must have identical reliability, under some nonrestrictive condition on the component's reliability cost functions. This demonstration provides a firm grounding for what many authors have hitherto taken as a working hypothesis. Using this result, an algorithm, ECAY, is proposed for the design of systems with parallel-series architecture, which allows the allocation of both reliability and redundancy to each subsystem for a target reliability for minimizing the system cost. ECAY has the added advantage of allowing the optimal reliability allocation in a very short time. A benchmark is used to compare the ECAY performance to LM-based algorithms. For a given reliability target, ECAY produced the lowest reliability costs and the optimum redundancy levels in the successive reliability allocation for all cases studied, viz, systems of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 stages or subsystems. Thus ECAY, as compared with LM-based algorithms, yields a less costly reliability allocation within a reasonable computing time on large systems, and optimizes the weight and space-obstruction in system design throughout an optimal redundancy allocation.","1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2002.807242","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1179813","","Cost function;Redundancy;Optimization methods;Reliability;Constraint optimization;Minimization methods;Grounding;Algorithm design and analysis;Design optimization;Performance evaluation","reliability;costing;redundancy","cost minimization;redundancy;parallel-series systems;cost minimisation;cost functions;optimal reliability allocation;redundant components;identical reliability;nonrestrictive condition;ECAY algorithm;parallel-series architecture;reliability;system cost minimisation;space-obstruction;system design","","124","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Practically, we show that, using charge control, the maximum stable deflection is limited by 1) charge pull-in, in which the actuator snaps due to the presence of parasitic capacitance and 2) tip-in, in which the rotation mode becomes unstable. This work presents a circuit that controls the amount of charge on a parallel-plate, electrostatic actuator. This circuit reduces the sensitivity to parasitic capacitance, so that tip-in is the limiting instability. A small-signal model of the actuator is developed and used to determine the circuit bandwidth and gain requirements for stable deflections. Four different parallel-plate actuators have been designed and tested to verify the charge control technique as well as to verify charge pull-in, tip-in, and the bandwidth requirements. One design travels 83% of the gap before tip-in. Another design can only travel 20% of the gap before tip-in, regardless of whether voltage control or charge control is used.","1941-0158","","10.1109/JMEMS.2003.818455","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1240137","","Electrostatic actuators;Voltage control;Circuits;Position measurement;Parasitic capacitance;Bandwidth;Optical variables control;Electric variables control;Optical feedback;Electrodes","electric charge;capacitance;electric variables control;mechanical stability;rotation;electrostatic actuators;equivalent circuits;feedback;step response","charge control;parallel-plate actuators;electrostatic actuators;tip-in instability;stable operation;maximum stable deflection;charge pull-in;parasitic capacitance;rotation mode instability;small-signal model;small-signal equivalent circuit;bandwidth requirements;actuation voltage minimization","","154","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

RTP 2003","","2003","","","163","166","At sub-100 nm device nodes, the implementation of shallow trench isolation (STI) becomes more challenging due to shrinking geometries, increasing circuit density, and more stringent device leakage requirements. The manufacture of STI structures incorporates aspects of trench definition (lithography, etch), thermal oxidation, trench fill with deposited oxide, and CMP. The thermal oxidation step following trench etch is particularly important, as it can adversely impact transistor performance if not implemented successfully. The STI liner oxide is necessary to round the top and bottom trench corners for good transistor characteristics. With shrinking device geometries, these liner oxides are becoming thinner; therefore traditional methods for STI liner oxidation are proving ineffective. The In-Situ Steam Generation (ISSG) process addresses the limitations of other thermal oxidation methods through minimal consumption of the active area while effectively rounding the top and bottom trench corners of the STI structure and minimizing stress-induced defects. This paper discusses the benefits of ISSG for thermal oxidation in shallow trench isolation manufacture.","","0-7803-7874-1","10.1109/RTP.2003.1249142","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1249142","","Oxidation;Geometry;Etching;Thermal stresses;Silicon;Hydrogen;Transistors;Temperature;Atomic measurements;Circuits","isolation technology;oxidation;lithography;rapid thermal processing","shallow trench isolation;steam generation;shrinking geometry;circuit density;stringent device leakage;lithography;etching;thermal oxidation;impact transistor;oxidation;stress-induced defect;100 nm","","4","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In many cases, the mapping of features to the source code is poorly documented. In this paper, we present a semiautomatic technique that reconstructs the mapping for features that are triggered by the user and exhibit an observable behavior. The mapping is in general not injective; that is, a computational unit may contribute to several features. Our technique allows for the distinction between general and specific computational units with respect to a given set of features. For a set of features, it also identifies jointly and distinctly required computational units. The presented technique combines dynamic and static analyses to rapidly focus on the system's parts that relate to a specific set of features. Dynamic information is gathered based on a set of scenarios invoking the features. Rather than assuming a one-to-one correspondence between features and scenarios as in earlier work, we can now handle scenarios that invoke many features.

"A space-charge based method for the estimation of apparent mobility and trap depth as markers for insulation degradation-theoretical basis and experimental validation","G. Mazzanti; G. C.

Among these properties this paper focuses on the estimation of apparent trap-controlled mobility and trap distribution, based on the results of space charge measurements. The depolarization characteristic obtained recording space charge magnitude when, after poling, electric field is removed and electrodes are short-circuited and grounded, is the experimental reference for the application of the expressions for apparent trap-controlled mobility and trap depth calculation derived in this paper. A simple relationship is proposed for apparent mobility, which is affected by significant approximations, but can be applied successfully for material characterization and aging investigation. It is applied to experimental results coming from space charge measurements carried out by the pulsed electroacoustic (PEA) technique on cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) specimens, unaged and aged, cut from high-voltage cables. The trap depth distribution is calculated for the same material, and the results are cross-correlated with mobility estimates, revealing good agreement. Both apparent trap-controlled mobility and trap depth distribution reveal noticeable modifications with aging. The proposed methodology permits finding information on charge trapping/detrapping processes in polymeric materials, using a simple experimental procedure, as well as to extract quantities that seem very attractive as aging markers.","1558-4135","","10.1109/TDEI.2003.1194099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1194099","","Degradation;Aging;Space charge;Polymers;Current measurement;Charge measurement;Pulse measurements;Plastic insulation;Chemicals;Microstructure","power cable insulation;XLPE insulation;space charge;carrier mobility;electron traps;hole traps;ageing;charge measurement;acoustoelectric effects;polarisation;electrodes;short-circuit currents;insulation testing","space-charge based method;apparent mobility;trap depth;insulation degradation;polymeric insulation;irreversible chemical-physical modifications;effective ageing markers;material microstructure;apparent trap-controlled mobility;trap distribution;space charge measurements;depolarization characteristic;space charge magnitude;poling;electric field removal;short-circuited electrodes;grounded electrodes;material characterization;aging;pulsed electroacoustic technique;cross-linked polyethylene;XLPE;high-voltage cable insulation;mobility estimates","","153","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two different traction force controllers, adaptive fuzzy logic control and adaptive sliding-mode control, are proposed and applied to the fastest stable acceleration/deceleration and robust vehicle platooning problems. The motivation for investigating adaptive techniques arises from the unknown time-varying nature of the tire/road surface interaction that governs vehicle traction. Synchronous application of the engine or brake torques is also proposed for more stable vehicle maneuvers. The lack of controllability during braking (only one net input torque for the two control objectives, i.e., front and rear wheel slips) is partly overcome by applying auxiliary engine torque. Simulations of the two control methods are conducted using a complex nonlinear vehicle model which fully describes the dynamic behavior of the vehicle. Both controllers result in good performance under time-varying operating conditions.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2002.807677","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174058","","Programmable control;Adaptive control;Road vehicles;Force control;Intelligent vehicles;Road transportation;Sliding mode control;Robust control;Engines;Control systems","automated highways;traction;force control;adaptive control;control system synthesis;variable structure systems;robust control;torque;time-varying systems","adaptive vehicle traction force control;intelligent vehicle highway systems;robust longitudinal control;traction force controllers;adaptive fuzzy logic control;adaptive sliding-mode control;stable acceleration/deceleration;robust vehicle platooning;unknown time-varying nature;tire/road surface interaction;vehicle traction;brake torques;engine torques;controllability;rear wheel slip;front wheel slip;complex nonlinear vehicle model;dynamic behavior;controllers;time-varying operating conditions","","75","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Robustness against geometric distortion and JPEG compression at the same time with blind extraction remains especially challenging. A blind discrete wavelet transform-discrete Fourier transform (DWT-DFT) composite image watermarking algorithm that is robust against both affine transformation and JPEG compression is proposed. The algorithm improves robustness by using a new embedding strategy, watermark structure, 2D interleaving, and synchronization technique. A spread-spectrum-based informative watermark with a training sequence is embedded in the coefficients of the LL subband in the DWT domain while a template is embedded in the middle frequency components in the DFT domain. In watermark extraction, we first detect the template in a possibly corrupted watermarked image to obtain the parameters of an affine transform and convert the image back to its original shape. Then, we perform translation registration using the training sequence embedded in the DWT domain, and, finally, extract the informative watermark. Experimental work demonstrates that the proposed algorithm generates a more robust watermark than other reported watermarking algorithms. Specifically it is robust simultaneously against almost all affine transform related testing functions in StirMark 3.1 and JPEG compression with quality factor as low as 10. While the approach is presented for gray-level images, it can also be applied to color images and video sequences.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2003.815957","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1227607","","Discrete wavelet transforms;Watermarking;Robustness;Transform coding;Image coding;Discrete transforms;Fourier transforms;Interleaved codes;Frequency synchronization;Discrete Fourier transforms","watermarking;image coding;data compression;discrete wavelet transforms;discrete Fourier transforms;data encapsulation;transform coding","DWT-DFT composite watermarking scheme;image watermarking;affine transform;JPEG compression;geometric distortion;blind extraction;discrete wavelet transform;discrete Fourier transform;embedding strategy;watermark structure;2D interleaving;synchronization;translation registration;robust watermark;gray-level images;color images;video sequences","","182","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While PCA has been proven to be an optimal method for data compression, it is not necessarily an optimal method for feature extraction, particularly when the features are used in a supervised classifier. This paper addresses the issue of using PCA on hyperspectral data, specifically why PCA is not optimal for dimensionality reduction in target detection and classification applications.

This makes use of the quality factor enhancement in the resonator using a transformer and the deep switching-off technique by controlling gate bias. By turning off switching transistors of the differential VCO core deeply, the phase noise performance is improved more than 10 dB. The measured phase noise values are -110 and -117 dBc/HZ at the offset frequencies of 600 kHz and 1 MHz respectively. The tuning range of 250 MHz is achieved with the control voltage from 0 to 1 V. The VCO draws 8 mA in two differential core circuits from 3 V supply. When the bias voltage goes down to 2.5 V, the phase noise decrease only 2 dB compared to that of 3 V bias.

In particular, beamforming is the optimum signaling for all users when the interference is large. We propose several numerical approaches to decide the covariance matrices of the transmitted signals and compare their performance in terms of the system mutual information. We model the system as a noncooperative game and perform iterative water-filling to find the Nash equilibrium distributively. A centralized global approach and a distributed iterative approach based on the gradient projection method are also proposed.

The analysis and optimization of the LDPC component codes for the MLC and BICM schemes are complicated because, in general, the equivalent binary-input component channels are not necessarily symmetric. To overcome this obstacle, we deploy two different approaches: one based on independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) channel adapters and the other based on coset codes. By incorporating i.i.d. channel adapters, we can force the symmetry of each binary-input component channel. By considering coset codes, we extend the concentration theorem based on previous work by Richardson et al. ( see ibid., vol.47, p.599-618, Feb. 2001) and Kavc/spl caron/ic/spl acute/ et al.(see ibid., vol.49, p.1636-52, July 2003) We also discuss the relation between the systems based on the two approaches and show that they indeed have the same expected decoder behavior. Next, we jointly optimize the code rates and degree distribution pairs of the LDPC component codes for the MLC scheme. The optimized irregular LDPC codes at each level of MLC with multistage decoding (MSD) are able to perform well at signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) very close to the capacity of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. We also show that the optimized BICM scheme can approach the parallel independent decoding (PID) capacity as closely as does the MLC/PID scheme. Simulations with very large codeword length verify the accuracy of the analytical results. Finally, we compare the simulated performance of these coded modulation schemes at finite codeword lengths, and consider the results from the perspective of a random coding exponent analysis.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2003.815777","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1226601","","Modulation coding;Parity check codes;Decoding;AWGN;Signal to noise ratio;Analytical models;Interleaved codes;Independent component analysis;Additive white noise;Performance analysis","parity check codes;random codes;AWGN channels;channel capacity;interleaved codes;modulation coding;decoding","capacity-approaching bandwidth-efficient coded modulation;low-density parity-check codes;multilevel coding;bit-interleaved coded modulation;optimization;binary-input component channels;independent identically distributed channel adapters;i.d.d. channel adapters;coset codes;LDPC component codes;code rates;decoder;degree distribution pairs;optimized irregular LDPC codes;multistage decoding;signal-to-noise ratio;SNR;additive white Gaussian noise channel;AWGN channel capacity;parallel independent decoding;simulated performance;codeword length;random coding exponent analysis","","195","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the past, super-resolution techniques have been proposed to increase the resolution by combining information from multiple images. These techniques use super-resolution as a preprocessing step to obtain a high-resolution image that is later passed to a face recognition system. Considering that most state-of-the-art face recognition systems use an initial dimensionality reduction method, we propose to transfer the super-resolution reconstruction from pixel domain to a lower dimensional face space. Such an approach has the advantage of a significant decrease in the computational complexity of the super-resolution reconstruction. The reconstruction algorithm no longer tries to obtain a visually improved high-quality image, but instead constructs the information required by the recognition system directly in the low dimensional domain without any unnecessary overhead. In addition, we show that face-space super-resolution is more robust to registration errors and noise than pixel-domain super-resolution because of the addition of model-based constraints.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2003.811513","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1203152","","Face recognition;Image resolution;Image reconstruction;Surveillance;Computational complexity;Noise robustness;Cameras;Reconstruction algorithms;Image recognition","face recognition;image resolution;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;image reconstruction","eigenface-domain super-resolution;face recognition;surveillance cameras;reconstruction;visually improved high-quality image;low dimensional domain;face-space super-resolution;registration errors;noise","","168","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A conventional speed-based lead-lag PSS is used in this work. The multimachine power system operating at various loading conditions and system configurations is treated as a finite set of plants. The stabilizers are tuned to simultaneously shift the lightly damped and undamped electromechanical modes of all plants to a prescribed zone in the s-plane. A multiobjective problem is formulated to optimize a composite set of objective functions comprising the damping factor, and the damping ratio of the lightly damped electromechanical modes. The problem of robustly selecting the parameters of the power system stabilizers is converted to an optimization problem which is solved by a genetic algorithm with the eigenvalue-based multiobjective function. The effectiveness of the suggested technique in damping local and interarea modes of oscillations in multimachine power systems, over a wide range of loading conditions and system configurations, is confirmed through eigenvalue analysis and nonlinear simulation results.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2003.814848","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1216155","","Algorithm design and analysis;Robustness;Power systems;Genetic algorithms;Power system stability;Power system dynamics;Damping;Power system analysis computing;Power system simulation;Robust stability","genetic algorithms;damping;oscillations;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;power system dynamic stability","optimal multiobjective design;robust power system stabilizers;genetic algorithms;robust multimachine power system stabilizers;speed-based lead-lag PSS;multimachine power system;loading conditions;undamped electromechanical modes;lightly damped electromechanical modes;optimization;eigenvalue-based multiobjective function;interarea modes;local modes;eigenvalue analysis;dynamic stability;nonlinear simulation","","217","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, OFDM's performance suffers from the loss of multipath diversity, and the inability to guarantee symbol detectability when channel nulls occur. We introduce a linear constellation precoded OFDM for wireless transmissions over frequency-selective fading channels. Exploiting the correlation structure of subchannels and choosing system parameters properly, we first perform an optimal subcarrier grouping to divide the set of subchannels into subsets. Within each subset, a linear constellation-specific precoder is then designed to maximize both diversity and coding gains. While greatly reducing the decoding complexity and simplifying the precoder design, subcarrier grouping enables the maximum possible diversity and coding gains. In addition to reduced complexity, the proposed system guarantees symbol detectability regardless of channel nulls, and does not reduce the transmission rate. Analytic evaluation and corroborating simulations reveal its performance merits.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2003.809791","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1194447","","Frequency-selective fading channels;Decoding;Frequency division multiplexing;OFDM modulation;Peak to average power ratio;Code standards;Performance loss;Performance analysis;Analytical models;Propagation losses","OFDM modulation;modulation coding;diversity reception;multipath channels;fading channels;equalisers;correlation methods","linear constellation precoding;maximum multipath diversity;coding gain;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;parallel flat-fading subchannels;channel equalization;symbol decoding;multipath diversity;symbol detection;channel nulls;linear constellation precoded OFDM;wireless transmissions;frequency-selective fading channels;correlation structure;system parameters;optimal subcarrier grouping;linear constellation-specific precoder;diversity gain;reduced complexity;transmission rate;simulations","","247","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One promising powertrain concept is the continuously variable transmission (CVT), which offers a continuum of infinitely variable gear ratios between established minimum and maximum limits. This continuous gear ratio spectrum can increase the overall powertrain efficiency and eliminate the unwanted jerks associated with manual and automatic transmissions. Although basic CVT designs may have difficulty with high torque/low speed requirements, a power split continuously variable transmission configuration offers both fixed gearing and adjustable pulleys to satisfy driving demands. The effective control of the variable radius pulleys allows the designation of engine torque/speed to improve overall system performance for a given operating condition. In this paper, the fundamental components, configuration, and kinematics of a power split CVT will be briefly introduced. The problem of wheel speed (i.e., cruise) control of a CVT equipped vehicle will be considered. An innovative adaptive nonlinear controller will be designed to ensure asymptotic tracking of the desired wheel speed. Representative numerical results are presented and discussed to demonstrate the ability of the integrated CVT and engine controller in tracking the prescribed wheel speed.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2002.806434","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1173015","","Mechanical power transmission;Engines;Wheels;Automotive engineering;Vehicle safety;Gears;Pulleys;Power engineering and energy;Fuel economy;Torque","nonlinear control systems;automobile industry","nonlinear control;continuously variable transmission;automotive engineers;chassis technologies;vehicle performance;fuel economy;safety;powertrain concept;system performance;backstepping;operating condition;kinematics","","36","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The convergence of the regularized FOCUSS algorithm is established and it is shown that the stable fixed points of the algorithm are sparse. We investigate three different criteria for choosing the regularization parameter: quality of fit; sparsity criterion; L-curve. The L-curve method, as applied to the problem of subset selection, is found not to be robust, and we propose a novel modified L-curve procedure that solves this problem.

Discovering associations between items in a large database is one such data mining activity. In finding associations, support is used as an indicator as to whether an association is interesting. In this paper, we discuss three alternative interest measures for associations: any-confidence, all-confidence, and bond. We prove that the important downward closure property applies to both all-confidence and bond. We show that downward closure does not hold for any-confidence. We also prove that, if associations have a minimum all-confidence or minimum bond, then those associations will have a given lower bound on their minimum support and the rules produced from those associations will have a given lower bound on their minimum confidence as well. However, associations that have that minimum support (and likewise their rules that have minimum confidence) may not satisfy the minimum all-confidence or minimum bond constraint. We describe the algorithms that efficiently find all associations with a minimum all-confidence or minimum bond and present some experimental results.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2003.1161582","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1161582","","Bonding;Data mining;Itemsets;Association rules;Decision making;Transaction databases;Marketing and sales;Counting circuits;Information retrieval","data mining;database management systems","alternative interest measures;association mining;databases;data mining;associations;downward closure property;any-confidence interest measure;all-confidence interest measure;bond interest measure","","245","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The worsening process variation causes increased variability in performance, power, and reliability of VLSI circuits. Thus, performance and power consumption targets obtained during the design phase of VLSI circuits may significantly deviate from that of actual silicon resulting in significant yield losses. Adaptive body bias (ABB) has been shown to be an effective method of postsilicon tuning to reduce variability under the presence of process variation. Post silicon tuning can also be accomplished by using adaptive supply voltage (ASV).

"Multiple fundamental frequency estimation based on harmonicity and spectral smoothness","A. P. Klapuri","Inst. of Signal Process., Tampere Univ. of Technol., Finland","IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","","2003","11","6","804","816","A new method for estimating the fundamental frequencies of concurrent musical sounds is described. The method is based on an iterative approach, where the fundamental frequency of the most prominent sound is estimated, the sound is subtracted from the mixture, and the process is repeated for the residual signal. For the estimation stage, an algorithm is proposed which utilizes the frequency relationships of simultaneous spectral components, without assuming ideal harmonicity. For the subtraction stage, the spectral smoothness principle is proposed as an efficient new mechanism in estimating the spectral envelopes of detected sounds. With these techniques, multiple fundamental frequency estimation can be performed quite accurately in a single time frame, without the use of long-term temporal features. The experimental data comprised recorded samples of 30 musical instruments from four different sources. Multiple fundamental frequency estimation was performed for random sound source and pitch combinations. Error rates for mixtures ranging from one to six simultaneous sounds were 1.8%, 3.9%, 6.3%, 9.9%, 14%, and 18%, respectively. In musical interval and chord identification tasks, the algorithm outperformed the average of ten trained musicians. The method works robustly in noise, and is able to handle sounds that exhibit inharmonicities. The inharmonicity factor and spectral envelope of each sound is estimated along with the fundamental frequency.","1558-2353","","10.1109/TSA.2003.815516","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1255467","","Frequency estimation;Signal processing;Music;Signal processing algorithms;Instruments;Signal analysis;Multiple signal classification;Humans;Speech;Iterative methods","frequency estimation;spectral analysis;musical acoustics;iterative methods;acoustic signal processing;hearing","multiple fundamental frequency estimation;harmonicity;spectral smoothness;concurrent musical sounds;iterative approach;spectral components;random sound source;pitch combinations;musical interval;chord identification;acoustic signal analysis;pitch perceptions","","168","","50","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The second technique combines loss model and search approaches in a unique way to propose a hybrid method, where the first estimate is from the loss model approach and the subsequent adjustment of the flux is through the search technique. Both the algorithms are simple, easily realizable, and offer fast convergence. Also, smooth control of the flux offers excellent dynamic performance.

We then develop general closed-form weighted least-squares (WLS) and reweighted least-squares algorithms that compute the three-dimensional (3-D) location of a target whose bearing to a number of dispersed locations has been measured. We devise a scheme for adaptively choosing the weights for the WLS routine when measures of accuracy for the bearing estimates, such as the lower bound on the MSAE, are available. In addition, a measure of the potential estimation accuracy of a distributed system is developed based on a two-stage application of the Cramer-Rao bound.

As a step toward practical implementation of this technology in humans, we present an individualized method for selecting electroencephalogram (EEG) features and electrode locations for seizure prediction focused on precursors that occur within ten minutes of electrographic seizure onset. This method applies an intelligent genetic search process to EEG signals simultaneously collected from multiple intracranial electrode contacts and multiple quantitative features derived from these signals. The algorithm is trained on a series of baseline and preseizure records and then validated on other, previously unseen data using split sample validation techniques. The performance of this method is demonstrated on multiday recordings obtained from four patients implanted with intracranial electrodes during evaluation for epilepsy surgery. An average probability of prediction (or block sensitivity) of 62.5% was achieved in this group, with an average block false positive (FP) rate of 0.2775 FP predictions/h, corresponding to 90.47% specificity. These findings are presented as an example of a method for training, testing and validating a seizure prediction system on data from individual patients. Given the heterogeneity of epilepsy, it is likely that methods of this type will be required to configure intelligent devices for treating epilepsy to each individual's neurophysiology prior to clinical deployment.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2003.810706","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1198250","","Epilepsy;Electroencephalography;Electrodes;Signal processing;Laboratories;Humans;Genetics;Surgery;System testing;Neurophysiology","electroencephalography;diseases;medical signal detection;feature extraction;biomedical electrodes;genetic algorithms;neurophysiology;medical signal processing;prediction theory;brain models","epileptic seizure prediction;hybrid feature selection;multiple intracranial EEG electrode contacts;proof-of-principle experiments;clinical investigation;laboratory investigation;electroencephalogram features;electrode locations;precursors;electrographic seizure onset;intelligent genetic search process;multiple intracranial electrode contacts;multiple quantitative features;baseline records;preseizure records;split sample validation techniques;multiday recordings;four patients;intracranial electrodes;epilepsy surgery;average probability of prediction;block sensitivity;average block false positive rate;training;testing;epilepsy heterogeneity;neurophysiology;clinical deployment","Adult;Algorithms;Brain Mapping;Computer Simulation;Electrodes, Implanted;Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Epilepsy;Epilepsy;False Positive Reactions;Hippocampus;Humans;Middle Aged;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Quality Control;Reproducibility of Results;Seizures;Seizures;Seizures;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Temporal Lobe","167","","55","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since S-transform has better time frequency and localization property, power quality disturbances are detected and then classified in a superior way than the recently used wavelet transform.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2002.803824","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1193883","","Power quality;Data compression;Spline;Wavelet transforms;Transient analysis;Wavelet analysis;Signal resolution;Signal reconstruction;Monitoring;Time frequency analysis","power supply quality;power system faults;data compression;splines (mathematics);wavelet transforms","power quality disturbance data compression;power quality disturbance data detection;power quality disturbance data classification;integrated spline wavelet;S-transform;signal decomposition;wavelet transform coefficients thresholding","","81","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method integrates the information of face probabilities provided by the detector and the temporal information provided by the tracker to produce a method superior to the available detection and tracking methods. The three novel contributions of the paper are: 1) Accumulation of probabilities of detection over a sequence. This leads to coherent detection over time and, thus, improves detection results. 2) Prediction of the detection parameters which are position, scale, and pose. This guarantees the accuracy of accumulation as well as a continuous detection. 3) The representation of pose is based on the combination of two detectors, one for frontal views and one for profiles. Face detection is fully automatic and is based on the method developed by Schneiderman and Kanade (2000). It uses local histograms of wavelet coefficients represented with respect to a coordinate frame fixed to the object. A probability of detection is obtained for each image position and at several scales and poses. The probabilities of detection are propagated over time using a Condensation filter and factored sampling. Prediction is based on a zero order model for position, scale, and pose; update uses the probability maps produced by the detection routine. The proposed method can handle multiple faces, appearing/disappearing faces as well as changing scale and pose. Experiments carried out on a large number of sequences taken from commercial movies and the Web show a clear improvement over the results of frame-based detection (in which the detector is applied to each frame of the video sequence).","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2003.1233896","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1233896","","Face detection;Video sequences;Detectors;Phase detection;Filters;Predictive models;Motion pictures;Histograms;Wavelet coefficients;Image sampling","face recognition;image sequences","face probabilities;face detection;face tracking;video sequence;zero order model;condensation filter","","87","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The antenna consists of a pyramidal horn, a ridge, and a curved launching plane terminated with resistors. The pyramidal horn is connected to the outer conductor of the coaxial feed and serves as the ground plane. The curved launching plane is connected to the central conductor of the coaxial feed. Detailed three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations have been conducted to assist with the characterization of the antenna. FDTD results are compared with experimental data and are shown to be in good agreement. We demonstrate that the antenna exhibits a very low voltage standing wave ratio (/spl les/1.5) over a wide frequency range from 1 to 11 GHz and a very high fidelity (/spl ges/0.92). The spatial distribution of radiated energy is characterized both in the time domain, using transient field observations at various angles, as well as in the frequency domain, using single-frequency far-field radiation patterns.

Because channel state information (CSI) may be costly or impossible to acquire in rapidly varying wireless environments, we develop in this paper statistical water-filling approaches for stationary random fading channels. These approaches require only knowledge of the channel correlations that do not necessitate frequent updates, and can be easily acquired. Applied to a multiple transmit-antenna paradigm, our optimal transmitter design turns out to be an eigen-beamformer with multiple beams pointing to orthogonal directions along the eigenvectors of the channel's correlation matrix, and with proper power loading across the beams. The optimality pertains to minimizing a tight bound on the symbol error rate. The resulting loaded eigen-beamforming outperforms not only the equal-power allocation across all antennas, but also the conventional beamformer that transmits the available power along the strongest direction. Coupled with orthogonal space-time block codes, two-dimensional (2-D) eigen-beamforming emerges as a more attractive choice than conventional one-dimensional (1-D) beamforming with uniformly better performance, without rate reduction, and without complexity increase.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2003.813565","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1207368","","Transmitters;Block codes;Channel state information;Fading;Error analysis;Directive antennas;Loaded antennas;Transmitting antennas;Optical coupling;Two dimensional displays","optimisation;transmitting antennas;antenna arrays;array signal processing;block codes;space-time codes;correlation methods;matrix algebra;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;covariance analysis;diversity reception;fading channels","optimal transmitter eigen-beamforming;space-time block coding;channel correlations;optimal transmitter design;propagation channel;channel state information;varying wireless environments;stationary random fading channels;multiple transmit-antenna paradigm;multiple beams;eigenvectors;channel correlation matrix;symbol error rate;tight bound minimization;loaded eigen-beamforming;equal-power allocation;orthogonal space-time block codes;2D eigen-beamforming;two-dimensional eigen-beamforming;1D beamforming;statistical water-filling approaches;multiantenna diversity","","224","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Planning for a single demand profile can result in a large gap between planned capacity and actual capability when the realized product mix turns out differently from the one planned. This paper presents a method which accepts this uncertainty and uses stochastic integer programming to find a tool set robust to changes in demand. It considers a set of possible, discrete demand scenarios with associated probabilities, and determines the tools to purchase, under a budget constraint, to minimize weighted average unmet demand. The resulting robust tool set deals well with all the scenarios at no or minimal additional cost compared to that for a single demand profile. We also discuss the modifications of conventional business processes, needed to implement this method for dealing explicitly with uncertainty in demand.","1558-2345","","10.1109/TSM.2003.811894","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1198040","","Capacity planning;Uncertainty;Semiconductor device manufacture;Stochastic processes;Demand forecasting;Linear programming;Robustness;Discrete event simulation;Production;Throughput","integrated circuit manufacture;assembly planning;integer programming;stochastic programming;production control;uncertainty handling","semiconductor manufacturing;capacity planning;demand uncertainty;forecasted product demands;single demand profile;planned capacity;actual capability;stochastic integer programming;discrete demand scenarios;budget constraint;weighted average unmet demand;robust tool set","","88","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the convergence of the SART has never been established since then.

To overcome the periodization effect of a finite transform, we introduce a novel ordering of the FRAT coefficients. We also analyze the FRAT as a frame operator and derive the exact frame bounds. The resulting finite ridgelet transform (FRIT) is invertible, nonredundant and computed via fast algorithms. Furthermore, this construction leads to a family of directional and orthonormal bases for images. Numerical results show that the FRIT is more effective than the wavelet transform in approximating and denoising images with straight edges.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2002.806252","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1187351","","Image representation;Discrete transforms;Discrete wavelet transforms;Laboratories;Noise reduction;Image denoising;Image processing;Discrete cosine transforms;Wavelet domain;Continuous wavelet transforms","image representation;discrete transforms;Radon transforms;image denoising","image representation;digital images;sparse function expansion;continuous spaces;discrete images;finite-size images;finite Radon transform;FRAT coefficients ordering;frame operator;exact frame bounds;finite ridgelet transform;fast algorithms;invertible transform;wavelet transform;straight edges;images denoising;nonredundant transform","","447","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One difficulty in their use is the so-called near-far problem, where in close proximity to the ground transmitter, the pseudolite signal can be orders of magnitude stronger than the satellite signals. This large range of signal levels prevents a conventional receiver from simultaneously detecting both types of signals. This paper describes the application of a signal processing technique, known as successive interference cancellation (SIC), to the acquisition and tracking of weak satellite signals in the presence of a nearby pseudolite and possible multipath reflections of this pseudolite signal. The SIC architecture is implemented on simulated and experimental near-far data sets. The results are compared with a conventional detector and improvements in acquisition and tracking performance are illustrated.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2003.1207260","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1207260","","Interference cancellation;Global Positioning System;Satellites;Transmitters;Signal processing;Silicon carbide;Reflection;Detectors;Frequency conversion;Airports","Global Positioning System;interference (signal);multiuser detection;multipath channels","SIC multiuser detection scheme;multipath environment;GPS pseudolite near-far problems;successive interference cancellation;pseudolite ground-based transmitters;Global Positioning System;limited satellite visibility;ground transmitter close proximity;pseudolite/satellite signal magnitude;signal level range;receiver simultaneous signal detection;SIC signal processing techniques;weak satellite signal tracking;multipath reflections;near-far data sets","","49","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The readout of each spike is initiated by the individual pixel; therefore, the available output bandwidth is allocated according to pixel output demand. This encoding of light intensities favors brighter pixels, equalizes the number of integrated photons across light intensity, and minimizes power consumption. Tests conducted on the imager showed a large output dynamic range of 180 dB (under bright local illumination) for an individual pixel. The array, on the other hand, produced a dynamic range of 120 dB (under uniform bright illumination and when no lower bound was placed on the update rate per pixel). The dynamic range is 48.9 dB value at 30-pixel updates/s. Power consumption is 3.4 mW in uniform indoor light and a mean event rate of 200 kHz, which updates each pixel 41.6 times per second.

Highly linear frequency ramps make post measurement error correction feasible. Other important aspects of the high performance FMCW radar system are the design of the microwave circuit and the digital signal processing of the IF signals. Furthermore, a large RF bandwidth of more than 3 GHz obtained by thorough simulations results in a high range resolution and a good potential measurement accuracy.

We introduce two applications of an amplitude modulation-based watermarking method, in which we hide a user's biometric data in a variety of images. This method has the ability to increase the security of both the hidden biometric data (e.g., eigen-face coefficients) and host images (e.g., fingerprints).

First, we show that n can be expressed as function of the collision probability encountered on the channel; hence, it can be estimated based on run-time measurements. Second, we show that the estimation of n, based on exponential smoothing of the measured collision probability (specifically, an ARMA filter), results to be a biased estimation, with poor performance in terms of accuracy/tracking trade-offs. Third, we propose a methodology to estimate n, based on an extended Kalman filter coupled with a change detection mechanism. This approach shows both high accuracy as well as prompt reactivity to changes in the network occupancy status. Numerical results show that, although devised in the assumption of saturated terminals, our proposed approach results effective also in non-saturated conditions, and specifically in tracking the average number of competing terminals.","0743-166X","0-7803-7752-4","10.1109/INFCOM.2003.1208922","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1208922","","Intelligent networks;Throughput;Access protocols;Physical layer;Switches;Runtime;Smoothing methods;Filters;Collision avoidance;Multiaccess communication","autoregressive moving average processes;Kalman filters;wireless LAN","Kalman filter estimation;competing terminal estimation;IEEE 802.11 network;throughput performance;distributed coordination function;collision probability function;run-time measurement;exponential smoothing;ARMA filter;biased estimation;tracking trade-off;change detection mechanism;network occupancy status","","263","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Models explicitly represent the embedded software and the environment it operates in, and capture the requirements and the design of the application, simultaneously. Models are descriptive , in the sense that they allow the formal analysis, verification, and validation of the embedded system at design time. Models are also generative, in the sense that they carry enough information for automatically generating embedded systems using the techniques of program generators. Because of the widely varying nature of embedded systems, a single modeling language may not be suitable for all domains; thus, modeling languages are often domain-specific. To decrease the cost of defining and integrating domain-specific modeling languages and corresponding analysis and synthesis tools, the model-integrated approach is applied in a metamodeling architecture, where formal models of domain-specific modeling languages-called metamodels-play a key role in customizing and connecting components of tool chains. This paper discusses the principles and techniques of model-integrated embedded software development in detail, as well as the capabilities of the tools supporting the process. Examples in terms of real systems will be given that illustrate how the model-integrated approach addresses the physical nature, the assurance issues, and the dynamic structure of embedded software.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2002.805824","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1173205","","Embedded software;Embedded system;Embedded computing;Microwave integrated circuits;Design engineering;Timing;Automatic programming;Costs;Metamodeling","embedded systems;software engineering;formal verification","embedded software development;software engineering;design-space exploration;embedded systems;model verification;model-based development;model-integrated computing;modeling language;domain-specific modeling languages;formal analysis;formal verification;formal validation;software generators;system engineering","","218","","70","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To be more compact than the larger whegs vehicles, mini-whegs uses four whegs in an alternating diagonal gait.

Their robust construction allows them to tumble down a flight of stairs with no damage and carry a payload equal to twice their weight.

We introduce a new segmentation method combining some of their benefits. Our main intuition is that any cut on a graph embedded in some continuous space can be interpreted as a contour (in 2D) or a surface (in 3D). We show how to build a grid graph and set its edge weights so that the cost of cuts is arbitrarily close to the length (area) of the corresponding contours (surfaces) for any anisotropic Riemannian metric. There are two interesting consequences of this technical result. First, graph cut algorithms can be used to find globally minimum geodesic contours (minimal surfaces in 3D) under arbitrary Riemannian metric for a given set of boundary conditions. Second, we show how to minimize metrication artifacts in existing graph-cut based methods in vision. Theoretically speaking, our work provides an interesting link between several branches of mathematics -differential geometry, integral geometry, and combinatorial optimization.

The model is organized to facilitate the recognition of different IM3 components, especially those arising from out-of-band second-order distortion voltages. In addition, this transactions brief presents a technique for characterizing the nonlinearity coefficients of a RF power BJT and studies the behavior of intermodulation distortion as a function of bias point and of out-of-band impedance matching. Optimum bias and matching points are established for the test amplifier, and a good correlation is demonstrated between the calculated and measured data.

Most vision-based counting techniques depend on detecting individuals in order to count, an unrealistic proposition in crowded settings. We propose an alternative approach that directly estimates the number of people. In our system, groups of image sensors segment foreground objects from the background, aggregate the resulting silhouettes over a network, and compute a planar projection of the scene's visual hull. We introduce a geometric algorithm that calculates bounds on the number of persons in each region of the projection, after phantom regions have been eliminated. The computational requirements scale well with the number of sensors and the number of people, and only limited amounts of data are transmitted over the network. Because of these properties, our system runs in real-time and can be deployed as an untethered wireless sensor network.

The longer OFDM symbol duration provides an advantage in a presence of weak impulsive noise, because impulsive noise energy is spread among simultaneously transmitted OFDM sub-carriers. However, it has been recently recognized that this advantage turns into a disadvantage if the impulsive noise energy exceeds certain threshold. In this paper the algorithm for impulsive noise suppression in OFDM receivers is proposed and investigated. Whereas traditional methods for impulsive noise suppression are implemented in a time domain before OFDM demodulation, proposed algorithm compensates impulsive noise in a frequency domain after OFDM demodulation and channel equalization. The method is applied to DVB-T and its performance is studied by means of simulation.","1558-4127","","10.1109/TCE.2003.1261179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1261179","","Digital video broadcasting;Gaussian noise;Additive white noise;Signal processing algorithms;Demodulation;OFDM modulation;Interference;Iterative algorithms;AWGN;Digital audio broadcasting","interference suppression;OFDM modulation;digital video broadcasting;impulse noise;television receivers;television interference","impulsive noise suppression;OFDM-based communication systems;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;terrestrial digital video broadcasting;weak impulsive noise;frequency domain;channel equalization","","125","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the high and low signal-to-background ratio regimes, we show that the ergodic capacity of this fading channel equals or exceeds that for a channel with deterministic path gains. Furthermore, knowledge of these path gains is not necessary to achieve capacity when the signal-to-background ratio is high. In the low signal-to-background ratio regime, path-gain knowledge provides minimal capacity improvement when using a moderate number of transmit apertures. We also develop expressions for the capacity-versus-outage probability in the high and low signal-to-background ratio regimes, by means of a moment-matching approximation to the distribution for the sum of lognormal random variables.

Specifically, the control law of an agent depends on the state of a set of agents that are within a certain neighborhood around it. As the agents move around this set changes, giving rise to a dynamic control interconnection topology and a switching control law. This control law consists of a combination of attractive/repulsive and alignment forces. The former ensure collision avoidance and cohesion of the group and the latter result to all agents attaining a common heading angle, exhibiting flocking motion. Despite the use of only local information and the time varying nature of agent interaction which affects the local controllers, flocking motion is established, as long as connectivity in the neighboring graph is maintained.","0191-2216","0-7803-7924-1","10.1109/CDC.2003.1272911","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1272911","","Mobile agents;Topology;Stability analysis;Vehicle dynamics;Animals;Mechanical engineering;Mechanical factors;Force control;Motion control;Autonomous agents","mobile robots;graph theory;stability;decentralised control;collision avoidance;multi-robot systems;motion control","stable flocking;multiple mobile agents;double integrator dynamics;dynamic control interconnection topology;switching control law;collision avoidance;flocking motion","","34","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, the performance and complexity tradeoffs between these algorithms have not been well explored. To address this problem, we have built an FPGA implementation of a synchronization system using both autocorrelation and cross-correlation.

In the first stage, the images that are dissimilar with the query image are first filtered out by using eccentricity to reduce the search space, and fine retrieval follows by using all three sets of features in the reduced search space in the second stage. Different from eccentricity and ACH, the CCD curve is neither scaling-invariant nor rotation-invariant. Therefore, normalisation is required for the CCD curve to achieve scaling invariance, and starting point location is required to achieve rotation invariance with the similarity measure of CCD curves. A thinning-based method is proposed to locate starting points of leaf image contours, so that the approach used is more computationally efficient. Actually, the method can benefit other shape representations that are sensitive to starting points by reducing the matching time in image recognition and retrieval. Experimental results on 1400 leaf images from 140 plants show that the proposed approach can achieve a better retrieval performance than both the curvature scale space (CSS) method and the modified Fourier descriptor (MFD) method. In addition, the two-stage approach can achieve a performance comparable to an exhaustive search, but with a much reduced computational complexity.","1350-245X","","10.1049/ip-vis:20030160","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1192289","","","image retrieval;edge detection;image matching;image thinning","shape based leaf image retrieval;two-stage approach;shape features;centroid-contour distance curve;CCD curve;eccentricity;angle code histogram;ACH;query image;search space;normalisation;scaling invariance;starting point location;thinning-based method;shape representations;matching time;image recognition;leaf images;plants;curvature scale space method;CSS method;modified Fourier descriptor method;MFD method;computational complexity","","52","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals"

Modulation of the input capacitance, a technique used in macroscale instruments such as the vibrating-reed electrometer and the field-mill electrostatic voltmeter (ESV), moves the detection bandwidth away from the 1/f-noise-limited regime, thus improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The variable capacitors are implemented by electrostatically driven resonators with differential actuation and sensing to reduce drive-signal feedthrough. The resonators in the electrometer utilize a balanced comb structure to implement harmonic sensing. Two fabrication methods were employed - a hybrid technology utilizing fluidically self-assembled JFETs and SOI microstructures, and an integrated process from Analog Devices combining 0.8-μm CMOS and 6-μm-thick polysilicon microstructures. All devices operate in ambient air at room temperature. Measured data from one electrometer with an input capacitance of 0.7 pF indicates a charge resolution of 4.5 aC rms (28 electrons) in a 0.3 Hz bandwidth. The resolution of this electrometer is unequaled by any known ambient-air-operated instrument over a wide range of source capacitances. The EFM has a resolution of 630 V/m, the best reported figure for a MEMS device.","1941-0158","","10.1109/JMEMS.2003.818066","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1240129","","Electrostatics;Micromechanical devices;Capacitance;Capacitors;Instruments;Bandwidth;Microstructure;Voltmeters;Signal to noise ratio;Fabrication","electrometers;microsensors;capacitors;voltmeters;electrostatic devices;micromechanical resonators","electrostatic charge sensor;electrostatic field sensor;micromechanical resonator;electrometer;hybrid technology;fluidic self-assembly;JFET;SOI microstructure;CMOS integrated process;polysilicon microstructure;electrostatic voltmeter;electrostatic fieldmeter;MEMS variable capacitor;signal-to-noise ratio;comb structure;harmonic sensing;0.8 micron;0.3 Hz;0.7 pF;Si","","103","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The traceability infrastructure underlying a software system tends to erode over its lifetime, as time-pressured practitioners fail to consistently maintain links and update impacted artifacts each time a change occurs, even with the support of automated systems. This paper proposes a new method of traceability based upon event-notification and is applicable even in a heterogeneous and globally distributed development environment. Traceable artifacts are no longer tightly coupled but are linked through an event service, which creates an environment in which change is handled more efficiently, and artifacts and their related links are maintained in a restorable state. The method also supports enhanced project management for the process of updating and maintaining the system artifacts.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2003.1232285","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232285","","Software maintenance;Software systems;Maintenance engineering;Control systems;Computer science;Computer Society;Project management;Software testing;System testing;Software engineering","software maintenance;systems analysis;bibliographies","requirements traceability;traceability scheme;traceability infrastructure;impacted artifacts;event-notification;heterogeneous globally distributed development environment;evolutionary change;software maintenance","","146","","69","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, no physical parameters can be derived exactly. In addition, when the robot picks up objects of uncertain lengths, orientations, or gripping points, the overall kinematics from the robot's base to the tip of the object becomes uncertain and changes according to different tasks. Consequently, it is unknown whether stability of the robot could be guaranteed in the presence of uncertain kinematics. In order to overcome these drawbacks, in this paper, we propose simple feedback control laws for setpoint control without exact knowledge of kinematics, Jacobian matrix, and dynamics. Lyapunov functions are presented for stability analysis of feedback control problem with uncertain kinematics. We shall show that the end-effector's position converges to a desired position in a finite task space even when the kinematics and Jacobian matrix are uncertain.

There are some product metrics for measuring the reusability of object-oriented software. However, in application development with reuse, it is difficult to use conventional metrics because the source codes of components cannot be obtained, and these metrics require analysis of source codes. We propose a metrics suite for measuring the reusability of such black-box components based on limited information that can be obtained from the outside of components without any source codes. We define five metrics for measuring a component's understandability, adaptability, and portability, with confidence intervals that were set by statistical analysis of a number of JavaBeans components. Moreover, we provide a reusability metric by combining these metrics based on a reusability model. As a result of evaluation experiments, it is found that our metrics can effectively identify black-box components with high reusability.","1530-1435","0-7695-1987-3","10.1109/METRIC.2003.1232469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232469","","Software measurement;Software reusability;Programming;Software metrics;Logic;Object oriented modeling;Software systems;Computer science;Computer industry;Cities and towns","software metrics;software portability;distributed object management;software performance evaluation;software reusability;object-oriented programming;software quality;statistical analysis;Java","software metrics;software reusability measurement;component-based software development;object-oriented software;black-box component;statistical analysis;JavaBeans component;software evaluation","","61","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are various reverberation chamber techniques found in the literature and international standards. These techniques can give incorrect results because aperture and cavity-size effects are not correctly accounted for. In fact, we show that for no sample in the aperture, these techniques give a nonzero result for shielding effectiveness. In this paper, we review existing techniques and present a new technique for determining the shielding effectiveness of materials from nested reverberation-chamber measurements.

Using the measured frequencies, estimates of the decoder time complexity for various hardware platforms can be determined. A detailed example is provided to assist in deriving time complexity estimates. We compare the resulting estimates to numbers measured for an optimized decoder on the Pentium 3 hardware platform.

The first half of the paper deals with constructions using field extensions of /spl Qopf/. Working with cyclotomic field extensions, we construct several families of STBCs over a wide range of signal sets that are of full rank, minimal delay, and rate at least one appropriate for any number of transmit antennas. We study the coding gain and capacity of these codes. Using transcendental extensions we construct arbitrary rate codes that are full rank for arbitrary number of antennas. We also present a method of constructing STBCs using noncyclotomic field extensions. In the later half of the paper, we discuss two ways of embedding noncommutative division algebras into matrices: left regular representation, and representation over maximal cyclic subfields. The 4/spl times/4 real orthogonal design is obtained by the left regular representation of quaternions. Alamouti's (1998) code is just a special case of the construction using representation over maximal cyclic subfields and we observe certain algebraic uniqueness characteristics of it. Also, we discuss a general principle for constructing cyclic division algebras using the nth root of a transcendental element and study the capacity of the STBCs obtained from this construction.

The proposed destruction mode has significant similarities with previously described second breakdown at the static breakdown voltage. An approximate analytical model which was derived indicates that avalanche at the n-n/sup +/ junction should become unstable with a time constant on the order of nanoseconds, whereas dynamic avalanche at the p-n junction should be stable. Simulations and measurements show that the reverse recovery safe operating area depends on the n-base width.

It is therefore deemed that the use of on-chip error correction codes (ECCs) will gain widespread acceptance in large-capacity flash memories. ECCs for flash memories must have very fast and compact encoding/decoding circuitry so as to have a minimum impact on memory access time. The area penalty due to check cells must also be minimized. Moreover, specific codes must be developed for ML storage. This paper presents error control coding techniques and schemes for new-generation flash memories, focusing on ML devices. The basic concepts of error control coding are reviewed, and the on-chip ECC design procedure is analyzed. Dedicated codes such as polyvalent ECCs, able to correct data stored in ML memories working at a variable number of bits per cell, and bit-layer organized ECCs are described.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2003.811709","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1199087","","Error correction;Flash memory;Error correction codes;Redundancy;Hip;Alpha particles;Fabrication;Encoding;Decoding;Circuits","flash memories;error correction codes;integrated circuit reliability;error statistics;decoding","on-chip error correcting techniques;new-generation flash memories;disturbs;data retention;cell size;oxide thickness;device reliability;multilevel flash memories;adjacent programmed levels;large-capacity flash memories;encoding/decoding circuitry;memory access time;area penalty;check cells;error control coding techniques;polyvalent ECCs;bit-layer organized ECCs;reliability improvement","","91","","56","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using this amplifier, a two-element active Van Atta retrodirective array is implemented and compared to a four-element passive array. The bi-directional amplifier is constructed by two identical one-port reflection-type amplifiers and a 3-dB 90/spl deg/ hybrid. The reflection-type amplifier is designed using an FET with a single-power-supply configuration. A quarter-wavelength microstrip radial stub is connected to the device's source terminal to narrow down the negative-resistance frequency range so as to avoid oscillation at undesired frequencies. The fabricated bi-directional amplifier provides the transmission gain over the frequency band from 5.76 to 6.88 GHz, with a peak value of 9.1 dB at 6.04 GHz. Printed Yagi antennas with four directors are adopted to build both the active and passive Van Atta arrays. The 3-dB back-scattering beamwidth of the active array is measured as wide as 74/spl deg/. Finally, it is observed from the measurements that, although only half of the antenna elements are used, the active Van Atta array produces a back-scattering field level 4.5 dB, on average, higher than the passive one does. This verifies the performance of the bi-directional amplifier.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2002.807814","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1179425","","Bidirectional control;Phased arrays;Frequency;Antenna arrays;Receiving antennas;Radiofrequency amplifiers;RF signals;Directive antennas;Transmission line antennas;Yagi-Uda antennas","Yagi antenna arrays;microwave amplifiers;microstrip antenna arrays;electromagnetic wave reflection;electromagnetic wave transmission;negative resistance;field effect transistor circuits;antenna testing;electromagnetic wave scattering;backscatter","two-port bi-directional amplifier;four-element passive array;identical one-port reflection-type amplifiers;hybrid amplifier;single-power-supply configuration;FET reflection-type amplifier design;quarter-wavelength microstrip radial stub;source terminal;negative-resistance frequency range;oscillation frequencies;bi-directional amplifier transmission gain;frequency band;two-element active Van Atta retrodirective array;printed Yagi antennas;antenna directors;back-scattering beamwidth;passive Van Atta arrays;antenna measurements;back-scattering field level;reflection-type amplifier;antenna elements;5.76 to 6.88 GHz;9.1 dB;6.04 GHz","","60","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present the first volumetric images obtained using a 2-D CMUT array. We have fabricated a 128/spl times/128-element 2-D CMUT array with through-wafer via interconnects and a 420-/spl mu/m element pitch. As an experimental prototype, a 32/spl times/64-element portion of the 128/spl times/128-element array was diced and flip-chip bonded onto a glass fanout chip. This chip provides individual leads from a central 16/spl times/16-element portion of the array to surrounding bondpads. An 8/spl times/16-element portion of the array was used in the experiments along with a 128-channel data acquisition system. For imaging phantoms, we used a 2.37-mm diameter steel sphere located 10 mm from the array center and two 12-mm-thick Plexiglas plates located 20 mm and 60 mm from the array. A 4/spl times/4 group of elements in the middle of the 8/spl times/16-element array was used in transmit, and the remaining elements were used to receive the echo signals. The echo signal obtained from the spherical target presented a frequency spectrum centered at 4.37 MHz with a 100% fractional bandwidth, whereas the frequency spectrum for the echo signal from the parallel plate phantom was centered at 3.44 MHz with a 91% fractional bandwidth. The images were reconstructed by using RF beamforming and synthetic phased array approaches and visualized by surface rendering and multiplanar slicing techniques. The image of the spherical target has been used to approximate the point spread function of the system and is compared with theoretical expectations. This study experimentally demonstrates that 2-D CMUT arrays can be fabricated with high yield using silicon IC-fabrication processes, individual electrical connections can be provided using through-wafer vias, and flip-chip bonding can be used to integrate these dense 2-D arrays with electronic circuits for practical 3-D imaging applications.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2003.1251142","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1251142","","Ultrasonic imaging;Ultrasonic transducer arrays;Bonding;Imaging phantoms;Frequency;Bandwidth;Phased arrays;Ultrasonic transducers;Integrated circuit interconnections;Prototypes","ultrasonic imaging;ultrasonic transducer arrays;micromachining;phantoms;wafer bonding","volumetric ultrasound imaging;capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers;real time 3-D imaging;volumetric images;interconnects;experimental prototype;flip chip bonding;glass fanout chip;128-channel data acquisition system;imaging phantoms;steel sphere;Plexiglas plates;frequency spectrum;echo signal;parallel plate phantom;fractional bandwidth;image reconstruction;RF beamforming;synthetic phased array;surface rendering;multiplanar slicing techniques;spherical target;point spread function;silicon IC-fabrication processes;electrical connections;dense 2-D arrays;electronic circuits;practical 3-D imaging applications;2.37 mm;12 mm;20 mm;60 mm;4.37 MHz;3.44 MHz","Algorithms;Equipment Failure Analysis;Image Enhancement;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Nucleocapsid Proteins;Phantoms, Imaging;Transducers;Ultrasonography;Ultrasonography","120","","46","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such devices are said to be inept in a precise technical sense that can be easily tested from an explicit mathematical criteria to be presented in this two-part tutorial review. Often an inept device can be redesigned into a smart device capable of computing and artificial intelligence by massaging the device's parameters, such as doping, concentration, geometrical profile, chemical moiety, etc., in accordance with the principle of local activity to be articulated in Part II. In particular, designing a smart nanodevice amounts to fine tuning the device parameters into a much smaller niche within the device's locally active parameter region called the edge of chaos where complexity abounds. Molecular and nanodevices will remain novelty toys for nanodevice specialists unless they possess realistic nonlinear circuit models so that future nano circuit designers can simulate their exotic designs as easily and accurately as current CMOS circuit designers. A mathematically consistent theory for modeling nonlinear, high-frequency nanodevices, specially those which exploited exotic tunneling and entanglement quantum mechanical effects, such as Coulomb blockade, quasi-particle dynamics, Kondo resonance, Aharonov-Bohm nonlocal interactions, etc., will require the introduction of a complete family of fundamental circuit elements as model building blocks. They are presented via a doubly periodic table of circuit elements somewhat reminiscent of Mendeleev's periodic table of chemical elements. These fundamental circuit elements can be compactly represented by a loop of four generic species of circuit elements wrapped around the surface of a torus where any higher order element having an arbitrarily high order of frequency dependence can be generated from one of them, modulo the integer 4, ad infinitum. The significance of this four-element torus is that realistic circuit models of all current and future molecular and nanodevices must necessarily build upon an appropriate subset of nonlinear circuit elements begotten from this torus.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2003.818319","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1240074","","Nonlinear circuits;Chemical elements;Semiconductor device modeling;Mathematical model;Information technology;Circuit testing;Artificial intelligence;Doping profiles;Local activities;Nanoscale devices","nonlinear network synthesis;nanoelectronics;molecular electronics;reviews;quantum interference devices","nanodevices;molecular electronics;four-element torus;tutorial review;inept device;smart nanodevice;fine tuning;locally active parameter region;edge of chaos;nonlinear circuit models;mathematically consistent theory;nonlinear high-frequency nanodevices;exotic tunneling;entanglement quantum mechanical effects;Coulomb blockade;quasi-particle dynamics;Kondo resonance;Aharonov-Bohm nonlocal interactions;doubly periodic table of circuit elements","","168","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On the contrary, annealing of SiO/sub 2/ capacitors in oxygen-enriched N/sub 2/ atmosphere increased the work function. A variation in EOT of less than 2 A was demonstrated for the various annealing temperatures, concluding that the ALD TiN is stable in contact with the different dielectric materials.

Two of the more difficult aspects of applying IEEE Std 519 are (j) determining an appropriate point of common coupling (PCC) and (ii) establishing a demand current at the design stage. This is because the standard does not provide a concise definition of the PCC and the recommended definition of demand current is a value that can only be determined by measurements taken after installation. This paper represents the authors'-best interpretation of IEEE Std 519.

A careful observability study reveals interesting group theoretic structures tied to the underlying system structure. A locally convergent observer where the states evolve on SO (3) is proposed and numerical estimates of the domain of attraction is given. Further, it is shown that, given convergent orientation estimates, position estimation can be formulated as a linear implicit output problem.

The objective of this study was to explore whether project management constructs could be used to distinguish between projects that escalated and those that did not. Based on a survey administered to IS audit and control professionals, data were gathered on projects that did not escalate as well as those that did escalate. We then applied logistic regression to model the relationship between various project management constructs and project escalation. The model was then evaluated for its ability to correctly classify the projects. The results of our research suggest that a logistic regression model based on project management constructs is capable of discriminating between projects that escalate and those that do not.

For many of the failure mechanisms in electronic products, there are models that relate environmental loads to the time to failure of the product. Thus, by monitoring the environment of a product over its life cycle, it may be possible to determine the amount of damage induced by various loads and predict when the product might fail. This paper describes the development of a physics-of-failure-based methodology for determining the damage or life consumption in a product. As a demonstration of the methodology, a data recorder has been used to monitor the temperature and vibration loads on a printed circuit board placed under the hood of a car. The data collected by the recorder has been used to determine the life consumption in the solder joints of the printed circuit board due to temperature and vibration loading. The calculated remaining life has then been compared with temperature cycling test results on the board to assess the validity of the approach.","1557-9972","","10.1109/TCAPT.2003.817654","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1234921","","Condition monitoring;Engines;Electrochemical machining;Printed circuits;Petroleum;Temperature sensors;Degradation;Humidity;Failure analysis;Temperature measurement","life cycle costing;environmental factors;failure analysis;soldering;printed circuit testing;life testing","life consumption monitoring methodology;electronic systems;environmental loads;temperature;humidity;vibration;radiation;failure mechanisms;life cycle;physics-of-failure-based methodology;data recorder;printed circuit board;solder joints;temperature cycling","","98","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The results obtained are presented and a new perspective to the power management of distribution systems is discussed.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2002.807044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1178761","","Distributed control;Distributed power generation;Power system modeling;Power generation;Investments;Military computing;Sampling methods;History;Energy management;Power system management","distributed power generation;power distribution reliability;power generation reliability;power system security;Monte Carlo methods","distributed generation systems adequacy assessment;Monte Carlo simulation;state duration sampling approach;power capacity;case study;distribution systems power management","","116","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper we have rigorously proved that UC is indeed an NP complete problem, and therefore it is impossible to develop an algorithm with polynomial computation time to solve it. In comparison with the general MIP methods, the LR methodology is more scaleable and efficient to obtain near optimal schedules for large scale and hard UC problems at the cost of a small percentage of deviation from the optimal solution.

The model is multiperiod and nonlinear in nature and utilizes a Newton based algorithm for minimizing the total operating cost. Optimal operating strategies for different equipment combinations for a typical industrial configuration under different electricity tariff rates are determined using the proposed model. The results show that industrial cogeneration has a significant potential in reducing peak coincident demand. The optimal response of cogeneration plant reduces the peak coincident demand by 42.8 MW (71%) under flat tariff and 54 MW (90%) under TOU tariff.

However, the monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC)-based phased array antennas also present challenges to mission designers because of reduced power efficiency, higher costs, and system effects that result in link degradations. The NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) continues to pioneer aerospace communications technologies to address the challenges of array antennas to improve efficiency, reduce costs [Romanofsky, R., et al., December 2000], and better understand system effects [R. Acosta, et al., May 2002 and S. Johnson et al., June 2002]. This paper addresses the degenerative system effects between high-rate modulated data and signal timing delays caused by antenna beam steering at wide scan angles. Conventional phase shifters used in MMIC-based phased array antennas are physically limited to 360/spl deg/ of phase shift. Often, depending on the size of the array and/or specified beam angle, the required phase shift of some elements may exceed 360/spl deg/. In these instances, the actual phase shift obtained is the remainder of the phase request, modulo 2/spl pi/. The modulo 2/spl pi/ result causes a delayed carrier signal radiated from the element whose phase shifter requires a phase shift greater than 360/spl deg/. Multiple delayed signals radiates from the antenna depending on the size of the array and scan angle. The array antenna system performance described in this report is characterized by measuring the bit error rate (BER) of the link from modulator to demodulator through the phased array antenna across a link inside an anechoic chamber. The array antenna introduces intersymbol interference (ISI) into the link due to the modulo 2/spl pi/ effect of the phase shifters. The ISI is observable in the BER versus Eb/No curve as a ""flaring"" or additional insertion loss at high Eb/No. Theoretical calculations and computer simulations indicate as much as 3-4 dB degradation due to ISI when the data rate is an appreciable fraction of carrier frequency (>2 Gbps at K- band). Data rates more characteristic of near term systems (e.g. < 1 Gbps) result in somewhat lower losses. Results presented here were obtained for 220 Mbps and 622 Mbps through a K-band (20 GHz), 91-element, phased array antenna. Discussion is provided where results agree and disagree with the simulation results for the data rate and carrier frequency used.","","0-7803-7827-X","10.1109/PAST.2003.1257023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1257023","","Phased arrays;Antenna arrays;Degradation;Intersymbol interference;Phase shifters;Bit error rate;NASA;Beam steering;Microwave antenna arrays;Costs","error statistics;beam steering;phase shifters;antenna phased arrays;intersymbol interference;MMIC;microwave antenna arrays","phased array antenna-based system degradation;wide scan angles;National Aeronautics and Space Administration;vibration free beam steering;multibeam capability;monolithic microwave integrated circuit;NASA Glenn Research Center;aerospace communications technologies;degenerative system;high-rate modulated data;signal timing delays;antenna beam steering;phase shifters;bit error rate;BER;array antenna introduces intersymbol interference;anechoic chamber;modulo 2/spl pi/;carrier frequency;220 Mbit/s;622 Mbit/s;3 to 4 dB;20 GHz","","5","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The algorithm detects valid segments at each scale using three criteria namely growing, merging and saturation. Segments extracted at various scales are integrated in the final result. The algorithm is composed of two passes preceded by a preprocessing step for simplifying small scale details of the image that might cause over-segmentation. In the first pass feature images at various scales are extracted and kept in respective level of morphological towers. In the second pass, potential features contributing to the formation of segments at various scales are detected. Finally the algorithm traces the contours of all such contributing features at various scales.

Non-CRF inhibition is exhibited by 80% of the orientation-selective neurons in the primary visual cortex of monkeys and has been shown to influence human visual perception as well. Essentially, the response of an edge detector at a certain point is suppressed by the responses of the operator in the region outside the supported area. We combine classical edge detection with isotropic and anisotropic inhibition, both of which have counterparts in biology. We also use a biologically motivated method (the Gabor energy operator) for edge detection. The resulting operator responds strongly to isolated lines, edges, and contours, but exhibits weak or no response to edges that are part of texture. We use natural images with associated ground truth contour maps to assess the performance of the proposed operator for detecting contours while suppressing texture edges. Our method enhances contour detection in cluttered visual scenes more effectively than classical edge detectors used in machine vision (Canny edge detector). Therefore, the proposed operator is more useful for contour-based object recognition tasks, such as shape comparison, than traditional edge detectors, which do not distinguish between contour and texture edges. Traditional edge detection algorithms can, however, also be extended with surround suppression. This study contributes also to the understanding of inhibitory mechanisms in biology.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2003.814250","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1212647","","Image edge detection;Detectors;Machine vision;Neurons;Humans;Visual perception;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Layout;Object recognition;Shape","image texture;edge detection;computer vision;visual perception;clutter;object recognition","contour detection;nonclassical receptive field inhibition;biologically motivated method;surround inhibition;surround suppression;machine vision;orientation-selective neurons;primary visual cortex;monkeys;human visual perception;isotropic inhibition;anisotropic inhibition;Gabor energy operator;edge detection;image texture;natural images;ground truth contour maps;cluttered visual scenes;Canny edge detector;object recognition tasks","","238","","98","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This restructuring allows digital control to be integrated into first courses, thereby teaching students what they need to learn, making these courses appealing, and providing a seamless continuity to advanced courses. By a concise presentation in just two undergraduate courses, this restructuring motivates students to take related courses in programmable logic controllers, microcontrollers and digital signal processor applications. This ensures a first-rate education that is meaningful in the workplace as well as in graduate education leading to a research and development oriented career. This restructuring has several components to it. Outdated topics that waste time and mislead students are deleted. To integrate control in the first courses, unique approaches are developed to convey information more effectively. In the first course in power electronics, a building block is identified in commonly used power converter topologies in order to unify their analysis. In the field of electric drives, the use of space vectors is introduced on a physical basis to describe operation of ac machines in steady state in the first course, and to discuss their optimum control under dynamic conditions in the advanced course. Appropriate simulation software and software-reconfigurable hardware laboratories using a DSP-based rapid prototyping tool are used to support the analytical discussion.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2002.807120","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1187462","","Power electronics;Digital control;Educational programs;Electric machines;Education;Programmable control;Microcontrollers;Digital signal processors;Employment;Research and development","power electronics;motor drives;machine control;digital control;electronic engineering education;power engineering education;control engineering education","first courses restructuring;power electronics course restructuring;electric drives;digital control;University of Minnesota;electric machines/drives course restructuring;undergraduate courses;programmable logic controllers;microcontrollers;digital signal processor;first-rate education;graduate education;research and development oriented career;power converter topologies;space vectors;AC machines;steady state;optimum control;dynamic conditions;simulation software;software-reconfigurable hardware laboratories;DSP-based rapid prototyping","","73","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Backstepping control of linear time-varying systems with known and unknown parameters","Youping Zhang; B. Fidan; P. A. Ioannou","Synopsys, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","","2003","48","11","1908","1925","The backstepping control design procedure has been used to develop stabilizing controllers for time invariant plants that are linear or belong to some class of nonlinear systems. The use of such a procedure to design stabilizing controllers for plants with time varying parameters has been an open problem. In this paper we consider the backstepping design procedure for linear time varying (LTV) plants with known and unknown parameters. We first show that a backstepping controller can be designed for an LTV plant by following the same steps as in the linear time-invariant (LTI) case and treating the plant parameters as constants at each time t. Its stability properties however cannot be established by using the same Lyapunov function and techniques as in the LTI case. We then introduce a new parametrization and filter structure that takes into account the plant parameter variations leading to a new backstepping controller. The new control design guarantees exponential convergence of the tracking error to zero if the plant parameters are exactly known. If the parameters are not precisely known but the time variations of the parameters associated with the system zeros are known, the appropriate choice of certain design parameters, without using any adaptive law, leads to closed-loop stability and perfect regulation. This new control design is modified and supplemented with an update law to be applicable to LTV plants with unknown parameters. In the adaptive control design, the notion of structured parameter variations is used in order to include possible a priori information about the plant parameter variations. With this formulation, only the unstructured plant parameters are estimated and are required to be slowly time varying, and the structured plant parameters are allowed to have any finite speed of variation. The adaptive controller is shown to be robust with respect to the unknown but slow parameter variations in the global sense. We derive performance bounds which can be used to select certain design parameters for performance improvement. The properties of the proposed control scheme are demonstrated using simulation results.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2003.819074","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1245180","","Backstepping;Control systems;Time varying systems;Control design;Stability;Adaptive control;Nonlinear control systems;Nonlinear systems;Lyapunov method;Filters","time-varying systems;adaptive control;control system synthesis;parameter estimation;robust control;closed loop systems;asymptotic stability;Lyapunov methods","linear time-varying systems;known parameters;unknown parameters;backstepping control design procedure;stabilizing controllers;stability properties;Lyapunov function;parametrization structure;filter structure;exponential convergence;tracking error;closed-loop stability;perfect regulation;adaptive control design;structured parameter variations;unstructured plant parameters;performance bounds;simulation results;certainty equivalence;parametric robustness","","73","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The gain and emission spectra can be determined for transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarizations and by summing the recombination currents for each polarization the total radiative current can be measured. This enables the overall internal radiative quantum efficiency to be calculated. Once the calibration factor is known the internal stimulated recombination rate at the facet can also be estimated. The experiment can be configured to give a measurement of the passive modal absorption of the gain medium. The internal optical mode loss can be determined from the long-wavelength region of the gain spectrum or the modal absorption spectrum.

While a number of significant challenges remain to be overcome, including device parasitics, interfaces, and threshold voltage control techniques, it appears that the continued evolution of CMOS integrated circuit technology into this regime will not be impeded by basic limitations of the underlying transistor technology.

Excellent range resolution and high resistance to electronic countermeasures (ECM) can be achieved by long wideband modulated pulses, which spread out the transmitted energy in frequency and time. By using random noise as the waveform, the range ambiguity can be suppressed as well. In this paper, noise radar for Doppler/range indication and digital beamforming is described. Main factors influencing the resolution and sidelobe level in range and Doppler are surveyed. In particular, the possible use of binary or low-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) in noise radar is analyzed, which highly improves the signal-processing rate and reduces the costs. The very significant improvement of sidelobe suppression, when an extra noise signal is added before ADC, is explained theoretically and confirmed by simulation results. Mostly, the random signal is transmitted directly from a noise generating high-frequency source. A sine wave, which is phase or frequency modulated by random noise, is an alternative, giving lower range sidelobes, and higher transmitted mean power when peak-limited transmitters are applied. The dynamic requirements and the bandwidth of the modulating signal can be reduced as well.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.816665","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1260607","","Doppler radar;Array signal processing;Radar countermeasures;Radar applications;Energy resolution;Electronic countermeasures;Pulse modulation;Frequency;Pulse compression methods;Wideband","Doppler radar;analogue-digital conversion;random noise;radar resolution;radar interference;interference suppression;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar","noise radar;Doppler processing;digital beamforming;extra noise signal high-frequency source;low-bit ADC;pulse compression radar;random noise;range ambiguity;analog-to-digital converters;signal-processing rate;sidelobe suppression","","49","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, there is a need to transmit electric power from its sources to the points of utilization. Perhaps the most important way this is done is by overhead electric power transmission lines.

The problem is formulated in the framework of linear inverse problem and the solution makes use of the singular value decomposition of the relevant operator.

Although its stability analysis must be studied depending on a nonlinear model, most prior research attempted to make some assumptions to force this nonlinear system to be linear. As a result, the practical dynamics and the nonlinear phenomena were disregarded. In this paper, two kinds of nonlinear phenomena are detected under the conditions that are considered to be stable by the prior criteria: one is period-doubling bifurcation and the other is chaos. Stability maps and phase-plane trajectories are introduced at different loads to clarify the power factor and also the instability regions. It is clear that the output storage capacitor is a main contributing parameter on the system stability, therefore, bifurcation maps are developed to determine the accurate minimum output capacitance value that assures the system stability under all operating conditions. Also, PFC converter stability is explained and judged by comparing the consequence of charging and discharging energy in the output capacitor.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2003.819576","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254616","","Nonlinear dynamical systems;Nonlinear systems;Bifurcation;Capacitors;Nonlinear control systems;Control systems;Stability analysis;Power system modeling;Chaos;Trajectory","power factor correction;DC-DC power convertors;bifurcation;state-space methods;nonlinear dynamical systems;chaos;power system dynamic stability","power-factor-correction converter;nonlinear dynamics;boost converter;average-current-mode control;large duty ratio variation;period-doubling bifurcation;chaos;stability maps;output storage capacitor;switch-mode power supplies;state-space equations","","103","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our designs are based either on parameterizations of unitary matrices, or on algebraic number-theoretic constructions. With an arbitrary number of N/sub t/ transmit- and N/sub r/ receive-antennas, ST-LCP achieves rate 1 symbol/s/Hz and enjoys diversity gain as high as N/sub t/N/sub r/ over (possibly correlated) quasi-static and fast fading channels. As figures of merit, we use diversity and coding gains, as well as mutual information of the underlying multiple-input-multiple-output system. We show that over quadrature-amplitude modulation and pulse-amplitude modulation, our LCP achieves the upper bound on the coding gain of all linear precoders for certain values of N/sub t/ and comes close to this upper bound for other values of N/sub t/, in both correlated and independent fading channels. Compared with existing ST block codes adhering to an orthogonal design (ST-OD), ST-LCP offers not only better performance, but also higher mutual information for N/sub t/>2. For decoding ST-LCP, we adopt the near-optimum sphere-decoding algorithm, as well as reduced-complexity suboptimum alternatives. Although ST-OD codes afford simpler decoding, the tradeoff between performance and rate versus complexity favors the ST-LCP codes when N/sub t/, N/sub r/, or the spectral efficiency of the system increase.

Using the Green's function approach, the integral equations for the conformal-strip and parasitic-patch currents are formulated by matching the appropriate boundary conditions. The equations are then solved using the method of moments (MoM). In using the MoM, both the rigorous and simplified current expansions are used for the parasitic patch, and their results are compared with each other. In each case, the impedance integrals are evaluated by virtue of newly obtained recurrence formulas and direct analytical integration. Hence, the results can be calculated very efficiently without the need for any numerical integration, which greatly facilitates the numerical implementation.

Strong light injection can increase the semiconductor laser bandwidth to several times the free-running relaxation oscillation bandwidth. We focused on the fact that an injection-locked semiconductor laser can operate at an optical frequency different from its cavity resonance condition. Resonance is shifted from solitary resonance through the carrier-induced refractive-index change due to strong optical injection. We then framed a theory in which the enhanced resonance can be generated by transient interference between the injection-locked field and the field corresponding to the shifted cavity resonance. To examine the theory, we numerically investigated the rate equations and found that the numerical and theoretical results agree well over a wide range for strong injection. A stability analysis for the rate equations revealed that there is a mode transition from relaxation oscillation to interference-induced oscillation with increased injection, and the relaxation oscillation can become suppressed for higher injection levels. We believed that negligibly small fluctuations of the carrier suppressed the relaxation oscillation and examined it numerically. We also predict that, at strong injection levels, semiconductor lasers can be lower-dimensional systems because of the possibility of adiabatic elimination of the carrier. We further conclude that such low-dimensional systems can generate a high-frequency interference beat in the laser cavity and the resultant enhanced resonance.","1558-1713","","10.1109/JQE.2003.817583","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1233721","","Resonance;Bandwidth;Semiconductor lasers;Laser theory;Optical refraction;Equations;Frequency;Stability analysis;Interference suppression;Fluctuations","laser mode locking;semiconductor lasers;semiconductor device models;laser theory;laser cavity resonators;laser stability;fluctuations","cavity resonance shift;bandwidth enhancement;semiconductor lasers;strong light injection;physical mechanism;injection-locked semiconductor lasers;free-running relaxation oscillation bandwidth;cavity resonance condition;solitary resonance;induced refractive-index change;strong optical injection;transient interference;shifted cavity resonance;strong injection;interference-induced oscillation;relaxation oscillation;injection levels;adiabatic carrier elimination;high-frequency interference beat;laser cavity;enhanced resonance","","155","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

They have the advantages that the receivers are passive, and hence undetectable. The receiving systems are also potentially simple and cheap. Bistatic radar may have a counter-stealth capability, since target shaping to reduce monostatic RCS will in general not reduce the bistatic RCS. In spite of those advantages, rather few bistatic radar systems have got past the 'technology demonstrator' phase. It has also been remarked that activity in bistatic radar tends to vary on a period of approximately fifteen years, and that currently we are at a peak of that cycle; there is particular current interest in passive coherent location (PCL) techniques, using broadcast and communications signals as 'illuminators of opportunity'.

The n-well is suspended by front-end bulk-micromachining of the fabricated CMOS dies using electrochemical etch-stop technique in TMAH. Since this approach does not require any lithography or infrared sensitive material deposition after CMOS fabrication, the detector cost is almost equal to the CMOS chip cost. The n-well has a TCR of 0.5-0.7%/K, relatively low compared to state-of-the-art microbolometer materials; however, it has negligible 1/f noise due to its single crystal structure. The use of polysilicon interconnects on the support arms instead of metal reduces the overall pixel TCR to 0.34%/K, but provides a better performance due to improved thermal isolation. Based on this pixel, a 16 /spl times/ 16 prototype focal plane array (FPA) with 80 /spl mu/m /spl times/ 80 /spl mu/m pixel size and 13% fill factor has been implemented, where built-in diodes are used to simplify array scanning, at the expense of reduced overall pixel TCR of 0.24%/K. The n-well microbolometer array with a simple readout scheme provides a responsivity of 2000 V/W, a detectivity of 2.6 /spl times/ 10/sup 8/ cmHz/sup 1/2//W, and an estimated NETD of 200 mK at 0.5 Hz frame rate. Considering that this performance can be further improved with low noise readout circuits, the CMOS n-well microbolometer is a cost-effective approach to implement very low-cost uncooled infrared detector arrays with reasonable performance.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2002.807453","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1196096","","Infrared detectors;Micromachining;Integrated circuit fabrication;Silicon;Bolometers","infrared detectors;focal planes;CMOS image sensors;micromachining;integrated circuit technology;silicon;bolometers;thermal analysis","low-cost uncooled IR detector arrays;uncooled infrared detector arrays;standard CMOS technology;IR microbolometer detector;commercial CMOS process;CMOS n-well layer IR sensitive material;n-well suspension;front-end bulk-micromachining;electrochemical etch-stop technique;TMAH;support arm polysilicon interconnects;focal plane array;FPA;built-in diodes;low noise readout circuits;pixel distributed thermal model;21 ms;4 kHz;0.8 micron;80 micron;0.5 Hz;74 micron;Si","","68","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This type of system presents particular advantages to naval ship propulsion systems which rely on high power quality, survivable drives. New control methods are described involving both joint and separate control of the individual three-level inverters. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of both controls. A laboratory set-up at the Naval Surface Warfare Center power electronics laboratory was used to validate the proposed joint-inverter control.

Lab., The Hague, Netherlands","IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","2003","41","9","1950","1958","In single-band and single-polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image classification, texture holds useful information. In a study to assess the map-updating capabilities of such sensors in urban areas, some modern texture measures were investigated. Among them were histogram measures, wavelet energy, fractal dimension, lacunarity, and semivariograms. The latter were chosen as an alternative for the well-known gray-level cooccurrence family of features. The area that was studied using a European Remote Sensing Satellite 1 (ERS-1) SAR image was the conurbation around Rotterdam and The Hague in The Netherlands. The area can be characterized as a well-planned dispersed urban area with residential areas, industry, greenhouses, pasture, arable land, and some forest. The digital map to be updated was a 1:250000 Vector Map (VMap1). The study was done on the basis of nonparametric separability measures and classification techniques because most texture distributions were not normal. The conclusion is that texture improves the classification accuracy. The measures that performed best were mean intensity (actually no texture), variance, weighted-rank fill ratio, and semivariogram, but the accuracies vary for different classes. Despite the improvement, the overall classification accuracy indicates that the land-cover information content of ERS-1 leaves something to be desired.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.814628","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232209","","Image analysis;Image texture analysis;Urban areas;Synthetic aperture radar;Image classification;Area measurement;Histograms;Energy measurement;Fractals;Remote sensing","terrain mapping;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;spaceborne radar;image classification;radar imaging;image texture","The Netherlands;Rotterdam;The Hague;urban areas;image texture analysis;image classification;synthetic aperture radar;SAR;terrain mapping","","146","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The technique enjoys numerous applications in biomedical signal analysis in the literature, especially in the analysis of electromagnetic (EM) brain signals. Standard implementations of ICA are restrictive mainly due to the square mixing assumption-for signal recordings which have large numbers of channels, the large number of resulting extracted sources makes the subsequent analysis laborious and highly subjective. There are many instances in neurophysiological analysis where there is strong a priori information about the signals being sought; temporally constrained ICA (cICA) can extract signals that are statistically independent, yet which are constrained to be similar to some reference signal which can incorporate such a priori information. We demonstrate this method on a synthetic dataset and on a number of artifactual waveforms identified in multichannel recordings of EEG and MEG. cICA repeatedly converges to the desired component within a few iterations and subjective analysis shows the waveforms to be of the expected morphologies and with realistic spatial distributions. This paper shows that cICA can be applied with great success to EM brain signal analysis, with an initial application in automating artifact extraction in EEG and MEG.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2003.816076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1220217","","Independent component analysis;Signal analysis;Electroencephalography;Biomedical measurements;Data mining;Biomedical engineering;Digital recording;Principal component analysis;Electromagnetic measurements;Electromagnetic analysis","electroencephalography;magnetoencephalography;medical signal processing;independent component analysis;iterative methods","temporally constrained independent component analysis;artifact rejection;electromagnetic brain signal analysis;reference signal;EM brain signal analysis;realistic spatial distributions;strong a priori information;signals extraction;neurophysiological analysis;artifact extraction automation;square mixing assumption;EEG;MEG;signal recordings;extracted sources;synthetic dataset","Algorithms;Brain;Brain Mapping;Computer Simulation;Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Epilepsy;Humans;Magnetoencephalography;Models, Neurological;Models, Statistical;Principal Component Analysis;Quality Control","185","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Their analysis most often concerns the computation of steady-state and transient-state probabilities. This paper introduces a branching temporal logic for expressing real-time probabilistic properties on CTMCs and presents approximate model checking algorithms for this logic. The logic, an extension of the continuous stochastic logic CSL of Aziz et al. (1995, 2000), contains a time-bounded until operator to express probabilistic timing properties over paths as well as an operator to express steady-state probabilities. We show that the model checking problem for this logic reduces to a system of linear equations (for unbounded until and the steady-state operator) and a Volterra integral equation system (for time-bounded until). We then show that the problem of model-checking time-bounded until properties can be reduced to the problem of computing transient state probabilities for CTMCs. This allows the verification of probabilistic timing properties by efficient techniques for transient analysis for CTMCs such as uniformization. Finally, we show that a variant of lumping equivalence (bisimulation), a well-known notion for aggregating CTMCs, preserves the validity of all formulas in the logic.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2003.1205180","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1205180","","Steady-state;Stochastic processes;Probabilistic logic;Transient analysis;System performance;Timing;Integral equations;Performance analysis;Throughput;Production systems","Markov processes;formal verification;probability;temporal logic;bisimulation equivalence;timing;Volterra equations","continuous-time Markov chains;model-checking algorithms;system performance;system dependability;transient-state probabilities;steady-state probabilities;branching temporal logic;real-time probabilistic properties;continuous stochastic logic;time-bounded until operator;probabilistic timing properties;linear equations;Volterra integral equation system;uniformization;lumping equivalence;bisimulation","","438","","72","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such a phase-controlled mode-locked laser forms the foundation of a ""femtosecond optical-frequency comb generator"" with a regular comb of sharp lines with well-defined frequencies. For a comb with sufficiently broad bandwidth, it is now straightforward to determine the absolute frequencies of all of the comb lines. This ability has revolutionized optical-frequency metrology, synthesis, and optical atomic clocks. Precision femtosecond optical-frequency combs also have a major impact on time-domain applications, including carrier-envelope phase stabilization, synthesis of a single pulse from two independent lasers, nonlinear spectroscopy, and passive amplifiers based on empty external optical cavities. The authors first review the frequency-domain description of a mode-locked laser and the connection between the carrier-envelope phase and the frequency spectrum to provide a basis for understanding how the absolute frequencies can be determined and controlled. Using this understanding, applications in optical-frequency metrology and synthesis and optical atomic clocks are discussed.

For launch to orbit, even long launchers (>1000 m) would need to operate at accelerations >1000 gees to reach the required velocities, so that it would only be possible to launch rugged payloads, such as fuel, water, and material. A railgun system concept is described here and technology development issues are identified.

It is assumed that each node in the network senses an environment that can be described as a mixture of some elementary conditions. The measurements are thus statistically modeled with a mixture of Gaussians, where each Gaussian component corresponds to one of the elementary conditions. The paper presents a distributed expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating the Gaussian components, which are common to the environment and sensor network as a whole, as well as the mixing probabilities that may vary from node to node. The algorithm produces an estimate (in terms of a Gaussian mixture approximation) of the density of the sensor data without requiring the data to be transmitted to and processed at a central location. Alternatively, the algorithm can be viewed as a distributed processing strategy for clustering the sensor data into components corresponding to predominant environmental features sensed by the network. The convergence of the distributed EM algorithm is investigated, and simulations demonstrate the potential of this approach to sensor network data analysis.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2003.814623","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1212679","","Clustering algorithms;Gaussian processes;Gaussian distribution;Probability;Approximation algorithms;Gaussian approximation;Distributed processing;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Convergence;Analytical models","distributed algorithms;distributed sensors;parameter estimation;Gaussian distribution;optimisation;telecommunication networks;signal processing;statistical analysis","distributed EM algorithms;density estimation;clustering;sensor networks;Gaussian mixture approximation;distributed expectation-maximization algorithm;distributed processing strategy;data processing","","168","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to compare the proposed algorithm with the conventional radix-4 algorithm, the 64-point MDC pipelined FFT processor based on the proposed algorithm was implemented. After the logic synthesis using 0.35 /spl mu/m CMOS technology, the logic gate count for the processor with the proposed algorithm is only about 70% of that for the processor with the conventional radix-4 algorithm.

We have shown that semiautomated vehicles do not contribute to the slinky effect phenomenon when the lead manual vehicle performs smooth acceleration maneuvers. We have demonstrated that semiautomated vehicles help smooth traffic flow by filtering the response of rapidly accelerating lead vehicles. The accurate speed tracking and the smooth response of the semiautomated vehicles designed for passenger comfort reduces fuel consumption and levels of pollutants of following vehicles. This reduction is significant when the lead manual vehicle performs rapid acceleration maneuvers. We have demonstrated using simulations that the fuel consumption and pollution levels present in manual traffic can be reduced during rapid acceleration transients by 28.5% and 1.5%-60.6%, respectively, due to the presence of 10% semiautomated vehicles.

A shipboard power distribution system is a stiff, isolated power system that is vulnerable to system transients. Power quality problems, such as voltage sags, which arise due to a fault or a pulsed load, can cause interruptions of critical loads. Critical loads include radar systems, pumps and weapon systems. A series voltage injection type flywheel energy storage system is proposed to mitigate voltage sap and maximize the survivability of the ship. The bask circuit consists of an energy storage system, power electronic interface and a series injection transformer. In this case the energy storage system consists of a flywheel coupled to an induction machine. The flywheel stores energy In the form of kinetic energy and the induction machine is used for energy conversion. The power electronic interface facilitates the bi-directional flow of power for charging and discharging the flywheel through the induction machine. The stored energy is used for sag correction when the critical load sees a voltage sag. Indirect field oriented control with space vector PWM is used to control the induction machine.

ITRS power guidelines below the 25 nm technology node should be revised if isothermal scaling of thin-body devices is desired.","","0-7803-7872-5","10.1109/IEDM.2003.1269420","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269420","","Thermal conductivity;Phonons;Thermal resistance;Silicon on insulator technology;Conductive films;Semiconductor films;FinFETs;Space technology;Impurities;Scattering","MOSFET;silicon-on-insulator;thermal analysis;semiconductor device models;heat conduction","ultra-thin body device scaling;thermal analysis;confined dimensions;self-heating;SOI;FinFET;compact thermal model;nanoscale heat conduction;drain extension dimensions;channel extension dimensions;isothermal scaling;UTB silicon-on-insulator devices;25 nm","","29","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Modularity refers to a new product development strategy in which interfaces shared among components in a given product architecture are specified and standardized to allow for greater substitutability of components across product families. It is argued that the degree of modularity inherent in product architectures depends on the constituent components and interfaces. This paper introduces a mathematical model, termed the modularization function, for analyzing the degree of modularity in a given product architecture. It takes into account the following variables: components; degree of coupling; and substitutability of new-to-the-firm components. The application of the modularization function is illustrated with two elevator systems from Schindler-traction and hydraulic. The comparative analysis of the elevators captures the sensitivity and dynamics of product architecture modularity created by three types of components (standard, neutral, and unique) and two types of interfaces (fundamental and optional).","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2003.810826","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1202983","","Product development;Elevators","product development;innovation management;lifts","product architectures modularity management;integrated theory;innovation management;firms;product development strategy;product families;mathematical model;modularization function;components;elevator systems;interfaces","","158","","55","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Ergodic channel capacity with several different values of channel parameter /spl sigma/ and outage probabilities are computed to provide an information-theoretic view of the channel. Turbo codes matched to the channel are also investigated to shed insight into how much can be achieved with state-of-the-art coding schemes.

A conventional quadtree-based path planning approach is simple, robust, and efficient. However, it has two limitations. We propose a path graph optimization technique employing a compact mesh representation. A world space is triangulated into a base mesh and the base mesh is simplified to a compact mesh. The compact mesh representation is object-dependent; the positions of vertexes of the mesh are optimized according to the curvatures of the obstacles. The compact mesh represents the obstacles as accurately as the quadtree even though using much fewer vertexes than the quadtree. The compact mesh distributes vertexes in a free space in a balanced way by ensuring that the lengths of edges are below an edge length threshold. An optimized path graph is extracted from the compact mesh. An iterative vertex pushing method is proposed to include important obstacle boundary edges in the path graph. Dijkstra's shortest path searching algorithm is used to search the shortest path in the path graph. Experimental results show that the path planning using the optimized path graph is an order of magnitude faster than the quadtree approach while the length of the path generated by the proposed method is almost the same as that of the path generated by the quadtree.","1558-2426","","10.1109/TSMCA.2003.812599","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1206461","","Path planning;Skeleton;Optimization methods;Shape;Robots;Application software;Space technology;Robustness;Costs;Iterative methods","path planning;graph theory;search problems;computational geometry;computational complexity;iterative methods;robots","fast path planning;path graph optimization;compact mesh representation;world space triangulation;iterative vertex pushing method;Dijkstra's shortest path searching algorithm;motion planning","","53","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The need for the more efficient extraction of information from high resolution RS imagery and the seamless integration of this information into Geographic Information System (GIS) databases is driving geo-information theory, and methodology, into new territory. As the dimension of the ground instantaneous field of view (GIFOV), or pixel size, decreases many more fine landscape features can be readily delineated, at least visually. The challenge has been to produce proven man-machine methods that externalize and improve on human interpretation skills. Some of the most promising results come from the adoption of image segmentation algorithms and the development of so-called object-based classification methodologies. This paper builds on a discussion of different approaches to image segmentation techniques and demonstrates through several applications how segmentation and object-based methods improve on pixel-based image analysis/classification methods. In contrast to pixel-based procedure, image objects can carry many more attributes than only spectral information. In this paper, I address the concepts of object-based image processing, and present an approach that integrates the concept of object-based processing into the image classification process. Object-based processing not only considers contextual information but also information about the shape of and the spatial relations between the image regions.","","0-7803-8350-8","10.1109/WARSD.2003.1295182","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1295182","","Image classification;Image segmentation;Spatial resolution;Geographic Information Systems;Pixel;Remote sensing;Data mining;Image resolution;Image databases;Spatial databases","geographic information systems;image classification;image segmentation;remote sensing;visual databases","object based contextual image classification;image segmentation;spatial resolution;remote sensing sensors;information extraction;high resolution remote sensing imagery;geographic information system database;man machine methods;geo information theory;human interpretation skills;object based classification;pixel based image analysis;object based image processing;ground instantaneous field of view","","28","","41","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The radar measurements give detailed information about the movements of the human body parts; the Doppler signatures are time-varying and observed in the spectrogram. The authors focus on the extraction of parameters and describe a method for estimating human walking parameters from radar measurements. The parameters are estimated by minimising the difference between a simulated model and real measurements. A human walking model is presented which can be used both to calculate the radar response and visually to animate a walking person. The method is applied to real radar measurements of inbound walking humans from a distance of 20 m. The results show that estimation of the walking parameters is possible.

This is the driving concept behind the optimization algorithm introduced in this paper that makes use of the intra and intersociety interactions within a formal society and the civilization model to solve single objective constrained optimization problems. A society corresponds to a cluster of points in the parametric space while a civilization is a set of all such societies. Every society has its set of better performing individuals (leaders) that help others to improve through information exchange. This results in the migration of a point toward a better performing point, analogous to an intensified local search. Leaders improve only through an intersociety information exchange that results in the migration of a leader from a society to another.

Although there are various techniques to achieve dual-band operation from various types of microstrip antennas, there is no efficient design tool that has been incorporated with a suitable optimization algorithm. In this paper, the cavity-model based simulation tool along with the genetic optimization algorithm is presented for the design of dual-band microstrip antennas, using multiple slots in the patch or multiple shorting strips between the patch and the ground plane. Since this approach is based on the cavity model, the multiport approach is efficiently employed to analyze the effects of the slots and shorting strips on the input impedance. Then, the optimization of the positions of slots and shorting strips is performed via a genetic optimization algorithm, to achieve an acceptable antenna operation over the desired frequency bands. The antennas designed by this efficient design procedure were realized experimentally, and the results are compared. In addition, these results are also compared to the results obtained by the commercial electromagnetic simulation tool, the FEM-based software HFSS by ANSOFT.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2003.814732","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1219605","","Microstrip antennas;Algorithm design and analysis;Genetics;Design optimization;Frequency;Dual band;Slot antennas;Wireless communication;Global Positioning System;GSM","multifrequency antennas;microstrip antennas;probes;antenna feeds;CAD;genetic algorithms;digital simulation;electric impedance;electrical engineering computing","dual-frequency probe-fed microstrip antennas;microstrip antenna design;wireless communication systems;GPS;GSM services;frequency bands;PCS;IMT-2000;optimization algorithm;cavity-model based simulation tool;genetic optimization algorithm;dual-band microstrip antennas;multiple slots;multiple shorting strips;ground plane;multiport approach;input impedance;commercial electromagnetic simulation tool;HFSS FEM-based software;CAD tool;ANSOFT","","25","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The first decision stage is to check if there is a existing fire by extracting fire-pixels from visual images. In color image processing, the RGB (red, green, blue) color model has less computational complexity than other color models and hence is adopted to describe fire pixels. The decision function of fire-pixels can be deduced by the saturation of R component and fire's dynamic features. In the second decision stage, if the number of extracted fire pixels is increasing with burning time and greater than someone threshold during a time interval, a fire alarm is given to avoid leading to a disaster. To reduce false-alarm rate, the second decision process is repeated with several times at an adaptive thresholding way. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is very attractive for the important military, social security, forest-fire alarm, commercial applications, and so on.","","0-7803-7882-2","10.1109/CCST.2003.1297544","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1297544","","Fires;Color;Cameras;Tires;Image processing;Image sampling;Infrared detectors;Gray-scale;Smoke detectors;Costs","feature extraction;computer vision;image colour analysis;fires;surveillance;video signal processing;alarm systems","intelligent real-time fire-detection method;video processing;fire surveillance;computer vision;2-stage decision strategy;visual images;color image processing;RGB color model;computational complexity;fire pixels;fire alarm;feature extraction;false-alarm rate;adaptive thresholding;military;social security;forest-fire alarm","","31","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The quasi-2-D analyses, which can apply to double-gate devices as well, also provide a simple expression to estimate the effective channel length (L/sub eff/) of FD/SOI MOSFETs. The insightful results show that threshold-voltage control via channel doping and polysilicon gates is not a viable option for extremely scaled FD/SOI CMOS, and hence that undoped channels and metal gate(s) with tuned work function(s) must be employed. Quantitative as well as qualitative insights gained on the short-channel effects reveal the need for ultrathin films (t/sub Si/ < 10 nm) for L/sub eff/ < 50 nm. However, the implied manufacturing burden, compounded by effects of carrier-energy quantization for ultrathin t/sub Si/, forces a pragmatic limit on t/sub Si/ of about 5 nm, which in turn limits the scalability to L/sub eff/ = 25-30 nm. Unloaded CMOS-inverter ring-oscillator simulations, done with our process/physics-based compact model (UFDG) in SPICE3, show very good performance for L/sub eff/ = 35 nm, and suggest viable technology designs for low-power as well as high-performance applications. These simulations also reveal that moderate variations in t/sub Si/ can be tolerated, and that the energy quantization significantly influences the scaled-technology performance and hence must be properly accounted for in optimal FD/SOI MOSFET design.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2003.816915","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232929","","Silicon on insulator technology;CMOS integrated circuits;Integrated circuit modeling;Work function;Very-large-scale integration","silicon-on-insulator;CMOS integrated circuits;integrated circuit modelling;work function;VLSI","fully depleted SOI CMOS;quasi-2D device analyses;2-D numerical device simulations;circuit simulations;scalability;double-gate devices;effective channel length;FD/SOI MOSFETs;threshold-voltage control;undoped channels;tuned work function metal gates;short-channel effects;ultrathin films;carrier-energy quantization;process/physics-based compact model;UFDG;SPICE3;low-power applications;high-performance applications;scaled-technology performance;5 to 50 nm;Si","","80","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

No.03CH37475)","","2003","1","","7","12 Vol.1","In this paper, we consider a heterogeneous team of UAVs drawn from several distinct classes and engaged in a search and destroy mission over an extended battlefield. Several different types of targets are considered. Some target locations are suspected a priori with a certain probability, while the others are initially unknown. During the mission, the UAVs perform Search, Confirm, Attack and Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) tasks at various locations. The target locations are detected gradually through search, while the tasks are determined in real-time by the actions of all UAVs and their results (e.g., sensor readings), which makes the task dynamics stochastic. The tasks must, therefore, be allocated to UAVs in real-time as they arise. Each class of UAVs has its own sensing and attack capabilities with respect to the different target types, so the need for appropriate and efficient assignment is paramount. We present a simple cooperative approach to this problem, based on distributed assignment mediated through centralized mission status information. Using this information, each UAV assesses the task opportunities available to it, and makes commitments through a phased incremental process. This produces a simple, flexible, scalable and inherently decentralizable method for task allocation. Concurrently, every UAV also monitors the degree to which various parts of the environment have been searched, and accommodates this information in planning its paths. We study the effect of various decision parameters, target distributions, and UAV team characteristics on the performance of our approach.","0191-2216","0-7803-7924-1","10.1109/CDC.2003.1272527","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1272527","","Unmanned aerial vehicles;Vehicle dynamics;Remotely operated vehicles;Stochastic processes;Path planning;Intelligent systems;Intelligent vehicles;Control systems;Mobile robots;Weapons","remotely operated vehicles;mobile robots;path planning;military aircraft","cooperative real time search;task allocation;unmanned aerial vehicle teams;heterogeneous team;destroy mission;target locations detection;battle damage assessment tasks;sensor readings;task dynamics stochastic;sensing capabilities;attack capabilities;distributed assignments;centralized mission status information;phased incremental process;decentralizable method;path planning;decision parameters;target distributions","","34","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Pipelining and parallelizing allow inputs to be received at very high fiber-optic rates and outputs to be delivered at correspondingly high rates with minimum delay. A parallel processing architecture results in speed-ups of as much as or more than 10 Gb, since the maximum achievable clock frequency is generally bounded by the critical path of the modified Euclidean algorithm block. The parallel RS decoders have been designed and implemented with the 0.13-/spl mu/m CMOS standard cell technology in a supply voltage of 1.1 V. It is suggested that a parallel RS decoder, which can keep up with optical transmission rates, i.e., 10 Gb/s and beyond, could be implemented.

Large converters systems can also generate noncharacteristic harmonics and interharmonics. Standard tools of harmonic analysis based on the Fourier transform assume that only harmonics are present and the periodicity intervals are fixed, while periodicity intervals in the presence of interharmonics are variable and very long. A novel approach to harmonic and interharmonic analysis, based on the ""subspace"" methods, is proposed. Min-norm harmonic retrieval method is an example of high-resolution eigenstructure-based methods. The Prony method as applied for signal analysis was also tested for this purpose. Both high-resolution methods do not show the disadvantages of the traditional tools and allow exact estimation of the interharmonics frequencies. To investigate the methods several experiments were performed using simulated signals, current waveforms at the output of a simulated frequency converter, and current waveforms at the output of an industrial frequency converter. For comparison, similar experiments were repeated using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). The comparison proved the superiority of the new methods. However, their computation is much more complex than FFT.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2003.812361","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1203002","","Spectral analysis;Signal analysis;Power electronics;Frequency conversion;Harmonic analysis;Frequency estimation;Computational modeling;Power generation;Power system harmonics;Fourier transforms","power convertors;power conversion harmonics;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;frequency convertors;spectral analysis;fast Fourier transforms","advanced spectrum estimation methods;signal analysis;power electronics;frequency power converters;harmonic components;noncharacteristic harmonics;interharmonics;harmonic analysis;Fourier transform;periodicity intervals;interharmonic analysis;subspace methods;min-norm harmonic retrieval method;high-resolution eigenstructure-based methods;Prony method;high-resolution methods;simulated signals;current waveforms;simulated frequency converter;fast Fourier transform;power system harmonies;FFT","","109","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Environmental considerations promote the adoption of EV for urban transportation. As it is well known one of the weakest points of electric vehicle is the battery system. Vehicle autonomy and therefore accurate detection of battery state of charge are among the main drawbacks that prevent the spread of electric vehicles in the consumer market. This paper deals with the analysis of battery state of charge: performances of a few sizes of batteries are analyzed and their state of charge is estimated with a neural network (NN) based system. The obtained results have been used to design a lithium-ion battery pack suitable for electric vehicles. The proposed system presents high capability of energy recovering in braking conditions, together with charge equalization, over and under voltage protection. Moreover a neural network based estimation of battery state of charge has been implemented in order to optimize autonomy instead of performances or vice-versa depending on journey.","","0-7803-7817-2","10.1109/IEMDC.2003.1210310","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1210310","","Neural networks;State estimation;Electric vehicles;Performance analysis;Pollution;Engines;Transportation;Battery powered vehicles;Vehicle detection;Voltage","neural nets;secondary cells;power engineering computing;battery charge measurement;parameter estimation;braking;regenerative braking;battery powered vehicles","electric vehicles;neural network based estimation;pollution problems;gasoline-powered engine emissions;environmental considerations;urban transportation;vehicle autonomy;battery state of charge detection;Li-ion battery pack;energy recovery;braking conditions;charge equalization;undervoltage protection;overvoltage protection;Li","","20","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the past 20 years, stray flux sensors have been used for diagnostic purposes but rarely in the presence of a complex power supply such as a voltage static inverter. In this paper, it is proved that a simple external stray flux sensor is more efficient than the classical stator current signature analysis to detect inter-turn short circuit in three-phase induction machines. The new result is that, even in the presence of power supply harmonics, it is possible to easily detect the stator winding faults in the low-frequency range of the flux spectrum with low-frequency resolution.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2003.816531","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1233585","","Fault detection;Stator windings;Induction machines;Circuit faults;Voltage;Torque;Electrical fault detection;Condition monitoring;Signal processing;Power supplies","stators;fault location;squirrel cage motors;harmonic analysis;power supplies to apparatus;magnetic flux;magnetic variables measurement;invertors;short-circuit currents","frequency-domain detection;stator winding faults;external flux sensor;stator fault detection;induction machine;stray flux sensors;diagnostic purposes;power supply;voltage static inverter;stator current signature analysis;inter-turn short circuit detection;three-phase induction machines;power supply harmonics;low-frequency range;flux spectrum;low-frequency resolution;four-pole squirrel-cage induction motor;harmonic analysis;11 kW;50 Hz;230 V;400 V","","223","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

SDMs are built by performing a statistical analysis of the deformations required to map anatomical features in one subject into the corresponding features in another subject. The concept of SDMs is similar to statistical shape models (SSMs) which capture statistical information about shapes across a population, but offers several advantages over SSMs. First, SDMs can be constructed directly from images such as three-dimensional (3-D) magnetic resonance (MR) or computer tomography volumes without the need for segmentation which is usually a prerequisite for the construction of SSMs. Instead, a nonrigid registration algorithm based on free-form deformations and normalized mutual information is used to compute the deformations required to establish dense correspondences between the reference subject and the subjects in the population class under investigation. Second, SDMs allow the construction of an atlas of the average anatomy as well as its variability across a population of subjects. Finally, SDMs take the 3-D nature of the underlying anatomy into account by analysing dense 3-D deformation fields rather than only information about the surface shape of anatomical structures. We show results for the construction of anatomical models of the brain from the MR images of 25 different subjects. The correspondences obtained by the nonrigid registration are evaluated using anatomical landmark locations and show an average error of 1.40 mm at these anatomical landmark positions. We also demonstrate that SDMs can be constructed so as to minimize the bias toward the chosen reference subject.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2003.815865","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1216225","","Brain modeling;Deformable models;Anatomy;Shape;Statistical analysis;Magnetic resonance;Tomography;Image segmentation;Mutual information;Information analysis","brain models;image registration;biomedical MRI;computerised tomography;medical image processing;statistical analysis","3-D statistical deformation models;nonrigid registration;automatic construction;anatomical models construction;MR images;CT images;magnetic resonance imaging;medical diagnostic imaging;chosen reference subject;free-form deformations;normalized mutual information","Algorithms;Anatomy, Cross-Sectional;Brain;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Reproducibility of Results;Schizophrenia;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique;Tomography, X-Ray Computed","273","","46","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, because this is just one customer out of hundreds or thousands on the feeder, the improvement does not show up the utility's traditional reliability indices. There can be a positive or negative impact on the utility-level indices in these cases: DG can reduce the number or the duration of sustained interruptions if automated switches are available to restore power in DG-supplied islands or to DG-supported alternate feeds; the loss of fuse-saving on laterals can significantly degrade the utility-level indices. There is little opportunity for DG to affect the PQ of other customers, as measured by the indices for voltage sags, which are related to faults and interruptions. DG can still have adverse impacts on harmonics and steady-state voltage regulation, which are other aspects of PQ. Utilities should consider tracking ASIFI, ASIDI, and other indices that are based on load size rather than the number of customers. As a supplement to the traditional reliability indices, these would better show the positive impacts of DG, assuming DG owners tend to be larger customers.","1558-0598","","10.1109/MIA.2003.1227867","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1227867","","Voltage;Power quality;Equipment failure;Power generation;Power system reliability;Investments;World Wide Web;Power measurement;Distributed power generation;Power generation economics","distributed power generation;power system reliability;power supply quality","distributed generation;reliability;power quality;utility-level indices;automated switches;power restoration;fuse-saving;interruptions;faults;load size","","52","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

However, a close examination of the applications in motor drives and power supplies indicates that there has been no dramatic volume reduction of the subsystem. The power semiconductor modules have shrunk the power switching part of the converter, but the bulk of the subsystem volume still comprises the associated control, sensing, electromagnetic power passives (inductors, transformers, capacitors) and interconnects. This paper addresses the improvement of power processing technology through advanced integration of power electronics. The goal of a subsystem in a module necessitates this advanced integration, incorporating active switching stages, EMI-filters and electromagnetic power passives into modules. The central philosophy of the technology development research in the National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Power Electronic Systems is to advance the state of the art by providing the concept of integrated power electronics modules (IPEMs) for all these functions.

To reduce the input PD noise without degrading the PLL DC gain and the loop bandwidth, a multilevel PD can be used instead.

Since UPWM is conceptually simple and involves few steps, it is possible that computation may be reduced in practice. UPWM algorithms can avoid the sector and switch sequence tracking tasks in an SVM algorithm. The linear modulation range extension ""inherent"" to SVM is associated with triplen harmonic injection, and does not provide advantages over conventional third-harmonic injection techniques. The equivalence of SVM and UPWM means that SVM has spectral distortion in baseband as is known to occur in UPWM.

For this purpose, an algorithm is developed. The applied algorithm uses a hybrid model which is a combination of the multi-conductor transmission line model (MTLM) and the single-transmission line model (STLM). By means of the STLM, the voltages at the end of each coil are calculated. Then, these values are used in the MTLM to determine the distributed overvoltages along the turns. Also, this method significantly reduces the number of linear equations that need to be solved for each frequency to determine the required voltages in frequency domain. The algorithm uses a modified continuous Fourier transformation that provides an accurate time domain computation.

Computed tomography (CT) scanning can be used to obtain detailed images of the pulmonary anatomy, including the airways. These images have been used to measure airway geometry, study airway reactivity, and guide surgical interventions. Prior to these applications, airway segmentation can be used to identify the airway lumen in the CT images. Airway tree segmentation can be performed manually by an image analyst, but the complexity of the tree makes manual segmentation tedious and extremely time-consuming. We describe a fully automatic technique for segmenting the airway tree in three-dimensional (3-D) CT images of the thorax. We use grayscale morphological reconstruction to identify candidate airways on CT slices and then reconstruct a connected 3-D airway tree. After segmentation, we estimate airway branchpoints based on connectivity changes in the reconstructed tree. Compared to manual analysis on 3-mm-thick electron-beam CT images, the automatic approach has an overall airway branch detection sensitivity of approximately 73%.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2003.815905","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1216218","","Image segmentation;Image analysis;Humans;X-ray imaging;Computed tomography;Image reconstruction;Lungs;Anatomy;Geometry;Surgery","lung;medical image processing;computerised tomography;image segmentation;image reconstruction;mathematical morphology;data visualisation","human airway tree;three dimensional X-ray CT images;lungs;pulmonary airways;pulmonary anatomy;airway geometry;airway reactivity;surgical interventions;airway segmentation;airway lumen;3D CT images;grayscale morphological reconstruction;connected 3D airway tree;branchpoints;connectivity changes;volumetric imaging","Anatomy, Cross-Sectional;Bronchography;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Lung;Pulmonary Alveoli;Radiographic Image Enhancement;Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Trachea","141","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We argue that significant improvements in usable system lifetime can be achieved if the task allocation is aligned with the spatio-temporal characteristics of energy availability. To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been addressed before. We present a distributed framework for the sensor network to adaptively learn its energy environment and give localized algorithms to use this information for task sharing among nodes. Our framework allows the system to exploit its energy resources more efficiently, thus increasing its lifetime. These gains are in addition to those from utilizing sleep modes and residual energy based scheduling mechanisms.

The factors which were investigated are the shape of the stimulation waveform, the distance of the stimulating electrode from the recording system, the interelectrode distance of the detection system, the spatial filter used for signal detection, and the stimulation current amplitude. Surface EMG signals were recorded during electrical stimulation of the biceps brachii motor point with a linear adhesive array of eight electrodes. Electrical stimulation was applied with seven stimulation waveforms (mono- and biphasic triangular, sinusoidal, and rectangular), generated by a specifically designed neuromuscular stimulator with hybrid output stage. The stimulation peak current was linearly increased from 0 mA to the maximum tolerated by the subject. The detection systems investigated were single and double differential with interelectrode distances multiple of 5 mm. Two trials for each contraction were performed on three different days. The average rectified artifact values (both absolute and normalized with respect to the corresponding M-wave values) were computed to investigate the artifact amplitude properties. Results indicated that, while the artifact average rectified value, normalized with respect to the M-wave amplitude, depended on the distance of the detecting electrodes from the stimulation point, it did not depend on the stimulation waveform, on the current intensity, on the interelectrode distance, and on the spatial filter. It was concluded that, using hybrid stimulation techniques, the selection of particular stimulation waveforms, interelectrode distances, or spatial filters has a minor effect on the reduction of the artifact when recording M-waves.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2003.819791","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1261752","","Surface waves;Electromyography;Electrodes;Spatial filters;Electrical stimulation;Signal generators;Muscles;Shape;Signal detection;Hybrid power systems","electromyography;neuromuscular stimulation;medical signal detection;biomedical electrodes;spatial filters","stimulation artifact;surface EMG signal;electromyography;stimulation waveform;detection system;current amplitude;hybrid stimulation technique;transcutaneous electrical muscle stimulation;stimulating electrode;interelectrode distance;spatial filter;signal detection;biceps brachii motor point;neuromuscular stimulator;hybrid output stage;contraction;M-waves","Adult;Artifacts;Electric Stimulation;Electric Stimulation;Electrodes;Electromyography;Electromyography;Humans;Male;Muscle, Skeletal;Muscle, Skeletal;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation;Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation","35","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We then consider explicit congestion notification (ECN) as an alternate mechanism (instead of losses) for signaling congestion and show that ECN marking levels can be designed to nearly eliminate losses in the network by choosing the marking level independently for each node in the network.

This has triggered the development of many privacy-preserving data mining techniques. A large fraction of them use randomized data distortion techniques to mask the data for preserving the privacy of sensitive data. This methodology attempts to hide the sensitive data by randomly modifying the data values often using additive noise. We question the utility of the random value distortion technique in privacy preservation.

We present the theoretical foundation of this filtering method and extensive experimental results to demonstrate that in many cases random data distortion preserve very little data privacy.

The dimensions of the strips and slots of the nonperiodic output mirror are much smaller than the working wavelength; they are computed locally so that this mirror behaves as a spherical equiphase surface. Theoretical and experimental results show that the radiation patterns are symmetric and have low sidelobes. The antenna directivity is controlled by the value of the synthesized radius of curvature, that is to say by the nonperiodic distribution of the metal strips. It typically varies between 15 and 23.5 dB at 60 GHz.

The pixel candidates are selected from those presenting a good coherence level in the whole set of interferograms and the resulting nonuniform mesh tessellated with the Delauney triangulation to establish connections among them. The linear component of movement and DEM error are estimated adjusting a linear model to the data only on the connections. Later on, this information, once unwrapped to retrieve the absolute values, is used to calculate the nonlinear component of movement and atmospheric artifacts with alternate filtering techniques in both the temporal and spatial domains. The method presents high flexibility with respect to the required number of images and the baselines length. However, better results are obtained with large datasets of short baseline interferograms.

We first derive an upper bound on the pairwise codeword-error probability for transmission through channels with correlated turbulence-induced fading, which involves complicated multidimensional integration. To simplify the computations, we derive an approximate upper bound under the assumption of weak turbulence. The accuracy of this approximation under weak turbulence is verified by numerical simulation. Its invalidity when applied to strong turbulence is also shown. This simple approximate upper bound to the pairwise codeword-error probability is then applied to derive an upper bound to the bit-error probability for block codes, convolutional codes, and turbo codes for free-space optical communication through weak atmospheric turbulence channels.

The large power-frequency product represents a significant challenge for today's semiconductor technology. As the absolute maximum rating of a single-stage inverter is often far below rated power, several inverters or several devices have to be connected in parallel. This paper presents a novel topology, consisting of parallel-connected soft-switching high-frequency inverters. Distinctive features include flexible configurations, negligible shunt currents between inverters, and equally shared power among inverters. Furthermore, compared to a single-inverter system, no additional reactive components are necessary for connecting inverters in parallel and there is no need of a high-frequency transformer to adapt the impedance of the load to the inverters.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2003.809453","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1189234","","Inverters;Insulated gate bipolar transistors;Frequency;Phase locked loops;RLC circuits;Circuit topology;Switches;Welding;Strips;Joining processes","switching convertors;invertors;induction heating;high-frequency transformers","parallel connection;soft-switching high-power high-frequency inverters;inductive heating applications;pipe welding;steel strip annealing;electrical power ratings;power-frequency product;semiconductor technology;single-stage inverter;negligible shunt currents;inverters;equally shared power;single-inverter system;reactive components;high-frequency transformer;insulated gate bipolar transistor;IGBT;MOSFET;phase-locked loop;PLL;resonant circuit;voltage source inverter;VSI;100 kHz","","48","","4","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The settling time is about 3 /spl mu/s for 0.1 ppm (240 Hz) accuracy. Worst-case spurs are -53 dBc at 8-MHz offset from the carrier. The integrated phase noise in the band 1 kHz -1 MHz is 0.9/spl deg/ rms.

In the conventional method, estimation of positive and negative sequences is performed through two steps: the magnitude and phase-angle in each individual phase of the voltages are first estimated and the symmetrical component transformation is then applied. The proposed method offers a direct estimation of the positive and negative sequences that may reduce the estimation errors. In addition, the proposed method has a reduced computational cost since the number of state variables is reduced to 2/3 as compared to that in the conventional method.

Jacobs","Dept. of Neurosurg., Stanford Univ., CA, USA; Dept. of Neurosurg., Stanford Univ., CA, USA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","","2003","22","6","730","741","In this paper, we extend a previously reported intensity-based nonrigid registration algorithm by using a novel regularization term to constrain the deformation. Global motion is modeled by a rigid transformation while local motion is described by a free-form deformation based on B-splines. An information theoretic measure, normalized mutual information, is used as an intensity-based image similarity measure. Registration is performed by searching for the deformation that minimizes a cost function consisting of a weighted combination of the image similarity measure and a regularization term. The novel regularization term is a local volume-preservation (incompressibility) constraint, which is motivated by the assumption that soft tissue is incompressible for small deformations and short time periods. The incompressibility constraint is implemented by penalizing deviations of the Jacobian determinant of the deformation from unity. We apply the nonrigid registration algorithm with and without the incompressibility constraint to precontrast and postcontrast magnetic resonance (MR) breast images from 17 patients. Without using a constraint, the volume of contrast-enhancing lesions decreases by 1%-78% (mean 26%). Image improvement (motion artifact reduction) obtained using the new constraint is compared with that obtained using a smoothness constraint based on the bending energy of the coordinate grid by blinded visual assessment of maximum intensity projections of subtraction images. For both constraints, volume preservation improves, and motion artifact correction worsens, as the weight of the constraint penalty term increases. For a given volume change of the contrast-enhancing lesions (2% of the original volume), the incompressibility constraint reduces motion artifacts better than or equal to the smoothness constraint in 13 out of 17 cases (better in 9, equal in 4, worse in 4). The preliminary results suggest that incorporation of the incompressibility regularization term improves intensity-based free-form nonrigid registration of contrast-enhanced MR breast images by greatly reducing the problem of shrinkage of contrast-enhancing structures while simultaneously allowing motion artifacts to be substantially reduced.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2003.814791","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1211202","","Breast;Lesions;Deformable models;Spline;Mutual information;Performance evaluation;Cost function;Biological tissues;Jacobian matrices;Magnetic resonance","image registration;splines (mathematics);mammography;medical image processing;motion compensation;biomechanics;image enhancement;biomedical MRI","volume-preserving nonrigid registration;smoothness constraint;maximum intensity projections;subtraction images;MR breast images;free-form deformation;motion artifact correction;constraint penalty term weight;contrast-enhancing structures shrinkage;Jacobian determinant;coordinate grid;incompressibility constraint;contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images;mutual information;volume preservation","Adolescent;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Algorithms;Artifacts;Breast Neoplasms;Female;Humans;Image Enhancement;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Middle Aged;Motion;Quality Control;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Single-Blind Method;Subtraction Technique","282","","52","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The last application has had a great importance for humanitarian demining purposes taken into account the number of landmines spread across the world and the danger they pose to humans. Both, continuous wave and pulse radar have been employed for landmine detection. This paper deals with stepped frequency continuous wave (SFCW) radar that operates from 400 MHz to 4845 MHz, in steps of 35 MHz. The novelty of the system, built at International Research Center for Telecommunication-transmission and Radar (IRCTR), consists in the fact that 8 frequencies are transmitted simultaneously, which drastically decreases the data acquisition time. Because of the strong reflection from the air-ground interface one may face some difficulties to ""see"" the landmines, which are lying on, or just below of the surface. If the antenna system footprint is much more larger than the size of the mine, this is even more difficult as the signal from the mine will be buried in the clutter signal. In order to remove the clutter signal and to improve signal to clutter ratio, average clutter subtraction and synthetic aperture radar have been investigated.","","90-76928-04-5","10.1109/AGPR.2003.1207315","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1207315","","Frequency;Clutter;Landmine detection;Performance evaluation;Object detection;Navigation;Humans;Radar antennas;Data acquisition;Reflection","ground penetrating radar;military radar;landmine detection;radar clutter;radar signal processing;synthetic aperture radar;CW radar;radar antennas","stepped frequency continuous wave radar-data preprocessing;SFCW radar;International Research Center for Telecommunication-transmission and Radar;data acquisition time;air-ground interface;reflection;antenna system footprint;clutter signals;signal to clutter ratio;average clutter subtraction;synthetic aperture radar;target detection;subsurface sensing;humanitarian demining;landmine detection;400 to 4845 MHz","","17","","2","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed new algorithm moves particles towards nearby particles of higher fitness, instead of attracting each particle towards just the best position discovered so far by any particle. This is accomplished by using the ratio of the relative fitness and the distance of other particles to determine the direction in which each component of the particle position needs to be changed. The resulting algorithm (FDR-PSO) is shown to perform significantly better than the original PSO algorithm and some of its variants, on many different benchmark optimization problems. Empirical examination of the evolution of the particles demonstrates that the convergence of the algorithm does not occur at an early phase of particle evolution, unlike PSO.

Chiao Tung Univ., Hsinchu, Taiwan","IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","","2003","11","3","375","382","In modern manufacturing, the design of multi-axis motion controllers for high-speed/high-precision and complex machining is becoming more critical. In the past, controllers for each axis were, in general, designed individually to obtain desirable tracking accuracy. Although some advanced motion control algorithms have been developed recently, they are mostly applicable to single-axis or biaxial systems. In particular, the design of two-axis integrated control, which includes: 1) feedback loops; 2) feedforward loops; and 3) the cross-coupled control (CCC), achieves significantly improved performance. However, its applications are limited to basic linear and circular contour commands for two-axis systems only. In this paper, system analysis for the multi-axis integrated control structure is proposed in order to achieve tracking and contouring accuracy simultaneously. With the derived contouring error transfer function (CETF), the integrated control design for multi-axis motion systems can be formulated simply as a single-input-single-output (SISO) design. Thus, a robust design with desirable performance for multi-axis motion systems can then be achieved straightforwardly. Moreover, by estimating the contouring error vector, the proposed multi-axis integrated control can be widely applied to general contour commands. Experimental results on a three-axis CNC machining center indicate that both tracking and contouring accuracy are simultaneously improved by applying the proposed control design.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2003.810372","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1197329","","Centralized control;Motion analysis;Motion control;Error correction;Manufacturing;Machining;Feedback loop;Transfer functions;Robustness;Computer numerical control","feedforward;feedback;motion control;machining;computerised numerical control;control system synthesis;stability;control system analysis","multi-axis motion systems;modern manufacturing;tracking accuracy;single-axis systems;biaxial systems;two-axis integrated control;feedback loops;feedforward loops;cross-coupled control;system analysis;contouring accuracy;contouring error transfer function;single-input-single-output design;robust design;three-axis CNC machining center","","82","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Lett., vol.85, p.441, 2000) have provided a simple proof of security of the standard quantum key distribution scheme by Bennett and Brassard (1984) by demonstrating a connection between key distribution and entanglement purification protocols (EPPs) with one-way communications. Here, we provide proofs of security of standard quantum key distribution schemes, Bennett and Brassard and the six-state scheme, against the most general attack, by using the techniques of two-way entanglement purification. We demonstrate clearly the advantage of classical post-processing with two-way classical communications over classical post-processing with only one-way classical communications in quantum key distribution (QKD). This is done by the explicit construction of a new protocol for (the error correction/detection and privacy amplification of) Bennett and Brassard that can tolerate a bit error rate of up to 18.9%, which is higher than what any Bennett and Brassard scheme with only one-way classical communications can possibly tolerate. Moreover, we demonstrate the advantage of the six-state scheme over Bennett and Brassard by showing that the six-state scheme can strictly tolerate a higher bit error rate than Bennett and Brassard. In particular, our six-state protocol can tolerate a bit error rate of 26.4%, which is higher than the upper bound of 25% bit error rate for any secure Bennett and Brassard protocol. Consequently, our protocols may allow higher key generation rate and remain secure over longer distances than previous protocols. Our investigation suggests that two-way entanglement purification is a useful tool in the study of advantage distillation, error correction, and privacy amplification protocols.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2002.807289","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176619","","Quantum computing;Cryptographic protocols;Bit error rate;Cryptography;Purification;Privacy;Distributed computing;Security;Quantum entanglement;Error correction","quantum cryptography;protocols;error statistics;error correction;error detection","quantum key distribution security;two-way classical communications;entanglement purification protocols;distribution protocols;classical post-processing;error correction/detection;bit error rate;upper bound;secure protocol;distillation;error correction;privacy amplification protocols;BER","","168","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The admittance-type method of moments (MoM) is at first formulated to full-wave modeling of a finite-cell periodic CPW with the two feeding lines and then the short-open-calibration procedure is carried out to deembed the two-port ABCD matrix of the core periodic CPW section. Thus, the above two parameters can be extracted from the MoM simulation to exhibit their guided-wave characteristics, i.e., slow-wave and bandstop behaviors. It is demonstrated for the first time that, within the bandstop or bandgap, the propagation constant must become complex with a nonzero attenuation constant, while the characteristic impedance appears purely imaginary.

"Combining low-, high-level and empirical domain knowledge for automated segmentation of ultrasonic breast lesions","A. Madabhushi; D. N. Metaxas","Dept. of Bioeng., Pennsylvania Univ., Philadelphia, PA, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","","2003","22","2","155","169","Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy and the second leading cause of mortality in women . In the last decade, ultrasound along with digital mammography has come to be regarded as the gold standard for breast cancer diagnosis. Automatically detecting tumors and extracting lesion boundaries in ultrasound images is difficult due to their specular nature and the variance in shape and appearance of sonographic lesions. Past work on automated ultrasonic breast lesion segmentation has not addressed important issues such as shadowing artifacts or dealing with similar tumor like structures in the sonogram. Algorithms that claim to automatically classify ultrasonic breast lesions, rely on manual delineation of the tumor boundaries. In this paper, we present a novel technique to automatically find lesion margins in ultrasound images, by combining intensity and texture with empirical domain specific knowledge along with directional gradient and a deformable shape-based model. The images are first filtered to remove speckle noise and then contrast enhanced to emphasize the tumor regions. For the first time, a mathematical formulation of the empirical rules used by radiologists in detecting ultrasonic breast lesions, popularly known as the ""Stavros Criteria"" is presented in this paper. We have applied this formulation to automatically determine a seed point within the image. Probabilistic classification of image pixels based on intensity and texture is followed by region growing using the automatically determined seed point to obtain an initial segmentation of the lesion. Boundary points are found on the directional gradient of the image. Outliers are removed by a process of recursive refinement. These boundary points are then supplied as an initial estimate to a deformable model. Incorporating empirical domain specific knowledge along with low and high-level knowledge makes it possible to avoid shadowing artifacts and lowers the chance of confusing similar tumor like structures for the lesion. The system was validated on a database of breast sonograms for 42 patients. The average mean boundary error between manual and automated segmentation was 6.6 pixels and the normalized true positive area overlap was 75.1%. The algorithm was found to be robust to 1) variations in system parameters, 2) number of training samples used, and 3) the position of the seed point within the tumor. Running time for segmenting a single sonogram was 18 s on a 1.8-GHz Pentium machine.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2002.808364","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1194626","","Lesions;Breast neoplasms;Ultrasonic imaging;Sonogram;Breast cancer;Image segmentation;Shadow mapping;Deformable models;Mammography;Gold","mammography;image segmentation;cancer;biomedical ultrasonics;image texture;medical image processing;biological organs;tumours;edge detection;image classification","ultrasonic breast lesions;automated segmentation;empirical domain knowledge;high-level domain knowledge;low-level domain knowledge;breast cancer diagnosis;digital mammography;tumors;lesion boundaries;sonographic lesions;shadowing artifacts;similar tumor like structures;algorithms;tumor boundaries;intensity;texture;empirical domain specific knowledge;directional gradient;deformable shape-based model;speckle noise;tumor regions;mathematical formulation;empirical rules;Stavros Criteria;seed point;probabilistic classification;image pixels;recursive refinement;deformable model;average mean boundary error;normalized true positive area overlap;training samples;1.8-GHz Pentium machine;running time;1.8 GHz;18 s","Algorithms;Anatomy, Cross-Sectional;Artificial Intelligence;Breast Neoplasms;Breast Neoplasms;Female;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Predictive Value of Tests;Reproducibility of Results;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Ultrasonography, Mammary","183","","54","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These results are used to study the set invariance properties of continuous-time linear systems with input and state constraints. We show that, for a system under a given saturated linear feedback, the convex hull of a set of invariant ellipsoids is also invariant. If each ellipsoid in a set can be made invariant with a bounded control of the saturating actuators, then their convex hull can also be made invariant by the same actuators.

High capacities were found for full, as well as smaller array configurations, all within 80% of the fully scattering channel capacity. Correlation model parameters are derived from data. Spatial MIMO channel capacity statistics are found to be well represented by the separate transmitter and receiver correlation matrices, with a median relative error in capacity of 3%, in contrast with the 18% median relative error observed by assuming the antennas to be uncorrelated. A reduced parameter model, consisting of 4 parameters, has been developed to statistically represent the channel correlation matrices. These correlation matrices are, in turn, used to generate H matrices with capacities that are consistent within a few percent of those measured in New York. The spatial channel model reported allows simulations of H matrices for arbitrary antenna configurations. These channel matrices may be used to test receiver algorithms in system performance studies. These results may also be used for antenna array design, as the decay of mobile antenna correlation with antenna separation has been reported here. An important finding for the base transmitter array was that the antennas were largely uncorrelated even at antenna separations as small as two wavelengths.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2003.809457","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1192170","","MIMO;Transmitters;Transmitting antennas;Mobile antennas;Channel capacity;Antenna arrays;Narrowband;Scattering;Error analysis;Receiving antennas","UHF radio propagation;UHF measurement;MIMO systems;antenna arrays;receiving antennas;transmitting antennas;matrix algebra;correlation methods;channel capacity;electromagnetic wave scattering;mobile antennas;land mobile radio","multiple input multiple output measurements;MIMO measurements;Manhattan;UHF;antenna array configurations;scattering channel capacity;correlation model parameters;spatial MIMO channel capacity statistics;receiver correlation matrix;transmitter correlation matrix;median relative error;reduced parameter model;New York;receiver algorithms;system performance;antenna array design;mobile antenna correlation;base transmitter array;antenna separations;2.11 GHz","","190","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, an input-output description of quantum mechanical systems which is essential in describing the behavior of the feedback systems is fully formulated and developed. This would then provide a powerful tool for quantum control and pave an avenue that connects control theory to quantum dynamics. This paper is divided into two parts. The first part is devoted to the basic formulation of quantum feedback control via quantum communication and local operations on an optical device, cavity, that can be regarded as a unit of quantum dynamics of bosonic modes. The formulation introduced in this paper presents the feature intrinsic in quantum feedback systems based on quantum stochastic differential equations. The input-output description provides a basis for developing quantum feedback control through the transfer function representation of quantum feedback systems.

Waving trees, beaches, escalators, natural scenes with rain or snow are examples. Inspired by the work proposed by Doretto et al.

By reducing the signal bandwidth prior to digitization, this technique offers revolutionary enhancements in the performance of electronic converters. The paper starts with a fundamental-physics analysis of the time-wavelength transformation and the implication of time dilation on the signal-to-noise ratio. A detailed mathematical description of the time-stretch process is then constructed. It elucidates the influence of linear and nonlinear optical dispersion on the fidelity of the electrical signal. Design issues of a single-sideband time-stretch system, as they relate to broad-band operation, are examined. Problems arising from the nonuniform optical power spectral density are explained, and two methods for overcoming them are described.

However, it is difficult to maintain the correctness, consistency, and completeness of a fuzzy rule base constructed and tuned by a human expert. A reinforcement learning method is capable of learning the fuzzy rules automatically. However, it incurs a heavy learning phase and may result in an insufficiently learned rule base due to the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a neural fuzzy system with mixed coarse learning and fine learning phases. In the first phase, a supervised learning method is used to determine the membership functions for input and output variables simultaneously. After sufficient training, fine learning is applied which employs reinforcement learning algorithm to fine-tune the membership functions for output variables. For sufficient learning, a new learning method using a modification of Sutton and Barto's model is proposed to strengthen the exploration. Through this two-step tuning approach, the mobile robot is able to perform collision-free navigation. To deal with the difficulty of acquiring a large amount of training data with high consistency for supervised learning, we develop a virtual environment (VE) simulator, which is able to provide desktop virtual environment (DVE) and immersive virtual environment (IVE) visualization. Through operating a mobile robot in the virtual environment (DVE/IVE) by a skilled human operator, training data are readily obtained and used to train the neural fuzzy system.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2003.808179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167350","","Fuzzy control;Supervised learning;Virtual environment;Humans;Fuzzy systems;Mobile robots;Training data;Fuzzy logic;Learning systems;Navigation","learning (artificial intelligence);collision avoidance;mobile robots;fuzzy control;virtual reality;fuzzy set theory;neurocontrollers;intelligent control","fuzzy controller;supervised learning assisted reinforcement learning algorithm;obstacle avoidance;fuzzy logic system;fuzzy rule base;neural fuzzy system;mixed coarse/fine learning phases;membership functions;output variables;input variables;tuning;mobile robot;desktop virtual environment visualization;immersive virtual environment visualization;skilled human operator","","54","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An optical wireless communication system uses the atmosphere as a propagation medium. In order to provide line-of-sight (LOS), the transceivers are placed on high-rise buildings. However, dynamic wind loads, thermal expansion, and weak earthquakes cause buildings to sway. These sways require the designer to increase the transmitter beam divergence angle so as to maintain LOS between the transmitter and the receiver. It is clear that an overly wide divergence angle increases the required laser power, and, as a result, terminal cost and complexity increase. On the other hand, an overly narrow beam divergence angle may result in cutoff in communication when there is building sway. In this paper, we derive a mathematical model to minimize transmitter power and optimize transmitter gain (divergence angle) as a function of the building-sway statistics, the communication system parameters, and the required bit-error probability (BEP). Reduction in laser power could improve overall system performances and cost. For example, for BEP of 10/sup -9/, we can attain at least a 4-dB reduction of the required transmitter power in comparison to a system with both half and twice the optimum beam divergence angle.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2003.814351","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1210730","","Wireless communication;Optical transmitters;Optical receivers;Laser beams;Buildings;Laser beam cutting;Laser modes;Power lasers;Costs;Atmosphere","optical links;transceivers;laser beam applications;error statistics","urban optical wireless communication systems;last mile technology;line-of-sight;transceivers;high-rise buildings;dynamic wind loads;thermal expansion;weak earthquakes;transmitter beam divergence angle;LOS;laser power;terminal cost;building sway;transmitter power;transmitter gain;communication system parameters;bit-error probability","","98","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Also, the subjective improvement is significant in that the annoying boundary noise, common with the traditional Wiener filter, has been greatly suppressed. The second, and more substantial, part of this paper extends the AWA concept to the wavelet domain. The proposed AWA wavelet Wiener filter is superior to the traditional wavelet Wiener filter by about 0.5 dB (PSNR).

Proceedings.","","2003","2","","II","691","We question the role that large scale filter banks have traditionally played in texture classification. It is demonstrated that textures can be classified using the joint distribution of intensity values over extremely compact neighborhoods (starting from as small as 3 /spl times/ 3 pixels square), and that this outperforms classification using filter banks with large support. We develop a novel texton based representation, which is suited to modeling this joint neighborhood distribution for MRFs. The representation is learnt from training images, and then used to classify novel images (with unknown viewpoint and lighting) into texture classes. The power of the method is demonstrated by classifying over 2800 images of all 61 textures present in the Columbia-Utrecht database. The classification performance surpasses that of recent state-of-the-art filter bank based classifiers such as Leung & Malik, Cula & Dana, and Varma & Zisserman.","1063-6919","0-7695-1900-8","10.1109/CVPR.2003.1211534","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1211534","","Channel bank filters;Filter bank;Large-scale systems;Robots;Image databases;Shape;Computer vision;Histograms;Image segmentation;Markov random fields","image texture;image classification;probability;image representation;spatial filters;visual databases","texture classification;filter bank;joint distribution;intensity value;compact neighborhood;texton based representation;joint neighborhood distribution modeling;MRF;training image;viewpoint;lighting;Columbia-Utrecht database;classification performance;classifier","","181","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The tuners operate in the 10-20 GHz frequency range and have stubs that consist of a digital capacitor bank. Each bank has a predetermined number of capacitors that can be selected through the activation of appropriate MEMS switches. The value and number of capacitors is dictated by the range of loads that needs to be matched. Simulated and measured results from several designs are presented. A 4 bit /spl times/ 4 bit tuner that can match loads with 1.5 /spl Omega/<Re{Z/sub L/}<109 /spl Omega/ and -107 /spl Omega/<Im{Z/sub L/}<48 /spl Omega/ at 20 GHz equivalent to three quadrants of the Smith chart and loads with 3 /spl Omega/<Re{Z/sub L/}<94 /spl Omega/ and -260 /spl Omega/<Im{Z/sub L/}<91 /spl Omega/ at 10 GHz is demonstrated for the first time, as well as other designs. The demonstrated tuners provide real-time reconfiguration and matching for RF loads that change values during system operation. Applications include the development of several novel highly integrated microwave/millimeter-wave circuits such as ultra-wide-band high output power and increased power-added-efficiency amplifiers, ultra-wide-band multipliers, and very broad-band antenna arrays.

The architecture consists of a mobile platform connected to the base by three identical kinematic chains using five-bar linkages. Recent investigations showed that parallel mechanisms with such a topology for the legs can be efficiently statically balanced using only light elastic elements. This paper follows up with a workspace analysis and optimization of the design of that parallel mechanism. More specifically, considering a possible industrial application of the architecture as a positioning and orienting device of heavy loads, an optimization procedure for the maximization of the volume of the three-dimensional (3-D) constant-orientation workspace of the mechanism is first presented. As the mechanism could also have great potential as a motion base for flight simulators, we develop here a discretization method for the computation and graphical representation of a new workspace with coupled translational and rotational DOFs. This workspace can be defined as the 3-D space which can be obtained when generalized coordinates x,y and torsion angle /spl psi/ in the tilt-and-torsion angles parametrization are constant. A second procedure is then presented for the maximization of the volume of this second subset of the complete workspace.

A new feature of the formulation lies in the treatment of security issues. Different from existing formulations, we directly take into account the expected cost for voltage collapse and corrective controls, where the control effects by the devices to be installed are evaluated together with the other controls such as load shedding in contingencies to compute an optimal VAr planning. The inclusion of load shedding into the formulation guarantees the feasibility of the problem. The optimal allocation by the proposed method implies that the investment is optimized, taking into account its effects on security in terms of the cost for power system operation under possible events occurring probabilistically. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem of a large dimension. The Benders decomposition technique is tested where the original problem is decomposed into multiple subproblems. The numerical examinations are carried out using AEP-14 bus system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2002.804921","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1178747","","Power system security;Reactive power;Power system planning;Optimal control;Voltage control;Flexible AC transmission systems;Cost function;Investments;Optimization methods;Testing","flexible AC transmission systems;power system security;power system dynamic stability;power system analysis computing;power transmission planning;load shedding;reactive power;integer programming;nonlinear programming","reactive power planning;flexible AC transmission systems;FACTS;voltage collapse;corrective controls;load shedding;optimal VAr planning;mixed integer nonlinear programming;Benders decomposition technique;AEP-14 bus system;computer simulation","","132","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The simulation includes an adequate model of the transmission line, while also taking account of other factors such as the frequency dependence of the line parameters, models of wooden-porcelain insulation, wooden, and metallic towers and grounding systems including their impulse resistance characteristics. An impulse corona model (described elsewhere) is used, which, together with an adequate presentation of the flashover mechanism appropriate to air/porcelain insulation, allows one not only to predict the crest value of the overvoltages throughout the line, but also to assess accurately the real impact on the line fittings and substation equipment of the lightning surge travelling over the line. All the models are thoroughly verified by an extensive comparison of the simulated results with experiments by previous authors. Practical recommendations based on the simulations are made for an improvement in the lightning performance of a typical 110 kV transmission line.","1350-2360","","10.1049/ip-gtd:20030252","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1214570","","","power overhead lines;EMTP;lightning;flashover;corona;poles and towers;earthing;electric resistance;surges;insulators;power engineering computing;lightning protection","EMTP analysis;lightning performance;HV transmission line;simulation;digital model;ATP-EMTP program;MODELS-feature;unshielded overhead line;direct lightning stroke;frequency dependence;wooden-porcelain insulation;metallic towers;wooden towers;grounding systems;impulse resistance characteristics;impulse corona model;flashover mechanism;crest value prediction;line fittings;substation equipment;lightning surge;110 kV","","21","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals"

This model represents the hysteresis phenomenon by a combination of a nonlinear stiffness component and a nonlinear damping component leading to a mathematically well-posed nonlinear differential equation. The parameters of the model are identified using optimization techniques.

It has a bidirectional power flow capability, controllable displacement power factor and lower harmonic distortion at both variable speed source and fixed frequency utility. Further, asynchronous or synchronous PWM can be employed depending on the frequency modulation ratio in the primary side converter and it guarantees full input voltage utilization for DC-link and near symmetric square wave pulse trains applied to high frequency transformer regardless of varying input frequency.

Portable operation, however, limits the amount of power and vacuum levels that can be employed in the plasma source. This paper describes the design and initial characterization of a low-power microwave plasma source based on a microstrip split-ring resonator that is capable of operating at pressures from 0.05 torr (6.7 Pa) up to one atmosphere. The plasma source's microstrip resonator operates at 900 MHz and presents a quality factor of Q=335. Argon and air discharges can be self-started with less than 3 W in a relatively wide pressure range.

Applications of principal component analysis (PCA) in image processing are numerous, and the proposed tools aim to give material for color image processing, that take into account their particular nature. For this purpose, we use the quaternion model for color images and introduce the extension of two classical techniques to their quaternionic case: singular value decomposition (SVD) and Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT). For the quaternionic version of the KLT, we also introduce the problem of eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of a quaternion matrix. We give the properties of these quaternion tools for color images and present their behavior on natural images. We also present a method to compute the decompositions using complex matrix algebra.

In particular, conventional linear estimators are not adaptive to variations of the operating point. The sliding mode technique has shown promising results when estimating or controlling nonlinear systems. This paper presents a sliding mode observer (SMO) for estimating the position and speed of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) to achieve sensorless drive system. The technique can be generalized to other motor drives and motion control systems. The effects of the variation of motor parameters such as stator resistance and stator inductance on the position and/or speed estimations, over a wide speed range, have been studied.

The analysed permanent magnetic gear has a gear ratio of 5.5 and is able to deliver 27 Nm. The analysis has shown that special attention needs to be paid to the system where the gear is to be installed because of a low natural torsion spring constant. The analysed gear was also constructed in practice in order to validate the analysis and predict the efficiency. The measured torque from the magnetic gear was only 16 Nm reduced by the large end-effects. A systematic analysis of the loss components in the magnetic gear is also performed in order to figure out why the efficiency for the actual construction was only 81%. A large magnetic loss component originated in the bearings, where an unplanned extra bearing was necessary due to mechanical problems. Without the losses of magnetic origin in the bearings and less end-effects caused by relatively short stack, an impressive efficiency estimated at 96% can be obtained. Comparison with classical mechanical gears have shown that the magnetic gear has a better efficiency and a comparable torque per volume density. Finally it is concluded that the result in this paper may help to initiate a shift from mechanical gears to magnetic gears.","","0-7803-7883-0","10.1109/IAS.2003.1257784","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1257784","","Gears;Magnetic flux;Permanent magnets;Magnetic analysis;Magnetic levitation;Torque;Couplings;Topology;Magnetic losses;Shafts","gears;magnetic devices;permanent magnets;torque measurement;losses;finite element analysis","high performance magnetic gear;permanent magnetic gear;gear ratio;low natural torsion spring constant;efficiency prediction;torque measurement;large end-effects;loss components analysis;torque per volume density;finite element analysis","","23","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Eng., California Univ., Riverside, CA, USA; NA; NA","30th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture, 2003. Proceedings.","","2003","","","136","146","Energy consumption is a major concern in many embedded computing systems. Several studies have shown that cache memories account for about 50% of the total energy consumed in these systems. The performance of a given cache architecture is largely determined by the behavior of the application using that cache. Desktop systems have to accommodate a very wide range of applications and therefore the manufacturer usually sets the cache architecture as a compromise given current applications, technology and cost. Unlike desktop systems, embedded systems are designed to run a small range of well-defined applications. In this context, a cache architecture that is tuned for that narrow range of applications can have both increased performance as well as lower energy consumption. We introduce a novel cache architecture intended for embedded microprocessor platforms. The cache can be configured by software to be direct-mapped, two-way, or four-way set associative, using a technique we call way concatenation, having very little size or performance overhead. We show that the proposed cache architecture reduces energy caused by dynamic power compared to a way-shutdown cache. Furthermore, we extend the cache architecture to also support a way shutdown method designed to reduce the energy from static power that is increasing in importance in newer CMOS technologies. Our study of 23 programs drawn from Powerstone, MediaBench and Spec2000 show that tuning the cache's configuration saves energy for every program compared to conventional four-way set-associative as well as direct mapped caches, with average savings of 40% compared to a four-way conventional cache.","1063-6897","0-7695-1945-8","10.1109/ISCA.2003.1206995","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1206995","","Embedded system;Computer architecture;Energy consumption;Application software;CMOS technology;Embedded computing;Cache memory;Manufacturing;Costs;Microprocessors","cache storage;power consumption;embedded systems;microcomputers;CMOS memory circuits;microprocessor chips;memory architecture","configurable cache architecture;embedded systems;desktop systems;CMOS technology;low energy consumption;embedded microprocessor platform;way concatenation technique;way shutdown method;four-way set associative cache;direct-mapped cache;Powerstone;MediaBench;Spec2000","","29","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Without a priori knowledge, the recurrent neuro-fuzzy system is first trained to model the inverse dynamics of the AUV and then utilized as a feedforward controller to compute the nominal torque of the AUV along a desired trajectory. The PD feedback controller computes the error torque to minimize the system error along the desired trajectory. This error torque also provides an error signal for online updating the parameters in the recurrent neuro-fuzzy control to adapt in a changing environment. A systematic self-adaptive learning algorithm, consisting of a mapping-constrained agglomerative clustering algorithm for the structure learning and a recursive recurrent learning algorithm for the parameter learning, has been developed to construct the recurrent neuro-fuzzy system to model the inverse dynamics of an AUV with fast learning convergence. Computer simulations of the proposed recurrent neuro-fuzzy control scheme and its performance comparison with some existing controllers have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","2374-958X","","10.1109/TRA.2003.808865","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1192158","","Underwater vehicles;Proportional control;Error correction;Clustering algorithms;PD control;Adaptive control;Fuzzy neural networks;Inverse problems;Vehicle dynamics;Torque control","recurrent neural nets;remotely operated vehicles;underwater vehicles;adaptive control;digital simulation","self-adaptive recurrent neuro-fuzzy control;autonomous underwater vehicle;feedforward controller;proportional-plus-derivative control;feedback controller;unstructured environment;inverse dynamics;computer simulations;recursive recurrent learning algorithm","","95","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Eng., Ohio State Univ., Columbus, OH, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","","2003","49","5","1097","1119","A universal framework is developed for constructing full-rate and full-diversity coherent space-time codes for systems with arbitrary numbers of transmit and receive antennas. The proposed framework combines space-time layering concepts with algebraic component codes optimized for single-input-single-output (SISO) channels. Each component code is assigned to a ""thread"" in the space-time matrix, allowing it thus full access to the channel spatial diversity in the absence of the other threads. Diophantine approximation theory is then used in order to make the different threads ""transparent"" to each other. Within this framework, a special class of signals which uses algebraic number-theoretic constellations as component codes is thoroughly investigated. The lattice structure of the proposed number-theoretic codes along with their minimal delay allow for polynomial complexity maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding using algorithms from lattice theory. Combining the design framework with the Cayley transform allows to construct full diversity differential and noncoherent space-time codes. The proposed framework subsumes many of the existing codes in the literature, extends naturally to time-selective and frequency-selective channels, and allows for more flexibility in the tradeoff between power efficiency, bandwidth efficiency, and receiver complexity. Simulation results that demonstrate the significant gains offered by the proposed codes are presented in certain representative scenarios.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2003.810644","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1197844","","Diversity reception;Space time codes;Lattices;Receiving antennas;Approximation methods;Constellation diagram;Delay;Maximum likelihood decoding;Frequency","space-time codes;maximum likelihood decoding;algebraic codes;receiving antennas;transmitting antennas;number theory;telecommunication channels;approximation theory;diversity reception","universal space-time coding;full-diversity coherent space-time codes;full-rate coherent space-time codes;transmit antennas;receive antennas;space-time layering;algebraic component codes;single-input-single-output channels;SISO channels;space-time matrix;spatial diversity;Diophantine approximation theory;algebraic number-theoretic constellations;lattice structure;number-theoretic codes;minimal delay;polynomial complexity maximum-likelihood decoding;lattice theory;Cayley transform;full diversity differential space-time codes;noncoherent space-time codes;time-selective channels;frequency-selective channels;power efficiency;bandwidth efficiency;receiver complexity;simulation results","","343","","62","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is defined as the modeling, analysis, and control of systems that involve the interaction of both discrete state systems, represented by finite automata, and continuous state dynamics, represented by differential equations. The embedded autopilot of a modern commercial jet is a prime example of a hybrid system: the autopilot modes correspond to the application of different control laws, and the logic of mode switching is determined by the continuous state dynamics of the aircraft, as well as through interaction with the pilot. To understand the behavior of hybrid systems, to simulate, and to control these systems, theoretical advances, analyses, and numerical tools are needed. In this paper, we first present a general model for a hybrid system along with an overview of methods for verifying continuous and hybrid systems. We describe a particular verification technique for hybrid systems, based on two-person zero-sum game theory for automata and continuous dynamical systems. We then outline a numerical implementation of this technique using level set methods, and we demonstrate its use in the design and analysis of aircraft collision avoidance protocols and in verification of autopilot logic.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2003.814621","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1215682","","Control system synthesis;Automatic control;Automata;Aircraft;Control theory;Computer science;Control system analysis;Differential equations;Control systems;Logic","system theory;reachability analysis;collision avoidance;formal verification;aircraft control;game theory;automata theory","hybrid system theory;control theory;computer science verification;reachability;hybrid systems;verification;discrete state systems;aircraft collision avoidance protocols;autopilot logic;two-person zero-sum game;automata;continuous dynamical systems","","213","","82","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Toward this end, we propose a variational level set framework that can account for global shape consistency as well as for local deformations. In order to improve performance, the problems of segmentation and tracking of the structure of interest are dealt with simultaneously by introducing the notion of time in the process and looking for a solution that satisfies that prior constraints while being consistent along consecutive frames.

The authors compare and contrast the lean and Six Sigma approaches, and find that greater benefits can be reaped by blending the best of each.","0956-9944","","10.1049/me:20030203","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1199793","","","supply chain management;production control;quality management;statistical process control","lean production strategy;Six Sigma business strategy;lean Sigma;cycle times reduction;inventories reduction;set up times reduction;production control;quality management;statistical process control;equipment downtime reduction;scrap reduction;rework reduction;hidden factory;value;supply chain","","6","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals"

These devices will increasingly be networked, thus enabling the construction of distributed applications that have to adapt to changes in context, such as variations in network bandwidth, battery power, connectivity, reachability of services and hosts, etc. In this paper, we describe CARISMA, a mobile computing middleware which exploits the principle of reflection to enhance the construction of adaptive and context-aware mobile applications. The middleware provides software engineers with primitives to describe how context changes should be handled using policies. These policies may conflict. We classify the different types of conflicts that may arise in mobile computing and argue that conflicts cannot be resolved statically at the time applications are designed, but, rather, need to be resolved at execution time. We demonstrate a method by which policy conflicts can be handled; this method uses a microeconomic approach that relies on a particular type of sealed-bid auction. We describe how this method is implemented in the CARISMA middleware architecture and sketch a distributed context-aware application for mobile devices to illustrate how the method works in practice. We show, by way of a systematic performance evaluation, that conflict resolution does not imply undue overheads, before comparing our research to related work and concluding the paper.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2003.1237173","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1237173","","Middleware;Mobile computing;Application software;Mobile handsets;Personal digital assistants;Context-aware services;Bandwidth;Batteries;Power engineering computing;Reflection","middleware;mobile computing;game theory;quality of service","CARISMA;middleware;personal digital assistants;mobile phones;mobile computing;context awareness;game theory;conflict resolution","","276","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The systems that comprise this infrastructure also are full of boundaries and interfaces where humans and systems must interact: most secure systems exist to serve human users and carry out human-oriented processes, and are designed and built by humans. From the perspective of the human-computer interaction (HCO community), many of these interfaces do not reflect good thinking on how to make them easy to use in a manner that results in security. From the perspective of the security community, many widespread security problems arguably might stem from bad interaction between humans and systems. I recently attended a workshop (ACM/CHI 2003 Workshop on Human-Computer Interaction and Security Systems) that tried to bring together these communities to trigger further inquiry into this area. In this article, I want to discuss the workshop and how the thinking there applies to the secure systems topic this department addresses.","1558-4046","","10.1109/MSECP.2003.1203228","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1203228","","Computer security;Cryptography;Human computer interaction;Pervasive computing;Multilevel systems;Guidelines;Privacy;Process design;Councils;History","security of data;man-machine systems;human factors;cryptography","security vulnerabilities;secure systems;human-oriented processes;human-computer interaction","","29","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

As software systems evolve, those diagrams undergo changes to, for instance, correct errors or address changes in the requirements. Those changes can in turn lead to subsequent changes to other elements in the UML diagrams. Impact analysis is then defined as the process of identifying the potential consequences (side-effects) of a change, and estimating what needs to be modified to accomplish a change. In this article, we propose a UML model-based approach to impact analysis that can be applied before any implementation of the changes, thus allowing an early decision-making and change planning process. We first verify that the UML diagrams are consistent (consistency check). Then changes between two different versions of a UML model are identified according to a change taxonomy, and model elements that are directly or indirectly impacted by those changes (i.e., may undergo changes) are determined using formally defined impact analysis rules (written with Object Constraint Language). A measure of distance between a changed element and potentially impacted elements is also proposed to prioritize the results of impact analysis according to their likelihood of occurrence. We also present a prototype tool that provides automated support for our impact analysis strategy, that we then apply on a case study to validate both the implementation and methodology.","1063-6773","0-7695-1905-9","10.1109/ICSM.2003.1235428","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1235428","","Unified modeling language;Design engineering;Systems engineering and theory;Software systems;Decision making;Costs;Performance analysis;Software quality;Laboratories;Computer errors","specification languages;software maintenance;formal specification;software development management;object-oriented programming","impact analysis;change management;UML models;Unified Modeling Language;UML analysis;UML design;UML diagrams;software evolution;potential consequences;decision-making;planning process;consistency check;change taxonomy;Object Constraint Language;prototype tool;automated support","","72","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The most notable barriers to the use of ICT in education are allocation of proper funds, level of teacher knowledge, government policies, and the gap between the various sections of society.

Automated detection and quantitation of abnormal vascular tortuosity from three-dimensional (3-D) medical image data would, therefore, be of value. However, previous research has centered primarily upon two-dimensional (2-D) analysis of the special subset of vessels whose paths are normally close to straight. This report provides the first 3-D tortuosity analysis of clusters of vessels within the normally tortuous intracerebral circulation. We define three different clinical patterns of abnormal tortuosity. We extend into 3-D two tortuosity metrics previously reported as useful in analyzing 2-D images and describe a new metric that incorporates counts of minima of total curvature. We extract vessels from MRA data, map corresponding anatomical regions between sets of normal patients and patients with known pathology, and evaluate the three tortuosity metrics for ability to detect each type of abnormality within the region of interest. We conclude that the new tortuosity metric appears to be the most effective in detecting several types of abnormalities. However, one of the other metrics, based on a sum of curvature magnitudes, may be more effective in recognizing tightly coiled, ""corkscrew"" vessels associated with malignant tumors.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2003.816964","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1225850","","Diseases;Biomedical imaging;Two dimensional displays;Image analysis;Malignant tumors;Shape measurement;Associate members;Image recognition;Medical diagnostic imaging;Data mining","blood vessels;biomedical MRI;image segmentation;brain;tumours","intracerebral vasculature;MRA images;magnetic resonance angiography;two-dimensional analysis;sum of curvature magnitudes;tightly coiled corkscrew vessels;patients with known pathology;region of interest;malignant tumors","Brain;Brain;Brain Neoplasms;Brain Neoplasms;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebrovascular Circulation;Cerebrovascular Disorders;Cerebrovascular Disorders;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Neovascularization, Pathologic;Neovascularization, Pathologic;Predictive Value of Tests;Severity of Illness Index","198","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, primal sketch priors (e.g., edges, ridges and corners) are constructed and used to enhance the quality of the hallucinated high resolution image. Moreover, a contour smoothness constraint enforces consistency of primitives in the hallucinated image by a Markov-chain based inference algorithm.

Defense against these attacks is complicated by spoofed source IP addresses, which make it difficult to determine a packet's true origin. We propose Pi (short for path identifier), a new packet marking approach in which a path fingerprint is embedded in each packet, enabling a victim to identify packets traversing the same paths through the Internet on a per packet basis, regardless of source IP address spoofing. Pi features many unique properties. It is a per-packet deterministic mechanism: each packet traveling along the same path carries the same identifier This allows the victim to take a proactive role in defending against a DDoS attack by using the Pi mark to filter out packets matching the attackers' identifiers on a per packet basis. The Pi scheme performs well under large-scale DDoS attacks consisting of thousands of attackers, and is effective even when only half the routers in the Internet participate in packet marking. Pi marking and filtering are both extremely lightweight and require negligible state. We use traceroute maps of real Internet topologies (e.g. CAIDA's Skitter (2000) and Burch and Cheswick's Internet Map (1999, 2002)) to simulate DDoS attacks and validate our design.","1081-6011","0-7695-1940-7","10.1109/SECPRI.2003.1199330","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1199330","","Computer crime;Information filtering;Information filters;Web and internet services;Web server;Fingerprint recognition;Matched filters;Large-scale systems;Topology;Internet telephony","Internet;network operating systems;invasive software;authorisation;computer network management","Pi;operating systems;path identification mechanism;DDoS attacks;Distributed denial of service;spoofed source IP addresses;packet marking;path fingerprint embedding;per-packet deterministic mechanism;traceroute maps;Internet topologies;CAIDA Skitter;Internet Map","","184","","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper analyzes the jitter-dependent behavior of the tracked oversampling clock-recovery loop, by introducing the concept of effective phase detector gain. Three methods to stabilize the loop bandwidth against jitter variation are described and compared: adapting the loop gain, increasing the oversampling ratio, and adjusting the sampling points. The analyses are then verified with the jitter transfer characteristics obtained from time-step behavioral simulation.","1558-125X","","10.1109/TCSII.2003.819070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1246355","","Jitter;Clocks;Timing;Phase detection;Bandwidth;Detectors;Error correction;Sampling methods;Robustness;Feedback loop","transceivers;phase detectors;synchronisation;voltage-controlled oscillators;phase locked loops;CMOS analogue integrated circuits","effective phase detector gain;tracked oversampling;multigigabit clock and data recovery;jitter transfer analysis;inconsistent loop dynamics;oversampling ratio;time-step behavioral simulation;nonlinear clock-recovery loops;linear control theory;voltage-controlled oscillator","","34","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The paper discusses two types of filters: band pass filters and damped filters, which are commonly applied. The operation of these filters is described with respect to the design and system limitations. The operating constraints are then superimposed. The development of this approach shows that there are design limitations and large system changes or modifications can result in higher distortion or even damage to filters in extreme cases. The constraints and limitations that a designer faces in implementing an effective filter design with modern tools of harmonic analysis, measurements and system analysis are discussed.

Accelerated testing is very expensive and can last a long time, so that such experiments must be optimized. In addition, thermomechanical behavior of the assembly under realistic operating conditions for long times can be studied in shorter times thanks to finite element simulations. Non-linear finite element simulations have been carried out to make a correlation between accelerated aging tests and real operation. Stress-strain history under representative thermal loading has been determined in both cases. The energy dissipated in solder joints has been calculated and has been used as an estimator of the damage in the solder joint.

Using the technique, device designers can set and choose the process conditions of the device's critical layers to yield a manufacturable process prior to actual device layout, and therefore preserves the ability for layout design optimization independent of process optimization.

This paper models saturation and end effects in linear PM motors using magnetic circuit models. The saturating parts of the magnetic circuit are modeled as nonlinear reluctances. Magnetomotive forces represent the currents and the magnets. This paper shows that when saturated, a negative d-axis current increases the force developed by the motor. Although the increase is not large, it is nevertheless useful, because a negative d-axis current also results in a decrease in the amplifier rating. Further, the trajectory for the maximum force-to-current ratio is derived.

Because no real resistor is used, the efficiency of the converters is not sacrificed. The required additional sensor and implementation of the virtual resistor in the control algorithm is strongly influenced on how the virtual resistor is connected to the LC filter.

The main disadvantage of near-infrared (NIR) tomography lies in the low spatial resolution resulting from the highly scattering nature of tissue for these wavelengths. MRI has achieved high resolution, but suffers from low specificity. In this study, NIR image reconstruction algorithms that incorporate a priori structural information provided by MRI are investigated in an attempt to optimize recovery of a simulated optical property distribution. The effect of high levels of tissue heterogeneity are evaluated to determine the limitations of incorporating prior information into a realistic set of patient breast images. We assume absorption coefficient (μa) variations near ±40%, and transport scattering coefficient (μ/sub s//sup //) variations near ±20%, in a coronal breast MRI geometry. Changes in tissue pathology due to tumor growth can be observed with NIR tompgraphy, and so the goal here is to determine how best to quantify these tumor-based contrast regions within the presence of high tissue heterogeneity. By applying knowledge of tissue's layered structure in reconstruction through various constraints in the iterative algorithm, quantitative recovery of the tumor optical properties improves from 69% to 74%, and localization improves as well. However, only when the true heterogeneity of the tissue distribution was included was accurate quantification of the tumor region possible. Using a good initial guess of μa and μ/sub s//sup //, derived from the regional structure of the model, quantification of the region reaches 99% of the true value, and spatial resolution retains a similar value to the original MRI image.","1558-4542","","10.1109/JSTQE.2003.813304","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1238976","","Image reconstruction;Tomography;Breast;Magnetic resonance imaging;Optical scattering;Spatial resolution;Neoplasms;Magnetic resonance;High-resolution imaging;Optical imaging","biomedical optical imaging;infrared imaging;optical tomography;biomedical MRI;image reconstruction;medical image processing;image resolution;biological tissues;mammography;biological organs;tumours","NIR tomography breast image reconstruction;a priori structural information;algorithm development;combined MRI-NIR imaging modality;near-infrared imaging;high resolution maps;optical properties;noninvasive simultaneous measurement;low spatial resolution;highly scattering nature;low specificity;simulated optical property distribution;tissue heterogeneity;absorption coefficient variations;transport scattering coefficient variations;coronal breast MRI geometry;tissue pathology;tumor growth;tumor-based contrast regions;layered structure;iterative algorithm;localization;accurate quantification;regional structure;spatial resolution","","104","","62","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The objective of this study was to develop a computer-aided system that will facilitate the characterization of carotid plaques for the identification of individuals with asymptomatic carotid stenosis at risk of stroke. A total of 230 plaque images were collected which were classified into two types: symptomatic because of ipsilateral hemispheric symptoms, or asymptomatic because they were not connected with ipsilateral hemispheric events. Ten different texture feature sets were extracted from the manually segmented plaque images using the following algorithms: first-order statistics, spatial gray level dependence matrices, gray level difference statistics, neighborhood gray tone difference matrix, statistical feature matrix, Laws texture energy measures, fractal dimension texture analysis, Fourier power spectrum and shape parameters. For the classification task a modular neural network composed of self-organizing map (SOM) classifiers, and combining techniques based on a confidence measure were used. Combining the classification results of the ten SOM classifiers inputted with the ten feature sets improved the classification rate of the individual classifiers, reaching an average diagnostic yield (DY) of 73.1%. The same modular system was implemented using the statistical k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier. The combined DY for the KNN system was 68.8%. The results of this paper show that it is possible to identify a group of patients at risk of stroke based on texture features extracted from ultrasound images of carotid plaques.

A numerical prediction of EMI/EMC has the potential to evaluate EMI performances at the design stage and before prototyping. It can also help reduce the post-prototype EMC cost by minimizing late re-design and modifications of a drive implementation. This paper describes a systematic approach towards early EMI prediction of motor drives. It is able to calculate the conducted EMI through modeling of parasitic coupling and circuit simulation. Methodologies for extracting parasitic parameters of major EMI components of a PM motor drive are developed using FEM analysis, experimental measurement and analytical approximation. Major EMI characteristics of the PM motor drive is then predicted by using a circuit simulator to solve the motor drive circuitry with high frequency parasitic parameters. Simulation results are compared with experimental data and the effectiveness of the EMI simulation approach is demonstrated.","","0-7803-7768-0","10.1109/APEC.2003.1179170","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1179170","","Electromagnetic interference;Motor drives;Automotive applications;Electromagnetic compatibility;Circuit simulation;Technological innovation;Automobiles;Electric motors;Electromagnetic compatibility and interference;Performance evaluation","permanent magnet motors;automobiles;electromagnetic interference;electromagnetic compatibility;finite element analysis;brushless DC motors;DC motor drives;invertors;circuit simulation;power MOSFET","EMI prediction;PM motor drive;automotive applications;technology innovations;automobiles;electromagnetic interference;EMI;electromagnetic compatibility;EMC;numerical prediction;conducted EMI calculation;parasitic coupling;circuit simulation;parasitic parameters;FEM analysis;circuit simulator;high frequency parasitic parameters;EMI simulation;three-phase MOSFET inverter;parasitic parameter extraction","","34","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the main purposes of homecare telemedicine is to develop a wireless, low-cost and use-friendly system which allows patients to measure their own vital signs, such as blood pressure and electrocardiogram (ECG), and provide the health care professionals with the facility to remotely monitor the patient's vital signs quickly and easily. There were four major parts in developing the ECG-blood pressure homecare telemonitoring system. The first part involved the selection or designing of devices that measure the vital signs. An Omoron HEM-609 blood pressure monitor was used to acquire the patient's blood pressure. Since ECG machines or bedside monitors are expensive to use for this purpose, an ECG amplifier was custom designed and implemented using AD624AD to amplify the ECG signal. A PIC 16C774A microcontroller was then interfaced to the wearable blood pressure monitor and the ECG amplifier to collect the data from these devices, process them, store them and feed them to a transmitter. A high performance RF Module TXM-900-HP-II transmitter and receiver were then used to wirelessly transmit and receive the vital sign data from the microcontroller to a personal computer at the receiving site. An option was then built into the system to provide the facility to transmit the signals via internet. The final part involved development of a user-friendly graphical user interface using Visual Basic to receive the incoming patient data from the receiver, store them, process them and present them in a clinically meaningful fashion to the health care professionals.","1094-687X","0-7803-7789-3","10.1109/IEMBS.2003.1280812","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1280812","","Biomedical monitoring;Electrocardiography;Blood pressure;Patient monitoring;Medical services;Remote monitoring;Radiofrequency amplifiers;Microcontrollers;Transmitters;Telemedicine","blood pressure measurement;electrocardiography;microcontrollers;health care;telemedicine;patient monitoring;graphical user interfaces;visual languages;BASIC;medical signal detection","ECG-blood pressure homecare telemonitoring system;low-cost microcontroller-based wireless telemonitor;health care service;electrocardiogram;Omoron HEM-609 blood pressure monitor;ECG amplifier;wearable blood pressure monitor;high performance RF Module transmitter;user-friendly graphical user interface;Visual Basic","","18","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, pulse detection accuracy was evaluated by comparing the algorithm's pulse detections with reference ECG annotations using the MIT-BIH Polysomnographic Database. The algorithm detected 99.31% of the 368,364 beats annotated in the ECG. Second, the accuracy of pulse onset determination was established using a newly created, manually-edited reference ABP signal database.

The purpose of this problem is to design a linear filter such that, for all admissible parameter uncertainties and all possible incomplete observations, the error state of the filtering process is mean square bounded, and the steady-state variance of the estimation error of each state is not more than the individual prescribed upper bound. It is shown that, the addressed filtering problem can effectively be solved in terms of the solutions of a couple of algebraic Riccati-like inequalities or linear matrix inequalities.

This paper reviews transconductor design by focusing on the V-I kernel that determines the key transconductor properties. Based on bandwidth considerations, simple V-I kernels with few or no internal nodes are preferred. In a systematic way, virtually all simple kernels published in literature are generated. This is done in two steps: 1) basic 3-terminal transconductors are covered and 2) then five different techniques to combine two of them in a composite V-I kernel. In order to compare transconductors in a fair way, a normalized signal-to-noise ratio (NSNR) is defined. The basic V-I kernels and the five classes of composite V-I kernels are then compared, leading to insight in the key mechanisms that affect NSNR. Symbolic equations are derived to estimate NSNR, while simulations with more advanced MOSFET models verify the results. The results show a strong tradeoff between NSNR and transconductance tuning range. Resistively generated MOSFETs render the best NSNR results and are robust for future technology developments.","1558-125X","","10.1109/TCSII.2003.818393","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1237362","","Hafnium;Transconductors;Kernel;Filters;Oscillators;Bandwidth;Signal to noise ratio;Equations;MOSFET circuits;Transconductance","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;linearisation techniques;active filters;integrated circuit noise;radiofrequency filters;circuit tuning","HF CMOS transconductors;active elements;high-frequency filters;RF amplifiers;RF mixers;RF oscillators;transconductor design;composite V-I kernels;normalized SNR;normalized signal-to-noise ratio;symbolic equations;MOSFET models;transconductance tuning range;Gm-C filter;linearization;figure of merit;transconductor-C filter;tunable filter","","52","","46","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to lower the level of SNR required for successful detection, we propose an action potential detector based on a prudent combination of wavelet coefficients of multiple scales and demonstrate its performance for neural signal recording with varying degrees of similarity between signal and noise. The experimental data include recordings from the rat somatosensory cortex, the giant medial nerve of crayfish, and the cutaneous nerve of bullfrog. The proposed method was tested for various SNR values and degrees of spectral similarity. The method was superior to the Teager energy operator and even comparable to or better than the optimal linear detector.

"Log-polar wavelet energy signatures for rotation and scale invariant texture classification","Chi-Man Pun; Moon-Chuen Lee","Fac. of Sci. & Technol., Univ. of Macau, Macau; NA","IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","","2003","25","5","590","603","Classification of texture images is important in image analysis and classification. This paper proposes an effective scheme for rotation and scale invariant texture classification using log-polar wavelet signatures. The rotation and scale invariant feature extraction for a given image involves applying a log-polar transform to eliminate the rotation and scale effects, but at same time produce a row shifted log-polar image, which is then passed to an adaptive row shift invariant wavelet packet transform to eliminate the row shift effects. So, the output wavelet coefficients are rotation and scale invariant. The adaptive row shift invariant wavelet packet transform is quite efficient with only O(n /spl middot/ log n) complexity. A feature vector of the most dominant log-polar wavelet energy signatures extracted from each subband of wavelet coefficients is constructed for rotation and scale invariant texture classification. In the experiments, we employed a Mahalanobis classifier to classify a set of 25 distinct natural textures selected from the Brodatz album. The experimental results, based on different testing data sets for images with different orientations and scales, show that the proposed classification scheme using log-polar wavelet signatures outperforms two other texture classification methods, its overall accuracy rate for joint rotation and scale invariance being 90.8 percent, demonstrating that the extracted energy signatures are effective rotation and scale invariant features. Concerning its robustness to noise, the classification scheme also performs better than the other methods.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2003.1195993","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1195993","","Image texture analysis;Wavelet transforms;Wavelet packets;Wavelet analysis;Gabor filters;Feature extraction;Wavelet coefficients;Data mining;Image segmentation;Markov random fields","image texture;image classification;wavelet transforms;computational complexity;noise","log-polar wavelet energy signatures;rotation invariant texture classification;scale invariant texture classification;texture image classification;image analysis;log-polar transform;adaptive row shift invariant wavelet packet transform;complexity;dominant log-polar wavelet energy signatures;wavelet coefficient subbands;Mahalanobis classifier;Brodatz album;noise robustness","","171","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

They are weak single-phase networks often loaded with severely distorting SCR-based locomotive drives which continually change their point of physical connection to the network. For a public distribution system the total harmonic distortion is a clear measure of supply quality. However, for a traction system the more important parameter is the voltage form factor, which is directly related to the maximum power a locomotive can deliver. To minimize this form factor, this paper proposes the use of a shunt active filter that minimizes the third, fifth, and seventh harmonic voltage components at the point of filter coupling. It is shown that the filter is effective in both compensating the pantograph voltage form factor, and providing reactive power to maintain the feeder voltage.

"Active front-end converter for medium-voltage current-source drives using sequential-sampling synchronous space-vector modulation","E. P. Wiechmann; R. P. Burgos; J. Holtz","Dept. of Electr. Eng., Concepcion Univ., Chile; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","","2003","50","6","1275","1289","This paper presents an active front-end converter for medium-voltage current-source drives. It comprises two series-connected pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) rectifiers fed from a delta-wye isolation transformer. These employ sequential-sampling synchronous space-vector modulation (SVM), and operate at a switching frequency of 100 Hz, thus reducing the switching losses by 66% compared to previous PWM approaches. Digital processing requirements of this technique are minimized by using decision-making SVM. This online modulation technique ensures full harmonic current cancellation through the magnetic interface, and minimizes the sampling/control-action delay. Therefore it enables the use of advanced control strategies notwithstanding the low sampling frequency of the control system. Exploiting this fact, the proposed converter is controlled using a nonlinear strategy in the synchronous frame. The strategy employs input-output and feedback linearization, and is derived from the complex-signal flow diagram of the converter. The proposed strategy linearizes and partially decouples the converter d-q-axes dynamics, ensuring a dynamic response totally independent from the operating point, even under regeneration. This is a highly desirable feature for high-performance drives presenting continuous transitions from motoring to regeneration. Moreover, the converter presents an independent active and reactive power flow, which enables it to operate as a reactive power compensator if desired.

Proceedings.","","2003","1","","I","I","Shape-from-silhouette (SFS), also known as visual hull (VH) construction, is a popular 3D reconstruction method, which estimates the shape of an object from multiple silhouette images. The original SFS formulation assumes that the entire silhouette images are captured either at the same time or while the object is static. This assumption is violated when the object moves or changes shape. Hence the use of SFS with moving objects has been restricted to treating each time instant sequentially and independently. Recently we have successfully extended the traditional SFS formulation to refine the shape of a rigidly moving object over time. We further extend SFS to apply to dynamic articulated objects. Given silhouettes of a moving articulated object, the process of recovering the shape and motion requires two steps: (1) correctly segmenting (points on the boundary of) the silhouettes to each articulated part of the object, (2) estimating the motion of each individual part using the segmented silhouette. In this paper, we propose an iterative algorithm to solve this simultaneous assignment and alignment problem. Once we have estimated the shape and motion of each part of the object, the articulation points between each pair of rigid parts are obtained by solving a simple motion constraint between the connected parts. To validate our algorithm, we first apply it to segment the different body parts and estimate the joint positions of a person. The acquired kinematic (shape and joint) information is then used to track the motion of the person in new video sequences.","1063-6919","0-7695-1900-8","10.1109/CVPR.2003.1211340","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1211340","","Humans;Kinematics;Motion estimation;Shape;Image segmentation;Iterative algorithms;Surface treatment;Robots;Reconstruction algorithms;Tracking","motion estimation;edge detection;video signal processing;iterative methods;stereo image processing;optical tracking;object detection;kinematics;image segmentation;image sequences;image reconstruction","shape-from-silhouette;human body kinematics estimation;motion estimation;motion capture;visual hull construction;3D reconstruction;object shape estimation;multiple silhouette images;dynamic articulated object;moving articulated object;shape recovery;motion recovery;silhouette image segmentation;iterative algorithm;joint position estimation;motion tracking;video sequence","","153","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Biped locomotion involves sudden transition from one support surface to another during every step. Therefore, control of legged locomotion, particularly stability, is difficult. We have discussed in detail the various strategies that are available to maintain balance during locomotion. Control of stability and hence locomotion is facilitated by the interplay between various strategies during adaptive locomotion. Sensory information from the three modalities (visual, vestibular, and kinesthetic inputs), knowledge, and prior experience all play a critical role in the control of dynamic stability. While much is known, many details remain to be filled in to complete our understanding of how dynamic stability is maintained during locomotion.","1937-4186","","10.1109/MEMB.2003.1195695","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1195695","","Stability;Humans;Predictive control;Foot;Feedforward systems;Legged locomotion;Hip;Temperature control;Biological control systems;Shape control","biocontrol;adaptive control;biomechanics;mechanoception;predictive control;mechanical stability;legged locomotion;vision;muscle;feedforward","adaptive human locomotion;dynamic stability strategies;complex environments;biped locomotion;support surface;step;legged locomotion control;sensory information;kinesthetic input;vestibular input;visual input;feed-forward control","Adaptation, Physiological;Foot;Humans;Leg;Locomotion;Musculoskeletal Equilibrium;Posture;Pressure;Psychomotor Performance;Stress, Mechanical;Volition;Weight-Bearing","98","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Consequently, there is a need for correction of this type of beat prior to any HRV analysis. This paper deals with the PSD estimation of the HRV by means of the heart timing (HT) signal when ectopic beats are present. These beat occurrence times are modeled from a generalized, continuous time integral pulse frequency modulation model and, from this point of view, a specific method for minimizing the effect of the presence of ectopic beats is presented to work together with the HT signal. By using both, a white noise driven autoregressive model of the HRV signal with artificially introduced ectopic beats and actual heart rate series including ectopic beats, the more usual methods of HRV spectral estimation are compared. Results of the PSD estimation error function of the number of ectopic beats are presented. These results demonstrate that the proposed method has one order of magnitude lower error than usual ectopic beats removal strategies in preserving PSD, thus, this strategy better recovers the original clinical indexes of interest.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2003.808831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1186737","","Heart rate variability;Signal analysis;Timing;Time domain analysis;Pulse modulation;Frequency modulation;Pacemakers;Frequency estimation;White noise;Heart rate","time-domain analysis;electrocardiography;medical signal processing;pulse frequency modulation;spectral analysis;white noise;physiological models","original clinical indexes of interest;generalized continuous time integral pulse frequency modulation model;power spectral density;electrodiagnostics;beat correction;white noise driven autoregressive model;actual heart rate series;ectopic beats removal strategies;ECG spectral analysis","Algorithms;Angioplasty, Transluminal, Percutaneous Coronary;Atrial Fibrillation;Cardiac Complexes, Premature;Computer Simulation;Databases, Factual;Heart;Heart;Heart Rate;Humans;Models, Cardiovascular;Models, Neurological;Quality Control;Reference Values;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","152","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An important component of an MRF-based approach is the inference algorithm used to find the most likely setting of each node in the MRF. Algorithms have been proposed which use graph cuts or belief propagation for inference. These stereo algorithms differ in both the inference algorithm used and the formulation of the MRF. It is unknown whether to attribute the responsibility for differences in performance to the MRF or the inference algorithm. We address this through controlled experiments by comparing the belief propagation algorithm and the graph cuts algorithm on the same MRF's, which have been created for calculating stereo disparities. We find that the labellings produced by the two algorithms are comparable. The solutions produced by graph cuts have a lower energy than those produced with belief propagation, but this does not necessarily lead to increased performance relative to the ground truth.","","0-7695-1950-4","10.1109/ICCV.2003.1238444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1238444","","Belief propagation;Inference algorithms;Stereo vision;Markov random fields;Computer vision;Pixel;Labeling;Testing;Computational efficiency;Costs","computer vision;stereo image processing;graph theory;Markov processes;random processes;belief networks;inference mechanisms","graph cuts;belief propagation;identical MRF parameters;disparity image modelling;Markov Random Field;inference algorithm;controlled experiments;stereo disparities;computational vision","","265","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore the model algorithm is computationally simple. There are only local connections among neurons. The computational complexity linearly depends on the neural network size.

Health monitoring involves collection of data about vital body parameters from different parts of the body and making decisions based on it. This information is of personal nature and is required to be secured. Insecurity may also lead to dangerous consequences. Due to the extreme constraints of energy, memory and computation securing the communication among the biosensors is not a trivial problem. Key distribution is central to any security mechanism.

It is shown that the derivatives of amplitude and phase of a plant model with respect to frequency can be approximated by Bode's integrals without any model of the plant. This information can be used to design a PID controller for slope adjustment of the Nyquist diagram and improve the closed-loop performance. Besides, the derivatives can be also employed to estimate the gradient and the Hessian of a frequency criterion in an iterative PID controller tuning method. The frequency criterion is defined as the sum of squared errors between the desired and measured gain margin, phase margin and crossover frequency. The method benefits from specific feedback relay tests to determine the gain margin, the phase margin and the crossover frequency of the closed-loop system.

Past work has not considered the second-order statistics of the interference and has relied on the assumption that interference samples are independent. In this paper, we provide analytic expressions for the interference second-order statistics and show that depending on the properties of the users' holding times, the interference can be correlated.

The model is implemented in MATLAB and verified against PSCAD/EMTDC in the time and frequency domains. The verification demonstrates very good system gain accuracy in a wide frequency range f < 150 Hz, whereas the phase angle shows somewhat inferior matching above 25 Hz.

After showing that ordinary least-squares (OLS) algorithms, classically employed in the literature, are quite unreliable in the presence of noisy measurements, which is not the case for TLS, the TLS EXIN neuron is applied numerically and experimentally for retrieving the parameters of an induction motor by means of a test bench. Additionally, for the case of very noisy data, a refinement of the TLS estimation has been obtained by the application of a constrained optimization algorithm which explicitly takes into account the relationships among the K-parameters.

Proceedings.","","2003","","","14","23","Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) attempt to identify attacks by comparing collected data to predefined signatures known to be malicious (misuse-based IDSs) or to a model of legal behavior (anomaly-based IDSs). Anomaly-based approaches have the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks, but they suffer from the difficulty of building robust models of acceptable behavior, which may result in a large number of false alarms. Almost all current anomaly-based intrusion detection systems classify an input event as normal or anomalous by analyzing its features, utilizing a number of different models. A decision for an input event is made by aggregating the results of all employed models. We have identified two reasons for the large number of false alarms, caused by incorrect classification of events in current systems. One is the simplistic aggregation of model outputs in the decision phase. Often, only the sum of the model results is calculated and compared to a threshold. The other reason is the lack of integration of additional information into the decision process. This additional information can be related to the models, such as the confidence in a model's output, or can be extracted from external sources. To mitigate these shortcomings, we propose an event classification scheme that is based on Bayesian networks. Bayesian networks improve the aggregation of different model outputs and allow one to seamlessly incorporate additional information. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the event classification process is significantly improved using our proposed approach.","","0-7695-2041-3","10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254306","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254306","","Bayesian methods;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Robustness;Data mining;Operating systems;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Floods","belief networks;pattern classification;computer crime;message authentication","Bayesian event classification;predefined malicious signatures;misuse-based IDS;anomaly-based IDS;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;input event decision;Bayesian networks;model output aggregation","","110","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To characterize mouse ZP mechanical properties and quantitate the mechanical property differences of the ZP before and after fertilization, a microelectromechanical systems-based multiaxis cellular force sensor has been developed. A microrobotic cell manipulation system employing the multiaxis cellular force sensor is used to conduct mouse ZP force sensing, establishing a quantitative relationship between applied forces and biomembrane structural deformations on both mouse oocytes and embryos. An analytical biomembrane elastic model is constructed to describe biomembrane mechanical properties. The characterized elastic modulus of embryos is 2.3 times that of oocytes, and the measured forces for puncturing embryo ZP are 1.7 times those for oocyte ZP.

Digital cameras attached to cellular phones, PDAs, or as standalone still or video devices are highly mobile and easy to use; they can capture images of any kind of document including very thick books, historical pages too fragile to touch, and text in scenes; and they are much more versatile than desktop scanners. Should robust solutions to the analysis of documents captured with such devices become available, there is clearly a demand from many domains. Traditional scanner-based document analysis techniques provide us with a good reference and starting point, but they cannot be used directly on camera-captured images. Camera captured images can suffer from low resolution, blur, and perspective distortion, as well as complex layout and interaction of the content and background. In this paper we present a survey of application domains, technical challenges and solutions for recognizing documents captured by digital cameras.

BICM is capable of achieving excellent error performance provided that powerful codes, such as for example turbo codes or low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, are employed. We address the problem of finding the signal sets that are the most suitable ones for designing power-efficient BICM schemes over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. To this end, we exploit the expression of the BICM capacity limit, and evaluate it for several 8- and 16-ary constellations. The bit-error rate (BER) performance of some BICM schemes made up of turbo codes and various signal sets is also investigated by computer simulations so as to illustrate the theoretical results. We show that, for spectral efficiencies of practical interest, the most attractive signal sets are those for which Gray mapping is possible, provided that their symbol error rate performance is ""sufficiently close"" to the optimum. This explains why some constellations having a simple structure, such as 8-PSK and 16-QAM, perform very well when combined with a powerful code. At the same time, the constellations displaying optimal error performance without coding are, generally, not of interest for BICM.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2002.806152","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1159786","","Constellation diagram;Interleaved codes;Modulation coding;AWGN;Turbo codes;Parity check codes;Bit error rate;Signal design;Additive white noise;Computer simulation","binary codes;error correction codes;parity check codes;turbo codes;modulation coding;concatenated codes;interleaved codes;AWGN channels;channel capacity;error statistics;phase shift keying;quadrature amplitude modulation","signal constellations;bit-interleaved coded modulation;bandwidth-efficient coding;serial concatenation;binary error-correcting coding;bit-by-bit interleaving;high-order modulation;error performance;turbo codes;low-density parity-check codes;LDPC codes;signal sets;additive white Gaussian noise channel;AWGN channel;BICM capacity limit;16-ary constellations;8-ary constellations;bit-error rate performance;BER performance;spectral efficiency;Gray mapping;symbol error rate performance;8-PSK;16-QAM;optimal error performance","","70","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The discriminative random fields offer several advantages over the conventional Markov random field (MRF) framework. First, the DRFs allow to relax the strong assumption of conditional independence of the observed data generally used in the MRF framework for tractability. This assumption is too restrictive for a large number of applications in vision. Second, the DRFs derive their classification power by exploiting the probabilistic discriminative models instead of the generative models used in the MRF framework. Finally, all the parameters in the DRF model are estimated simultaneously from the training data unlike the MRF framework where likelihood parameters are usually learned separately from the field parameters.

Different interpretations of the harmonic distortion limits set in the IEEE 519-1992 standard are performed together with a comparison with the BC Hydro's harmonic current limits. This paper also includes a statistical analysis of all measurements recorded with the help of two PQ monitors, an evaluation of the results from a connection/disconnection test, and harmonic simulation results.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2003.809685","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1193873","","Distributed power generation;Power generation;Power quality;Photovoltaic systems;Solar power generation;Costs;Dispersion;Harmonic distortion;Statistical analysis;Distortion measurement","distributed power generation;photovoltaic power systems;distribution networks;invertors;IEEE standards;power supply quality","PV dispersed generator;power quality analysis;IEEE 519-1992 standard;BC Hydro's harmonic current limits;statistical analysis;PQ monitors;connection/disconnection test;environmentally clean photovoltaic dispersed generation;cost reductions;power quality;inverter-interfaced PV dispersed generation;electric power quality;harmonic distortion limit;100 kW","","59","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"An automatic approach to the detection and extraction of mine features in sidescan sonar","S. Reed; Y. Petillot; J. Bell","Dept. of Comput. & Electr.

Eng., Heriot-Watt Univ., UK","IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","","2003","28","1","90","105","Mine detection and classification using high-resolution sidescan sonar is a critical technology for mine counter measures (MCM). As opposed to the majority of techniques which require large training data sets, this paper presents unsupervised models for both the detection and the shadow extraction phases of an automated classification system. The detection phase is carried out using an unsupervised Markov random field (MRF) model where the required model parameters are estimated from the original image. Using a priori spatial information on the physical size and geometric signature of mines in sidescan sonar, a detection-orientated MRF model is developed which directly segments the image into regions of shadow, seabottom-reverberation, and object-highlight. After detection, features are extracted so that the object can be classified. A novel co-operating statistical snake (CSS) model is presented which extracts the highlight and shadow of the object. The CSS model again utilizes available a priori information on the spatial relationship between the highlight and shadow, allowing accurate segmentation of the object's shadow to be achieved.","1558-1691","","10.1109/JOE.2002.808199","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1190138","","Sonar detection;Feature extraction;Data mining;Sonar measurements;Phase detection;Cascading style sheets;Counting circuits;Training data;Markov random fields;Parameter estimation","sonar detection;military radar;Markov processes;electronic countermeasures","sidescan sonar;mine detection;mine counter measures;unsupervised models;shadow extraction phases;automated classification system;unsupervised Markov random field;model parameters;a priori spatial information;seabottom-reverberation;co-operating statistical snake","","123","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Modified JPEG Huffman coding","G. Lakhani","Texas Tech Univ., Lubbock, TX, USA","IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","","2003","12","2","159","169","It is a well observed characteristic that when a DCT block is traversed in the zigzag order, the AC coefficients generally decrease in size and the run-length of zero coefficients increase in number. This article presents a minor modification to the Huffman coding of the JPEG baseline compression algorithm to exploit this redundancy. For this purpose, DCT blocks are divided into bands so that each band can be coded using a separate code table. Three implementations are presented, which all move the end-of-block marker up in the middle of DCT block and use it to indicate the band boundaries. Experimental results are presented to compare reduction in the code size obtained by our methods with the JPEG sequential-mode Huffman coding and arithmetic coding methods. The average code reduction to the total image code size of one of our methods is 4%. Our methods can also be used for progressive image transmission and hence, experimental results are also given to compare them with two-, three-, and four-band implementations of the JPEG spectral selection method.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2003.809001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1192978","","Huffman coding;Transform coding;Discrete cosine transforms;Image coding;Compression algorithms;Entropy coding;Arithmetic;Quantization;Image communication;Codecs","adaptive codes;Huffman codes;image coding;data compression;transform coding;discrete cosine transforms;arithmetic codes;sequential codes;visual communication;code standards;telecommunication standards","modified JPEG Huffman coding;AC coefficients;run-length;zero coefficients;JPEG baseline compression algorithm;redundancy;code table;end-of-block marker;DCT block;band boundaries;code size reduction;JPEG sequential-mode Huffman coding;arithmetic coding;average code reduction;image code size;progressive image transmission;JPEG spectral selection method;adaptive Huffman coding","","22","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
