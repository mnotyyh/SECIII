If x is known to be compressible by transform coding with a known transform, and we reconstruct via the nonlinear procedure defined here, the number of measurements n can be dramatically smaller than the size m. Thus, certain natural classes of images with m pixels need only n=O(m1/4log5/2(m)) nonadaptive nonpixel samples for faithful recovery, as opposed to the usual m pixel samples. More specifically, suppose x has a sparse representation in some orthonormal basis (e.g., wavelet, Fourier) or tight frame (e.g., curvelet, Gabor)-so the coefficients belong to an lscrp ball for 0<ples1. The N most important coefficients in that expansion allow reconstruction with lscr2 error O(N1/2-1p/). It is possible to design n=O(Nlog(m)) nonadaptive measurements allowing reconstruction with accuracy comparable to that attainable with direct knowledge of the N most important coefficients. Moreover, a good approximation to those N important coefficients is extracted from the n measurements by solving a linear program-Basis Pursuit in signal processing. The nonadaptive measurements have the character of ""random"" linear combinations of basis/frame elements. Our results use the notions of optimal recovery, of n-widths, and information-based complexity. We estimate the Gel'fand n-widths of lscrp balls in high-dimensional Euclidean space in the case 0<ples1, and give a criterion identifying near- optimal subspaces for Gel'fand n-widths. We show that ""most"" subspaces are near-optimal, and show that convex optimization (Basis Pursuit) is a near-optimal way to extract information derived from these near-optimal subspaces","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2006.871582","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1614066","Adaptive sampling;almost-spherical sections of Banach spaces;Basis Pursuit;eigenvalues of random matrices;Gel'fand;information-based complexity;integrated sensing and processing;minimum;optimal recovery;Quotient-of-a-Subspace theorem;sparse solution of linear equations","Compressed sensing;Image reconstruction;Pixel;Vectors;Digital images;Image coding;Transform coding;Size measurement;Signal processing;Data mining","convex programming;data compression;image coding;image reconstruction;image sampling;image sensors;sparse matrices;transform coding","sensing compression;general linear functional measurement;transform coding;image reconstruction;nonadaptive nonpixel sampling;sparse representation;signal processing;Euclidean space;convex optimization","","14613","","47","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the increasing number of DPGSs connected to the utility network, new and stricter standards in respect to power quality, safe running, and islanding protection are issued. As a consequence, the control of distributed generation systems should be improved to meet the requirements for grid interconnection.

Math., California Inst. of Technol., Pasadena, CA, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","","2006","52","2","489","509","This paper considers the model problem of reconstructing an object from incomplete frequency samples. Consider a discrete-time signal f/spl isin/C/sup N/ and a randomly chosen set of frequencies /spl Omega/. Is it possible to reconstruct f from the partial knowledge of its Fourier coefficients on the set /spl Omega/? A typical result of this paper is as follows. Suppose that f is a superposition of |T| spikes f(t)=/spl sigma//sub /spl tau//spl isin/T/f(/spl tau/)/spl delta/(t-/spl tau/) obeying |T|/spl les/C/sub M//spl middot/(log N)/sup -1/ /spl middot/ |/spl Omega/| for some constant C/sub M/>0. We do not know the locations of the spikes nor their amplitudes. Then with probability at least 1-O(N/sup -M/), f can be reconstructed exactly as the solution to the /spl lscr//sub 1/ minimization problem. In short, exact recovery may be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. We give numerical values for C/sub M/ which depend on the desired probability of success. Our result may be interpreted as a novel kind of nonlinear sampling theorem. In effect, it says that any signal made out of |T| spikes may be recovered by convex programming from almost every set of frequencies of size O(|T|/spl middot/logN). Moreover, this is nearly optimal in the sense that any method succeeding with probability 1-O(N/sup -M/) would in general require a number of frequency samples at least proportional to |T|/spl middot/logN. The methodology extends to a variety of other situations and higher dimensions. For example, we show how one can reconstruct a piecewise constant (one- or two-dimensional) object from incomplete frequency samples - provided that the number of jumps (discontinuities) obeys the condition above - by minimizing other convex functionals such as the total variation of f.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2005.862083","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1580791","Convex optimization;duality in optimization;free probability;image reconstruction;linear programming;random matrices;sparsity;total-variation minimization;trigonometric expansions;uncertainty principle","Robustness;Uncertainty;Signal reconstruction;Frequency;Image reconstruction;Mathematics;Biomedical imaging;Sampling methods;Linear programming;Signal processing","image reconstruction;linear programming;convex programming;minimisation;Fourier analysis;image sampling;piecewise constant techniques;probability;sparse matrices;indeterminancy;signal reconstruction;signal sampling","robust uncertainty principle;signal reconstruction;incomplete frequency information;discrete-time signal;Fourier coefficient;minimization problem;convex optimization;image reconstruction;linear programming;sparse random matrix;trigonometric expansion;nonlinear sampling theorem;piecewise constant object;probability value","","8707","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Sci., Technion-Israel Inst. of Technol., Haifa","IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","","2006","54","11","4311","4322","In recent years there has been a growing interest in the study of sparse representation of signals. Using an overcomplete dictionary that contains prototype signal-atoms, signals are described by sparse linear combinations of these atoms. Applications that use sparse representation are many and include compression, regularization in inverse problems, feature extraction, and more. Recent activity in this field has concentrated mainly on the study of pursuit algorithms that decompose signals with respect to a given dictionary. Designing dictionaries to better fit the above model can be done by either selecting one from a prespecified set of linear transforms or adapting the dictionary to a set of training signals. Both of these techniques have been considered, but this topic is largely still open. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm for adapting dictionaries in order to achieve sparse signal representations. Given a set of training signals, we seek the dictionary that leads to the best representation for each member in this set, under strict sparsity constraints. We present a new method-the K-SVD algorithm-generalizing the K-means clustering process. K-SVD is an iterative method that alternates between sparse coding of the examples based on the current dictionary and a process of updating the dictionary atoms to better fit the data. The update of the dictionary columns is combined with an update of the sparse representations, thereby accelerating convergence. The K-SVD algorithm is flexible and can work with any pursuit method (e.g., basis pursuit, FOCUSS, or matching pursuit). We analyze this algorithm and demonstrate its results both on synthetic tests and in applications on real image data","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2006.881199","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1710377","Atom decomposition;basis pursuit;codebook;dictionary;FOCUSS;gain-shape VQ;matching pursuit;sparse representation;training;vector quantization","Algorithm design and analysis;Dictionaries;Matching pursuit algorithms;Pursuit algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Iterative algorithms;Prototypes;Inverse problems;Feature extraction;Signal design","image coding;image representation;iterative methods;singular value decomposition;transforms","signals sparse representation;linear transforms;sparsity constraints;K-SVD;K-means clustering process;iterative method;sparse coding;overcomplete dictionary;image data","","5193","","47","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This model accounts for all dynamic characteristics of the battery, from nonlinear open-circuit voltage, current-, temperature-, cycle number-, and storage time-dependent capacity to transient response. A simplified model neglecting the effects of self-discharge, cycle number, and temperature, which are nonconsequential in low-power Li-ion-supplied applications, is validated with experimental data on NiMH and polymer Li-ion batteries. Less than 0.4% runtime error and 30-mV maximum error voltage show that the proposed model predicts both the battery runtime and I-V performance accurately.

Based on the reactive power controls adopted, three power management strategies are identified and investigated. These strategies are based on 1) voltage-droop characteristic, 2) voltage regulation, and 3) load reactive power compensation. The real power of each DG unit is controlled based on a frequency-droop characteristic and a complimentary frequency restoration strategy. A systematic approach to develop a small-signal dynamic model of a multiple-DG microgrid, including real and reactive power management strategies, is also presented. The microgrid eigen structure, based on the developed model, is used to 1) investigate the microgrid dynamic behavior, 2) select control parameters of DG units, and 3) incorporate power management strategies in the DG controllers.

Two cases of flocking in free-space and presence of multiple obstacles are considered. We present three flocking algorithms: two for free-flocking and one for constrained flocking. A comprehensive analysis of the first two algorithms is provided. We demonstrate the first algorithm embodies all three rules of Reynolds. This is a formal approach to extraction of interaction rules that lead to the emergence of collective behavior. We show that the first algorithm generically leads to regular fragmentation, whereas the second and third algorithms both lead to flocking. A systematic method is provided for construction of cost functions (or collective potentials) for flocking. These collective potentials penalize deviation from a class of lattice-shape objects called /spl alpha/-lattices. We use a multi-species framework for construction of collective potentials that consist of flock-members, or /spl alpha/-agents, and virtual agents associated with /spl alpha/-agents called /spl beta/- and /spl gamma/-agents.

In these systems, robust and reliable vehicle detection is a critical step. This paper presents a review of recent vision-based on-road vehicle detection systems. Our focus is on systems where the camera is mounted on the vehicle rather than being fixed such as in traffic/driveway monitoring systems. First, we discuss the problem of on-road vehicle detection using optical sensors followed by a brief review of intelligent vehicle research worldwide. Then, we discuss active and passive sensors to set the stage for vision-based vehicle detection. Methods aiming to quickly hypothesize the location of vehicles in an image as well as to verify the hypothesized locations are reviewed next. Integrating detection with tracking is also reviewed to illustrate the benefits of exploiting temporal continuity for vehicle detection. Finally, we present a critical overview of the methods discussed, we assess their potential for future deployment, and we present directions for future research.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2006.104","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1608034","Vehicle detection;computer vision;intelligent vehicles.","Vehicle detection;Vehicle driving;Intelligent sensors;Remotely operated vehicles;Intelligent vehicles;Automotive engineering;Robustness;Accidents;Road vehicles;Mobile robots","automobiles;object detection;driver information systems;optical sensors;road accidents","on-road vehicle detection;on-board automotive driver assistance systems;optical sensors;intelligent vehicle;temporal continuity","Accidents, Traffic;Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Automobile Driving;Automobiles;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Safety","621","","121","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Adapting these amplifiers to wideband operation therefore entails larger size and higher cost than would otherwise be required for the same power output. An alternative solution, which is gaining widespread popularity, is to employ digital baseband predistortion ahead of the amplifier to compensate for the nonlinearity effects, hence allowing it to run closer to its maximum output power while maintaining low spectral regrowth. Recent improvements to the technique have included memory effects in the predistortion model, which are essential as the bandwidth increases. In this paper, we relate the general Volterra representation to the classical Wiener, Hammerstein, Wiener-Hammerstein, and parallel Wiener structures, and go on to describe some state-of-the-art predistortion models based on memory polynomials.

The possible wide range of grid impedance values (distributed generation is suited for remote areas with radial distribution plants) challenge the stability and the effectiveness of the LCL-filter-based current controlled system. It has been found out and it will be demonstrated in this paper that the use of active damping helps to stabilise the system in respect to many different kinds of resonances. The use of active damping results in an easy plug-in feature of the generation system in a vast range of grid conditions and in a more flexible operation of the overall system able to manage sudden grid changes.

Based on similar control theory, PR filters can also be used for generating the harmonic command reference precisely in an active power filter, especially for single-phase systems, where d-q transformation theory is not directly applicable. Another advantage associated with the PR controllers and filters is the possibility of implementing selective harmonic compensation without requiring excessive computational resources.

To create the training data for a base classifier, the feature set is randomly split into K subsets (K is a parameter of the algorithm) and principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to each subset. All principal components are retained in order to preserve the variability information in the data. Thus, K axis rotations take place to form the new features for a base classifier. The idea of the rotation approach is to encourage simultaneously individual accuracy and diversity within the ensemble. Diversity is promoted through the feature extraction for each base classifier. Decision trees were chosen here because they are sensitive to rotation of the feature axes, hence the name ""forest"". Accuracy is sought by keeping all principal components and also using the whole data set to train each base classifier. Using WEKA, we examined the rotation forest ensemble on a random selection of 33 benchmark data sets from the UCI repository and compared it with bagging, AdaBoost, and random forest. The results were favorable to rotation forest and prompted an investigation into diversity-accuracy landscape of the ensemble models. Diversity-error diagrams revealed that rotation forest ensembles construct individual classifiers which are more accurate than these in AdaBoost and random forest, and more diverse than these in bagging, sometimes more accurate as well","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2006.211","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1677518","Classifier ensembles;AdaBoost;bagging;random forest;feature extraction;PCA;kappa-error diagrams.","Bagging;Feature extraction;Principal component analysis;Decision trees;Voting;Computer Society;Training data;Classification tree analysis;Machine learning;Pattern recognition","decision trees;feature extraction;pattern classification;principal component analysis","rotation forest;classifier ensemble method;feature extraction;principal component analysis;decision trees;diversity-accuracy landscape;bagging;AdaBoost","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Computer Simulation;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Statistical;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Principal Component Analysis;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","943","","47","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The novelty consists in generating the orthogonal voltage system using a structure based on second order generalized integrator (SOGI). The proposed structure has the following advantages: — it has a simple implementation; — the generated orthogonal system is filtered without delay by the same structure due to its resonance at the fundamental frequency, — the proposed structure is not affected by the frequency changes.

All three of these ingredients feature in the echo-location system of a bat, which may be viewed as a physical realization (albeit in neurobiological terms) of cognitive radar.

Such ""full-reference"" QA methods attempt to achieve consistency in quality prediction by modeling salient physiological and psychovisual features of the human visual system (HVS), or by signal fidelity measures. In this paper, we approach the image QA problem as an information fidelity problem. Specifically, we propose to quantify the loss of image information to the distortion process and explore the relationship between image information and visual quality. QA systems are invariably involved with judging the visual quality of ""natural"" images and videos that are meant for ""human consumption."" Researchers have developed sophisticated models to capture the statistics of such natural signals. Using these models, we previously presented an information fidelity criterion for image QA that related image quality with the amount of information shared between a reference and a distorted image. In this paper, we propose an image information measure that quantifies the information that is present in the reference image and how much of this reference information can be extracted from the distorted image. Combining these two quantities, we propose a visual information fidelity measure for image QA. We validate the performance of our algorithm with an extensive subjective study involving 779 images and show that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art image QA algorithms by a sizeable margin in our simulations. The code and the data from the subjective study are available at the LIVE website.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2005.859378","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1576816","Image information;image quality assessment (QA);information fidelity;natural scene statistics (NSS)","Distortion measurement;Image quality;Humans;Quality assessment;Algorithm design and analysis;Predictive models;Psychology;Visual system;Video sharing;Statistics","visual perception;image enhancement","image information;visual quality;quality assessment;image quality;human visual system;signal fidelity measures;distorted image;visual information fidelity","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biomimetics;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","1651","","39","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Fundamental frequency models have been presented but these models are often complex with significant numerical overhead as the power converter block consisting of power control, rotor side and grid side converter control and DC link are often simulated in detail. This paper develops a simple DFIG wind turbine model in which the power converter is simulated as a controlled voltage source, regulating the rotor current to meet the command of real and reactive power production. This model has the form of traditional generator model and hence is easy to integrate into the power system simulation tool such as PSS/E. As an example, the interaction between the Arklow Bank Wind Farm and the Irish National Grid was simulated using the proposed model. The model performance and accuracy was also compared with the detailed model developed by DIgSILENT. Considering the simplification adopted for the model development, the limitation and applicability of the model were also discussed in this paper.","1558-0059","","10.1109/TEC.2005.847958","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1597345","Induction generators;power system transient stability;reactive power control;variable speed drives;wind power generation","Wind turbines;Induction generators;Power system modeling;Power system simulation;Rotors;Power quality;Energy efficiency;Controllability;Frequency conversion;Power control","wind turbines;asynchronous generators;power grids;power convertors;voltage control;rotors;reactive power","doubly fed induction generator;grid integration study;power quality;high energy efficiency;controllability improvement;variable speed wind turbine;numerical overhead;power converter;power control;rotor side;grid side converter control;power system simulation;Arklow Bank Wind Farm;Irish National Grid","","423","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The suggested applications are for studies in the field of human movement. In the proposed EKF, the quaternion associated with the body rotation is included in the state vector together with the bias of the aiding system sensors. Moreover, in addition to the in-line procedure of sensor bias compensation, the measurement noise covariance matrix is adapted, to guard against the effects which body motion and temporary magnetic disturbance may have on the reliability of measurements of gravity and earth's magnetic field, respectively. By computer simulations and experimental validation with human hand orientation motion signals, improvements in the accuracy of orientation estimates are demonstrated for the proposed EKF, as compared with filter implementations where either the in-line calibration procedure, the adaptive mechanism for weighting the measurements of the aiding system sensors, or both are not implemented.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2006.875664","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1643403","Earth's magnetic field sensing;extended Kalman filter;human motion tracking;inertial sensing;quaternion","Magnetic separation;Magnetic sensors;Magnetic field measurement;Sensor systems;Motion measurement;Quaternions;Noise measurement;Accelerometers;Magnetometers;Magnetic noise","biomechanics;biomagnetism;medical signal processing;Kalman filters;accelerometers;magnetometers;magnetic sensors;noise;covariance matrices;calibration","quaternion-based extended Kalman filter;inertial sensing;magnetic sensing;tri-axis gyro;tri-axis accelerometer;tri-axis magnetometer;human movement;body rotation;aiding system sensors;sensor bias compensation;measurement noise covariance matrix;temporary magnetic disturbance;gravity;earth magnetic field;human hand orientation motion signals;filter implementations;in-line calibration;weighting","Acceleration;Algorithms;Biomechanics;Computer Simulation;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Filtration;Hand;Humans;Magnetics;Models, Biological;Movement;Orientation","459","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, we show that a zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) strategy, while generally suboptimal, can achieve the same asymptotic sum capacity as that of DPC, as the number of users goes to infinity. In proving this asymptotic result, we provide an algorithm for determining which users should be active under ZFBF. These users are semiorthogonal to one another and can be grouped for simultaneous transmission to enhance the throughput of scheduling algorithms. Based on the user grouping, we propose and compare two fair scheduling schemes in round-robin ZFBF and proportional-fair ZFBF.

However, most of the proposed solutions require distributed space-time coding algorithms, the careful design of which is left for future investigation if there is more than one cooperative relay. We propose a novel scheme that alleviates these problems and provides diversity gains on the order of the number of relays in the network. Our scheme first selects the best relay from a set of M available relays and then uses this ""best"" relay for cooperation between the source and the destination. We develop and analyze a distributed method to select the best relay that requires no topology information and is based on local measurements of the instantaneous channel conditions. This method also requires no explicit communication among the relays. The success (or failure) to select the best available path depends on the statistics of the wireless channel, and a methodology to evaluate performance for any kind of wireless channel statistics, is provided. Information theoretic analysis of outage probability shows that our scheme achieves the same diversity-multiplexing tradeoff as achieved by more complex protocols, where coordination and distributed space-time coding for M relay nodes is required, such as those proposed by Laneman and Wornell (2003).

A principal advantage of SC-FDMA is the peak-to-average power ratio (PARR), which is lower than that of OFDMA. SC FDMA is currently a strong candidate for the uplink multiple access scheme in the long term evolution of cellular systems under consideration by the third generation partnership project (3GPP). In this paper, we give an overview of SC-FDMA. We also analyze the effects of subcarrier mapping on throughput and PARR. Among the possible subcarrier mapping approaches, we find that localized FDMA (LFDMA) with channel-dependent scheduling (CDS) results in higher throughput than interleaved FDMA (JFDMA).

It is therefore important to take a critical look at key aspects of these systems, one of which is lane-position tracking. It is for these driver-assistance objectives that motivate the development of the novel ""video-based lane estimation and tracking"" (VioLET) system. The system is designed using steerable filters for robust and accurate lane-marking detection. Steerable filters provide an efficient method for detecting circular-reflector markings, solid-line markings, and segmented-line markings under varying lighting and road conditions. They help in providing robustness to complex shadowing, lighting changes from overpasses and tunnels, and road-surface variations. They are efficient for lane-marking extraction because by computing only three separable convolutions, we can extract a wide variety of lane markings. Curvature detection is made more robust by incorporating both visual cues (lane markings and lane texture) and vehicle-state information. The experiment design and evaluation of the VioLET system is shown using multiple quantitative metrics over a wide variety of test conditions on a large test path using a unique instrumented vehicle. A justification for the choice of metrics based on a previous study with human-factors applications as well as extensive ground-truth testing from different times of day, road conditions, weather, and driving scenarios is also presented. In order to design the VioLET system, an up-to-date and comprehensive analysis of the current state of the art in lane-detection research was first performed. In doing so, a comparison of a wide variety of methods, pointing out the similarities and differences between methods as well as when and where various methods are most useful, is presented","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2006.869595","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1603550","Active safety systems;intelligent vehicles;lane detection;lane-departure warning;machine vision;performance metrics","Robustness;Filters;Roads;Data mining;System testing;Monitoring;Vehicle driving;Navigation;Shadow mapping;Vehicle detection","computer vision;driver information systems;object detection;road vehicles;video signal processing","video lane estimation and tracking system;driver assistance system;driver monitoring;lane position tracking;steerable filters;circular reflector markings;curvature detection;machine vision","","655","","45","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The process of consulting ""several experts"" before making a final decision is perhaps second nature to us; yet, the extensive benefits of such a process in automated decision making applications have only recently been discovered by computational intelligence community. Also known under various other names, such as multiple classifier systems, committee of classifiers, or mixture of experts, ensemble based systems have shown to produce favorable results compared to those of single-expert systems for a broad range of applications and under a variety of scenarios. Design, implementation and application of such systems are the main topics of this article. Specifically, this paper reviews conditions under which ensemble based systems may be more beneficial than their single classifier counterparts, algorithms for generating individual components of the ensemble systems, and various procedures through which the individual classifiers can be combined. We discuss popular ensemble based algorithms, such as bagging, boosting, AdaBoost, stacked generalization, and hierarchical mixture of experts; as well as commonly used combination rules, including algebraic combination of outputs, voting based techniques, behavior knowledge space, and decision templates.

The experimental HEV uses lead-acid batteries, an ultracapacitor (UCAP) bank, and a brushless dc motor with nominal power of 32 kW, and a peak power of 53 kW. The digital signal processor (DSP) control system measures and stores the following parameters: primary-source voltage, car speed, instantaneous currents in both terminals (primary source and UCAP), and actual voltage of the UCAP.

The fact that wind power penetration continues to increase has motivated a need to develop more widely applicable methodologies for evaluating the actual benefits of adding wind turbines to conventional generating systems. Reliability evaluation of generating systems with wind energy sources is a complex process. It requires an accurate wind speed forecasting technique for the wind farm site. The method requires historical wind speed data collected over many years for the wind farm location to determine the necessary parameters of the wind speed models for the particular site. The evaluation process should also accurately model the intermittent nature of power output from the wind farm. A sequential Monte Carlo simulation or a multistate wind farm representation approach is often used. This paper presents a simplified method for reliability evaluation of power systems with wind power. The development of a common wind speed model applicable to multiple wind farm locations is presented and illustrated with an example. The method is further simplified by determining the minimum multistate representation for a wind farm generation model in reliability evaluation. The paper presents a six-step common wind speed model applicable to multiple geographic locations and adequate for reliability evaluation of power systems containing significant wind penetration.

Thus, it is imperative that automotive electrical power systems will obviously undergo a drastic change in the next 10-20 years. Currently, the situation in the automotive industry is such that the demands for higher fuel economy and more electric power are driving advanced vehicular power system voltages to higher levels. For example, the projected increase in total power demand is estimated to be about three to four times that of the current value. This means that the total future power demand of a typical advanced vehicle could roughly reach a value as high as 10 kW. In order to satisfy this huge vehicular load, the approach is to integrate power electronics intensive solutions within advanced vehicular power systems.

The strategy is based on the direct control of stator active and reactive power by selecting appropriate voltage vectors on the rotor side. It is found that the initial rotor flux has no impact on the changes of the stator active and reactive power. The proposed method only utilizes the estimated stator flux so as to remove the difficulties associated with rotor flux estimation.

At present, there is no closed-form solution to the PHD recursion. This paper shows that under linear, Gaussian assumptions on the target dynamics and birth process, the posterior intensity at any time step is a Gaussian mixture. More importantly, closed-form recursions for propagating the means, covariances, and weights of the constituent Gaussian components of the posterior intensity are derived.

To overcome the conventional limits on bandwidth extension ratios, these techniques augment inductive peaking using capacitive splitting and magnetic coupling. It is shown that a critical design constraint for optimum bandwidth extension is the ratio of the drain capacitance of the driver transistor to the load capacitance. This, in turn, recommends the use of different techniques for different capacitance ratios.

The third-order continuous-time SigmaDelta modulator comprises a third-order RC operational-amplifier-based loop filter and 4-bit internal quantizer operating at 640 MHz.

However, receiver and transmitter channel state information is generally required. In this correspondence, a system where each receiver has perfect channel knowledge, but the transmitter only receives quantized information regarding the channel instantiation is analyzed. The well-known zero-forcing transmission technique is considered, and simple expressions for the throughput degradation due to finite-rate feedback are derived. A key finding is that the feedback rate per mobile must be increased linearly with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (in decibels) in order to achieve the full multiplexing gain.

The key insight is that, rather than learning from scratch, one can take advantage of knowledge coming from previously learned categories, no matter how different these categories might be. We explore a Bayesian implementation of this idea. Object categories are represented by probabilistic models. Prior knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The posterior model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. We test a simple implementation of our algorithm on a database of 101 diverse object categories. We compare category models learned by an implementation of our Bayesian approach to models learned from by maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) methods.

Appropriate or correct and suitable algorithms will fulfill its function fast enough, that is, to find an optimal path for the robot to traverse in, even if there are a large number of obstacles cluttered in a complex environment.

The recessed-gate structure is very attractive for realizing normally off high-voltage AlGaN/GaN HEMTs because the gate threshold voltage can be controlled by the etching depth of the recess without significant increase in on-resistance characteristics. With this structure the threshold voltage can be increased with the reduction of two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) density only under the gate electrode without reduction of 2DEG density in the other channel regions such as the channel between drain and gate. The threshold-voltage increase was experimentally demonstrated. The threshold voltage of fabricated recessed-gate device increased to -0.14 V while the threshold voltage without the recessed-gate structure was about -4 V. The specific on-resistance of the device was maintained as low as 4 m/spl Omega//spl middot/cm/sup 2/ and the breakdown voltage was 435 V. The on-resistance and the breakdown voltage tradeoff characteristics were the same as those of normally on devices. From the viewpoint of device design, the on-resistance for the normally off device was modeled using the relationship between the AlGaN layer thickness under the gate electrode and the 2DEG density. It is found that the MIS gate structure and the recess etching without the offset region between recess edge and gate electrode will further improve the on-resistance. The simulation results show the possibility of the on-resistance below 1 m/spl Omega//spl middot/cm/sup 2/ for normally off AlGaN/GaN HEMTs operating at several hundred volts with threshold voltage up to +1 V.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2005.862708","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1580874","GaN;high-electron mobility transistors (HEMTs);high voltage;recessed gate","Power MODFETs;Power semiconductor devices;Aluminum compounds;Gallium compounds","power HEMT;power semiconductor devices;semiconductor device breakdown;wide band gap semiconductors;III-V semiconductors;aluminium compounds;gallium compounds","recessed gate structure;power electronics applications;high-electron mobility transistors;gate threshold voltage;etching depth;two-dimensional electron gas density;gate electrode;MIS gate structure;435 V;AlGaN-GaN","","295","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, in general, the problem of finding sparse representations must be unstable in the presence of noise. This paper establishes the possibility of stable recovery under a combination of sufficient sparsity and favorable structure of the overcomplete system. Considering an ideal underlying signal that has a sufficiently sparse representation, it is assumed that only a noisy version of it can be observed. Assuming further that the overcomplete system is incoherent, it is shown that the optimally sparse approximation to the noisy data differs from the optimally sparse decomposition of the ideal noiseless signal by at most a constant multiple of the noise level. As this optimal-sparsity method requires heavy (combinatorial) computational effort, approximation algorithms are considered. It is shown that similar stability is also available using the basis and the matching pursuit algorithms. Furthermore, it is shown that these methods result in sparse approximation of the noisy data that contains only terms also appearing in the unique sparsest representation of the ideal noiseless sparse signal.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2005.860430","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1564423","Basis pursuit;greedy approximation;incoherent dictionary;Kruskal rank;matching pursuit;overcomplete representation;sparse representation;stability;stepwise regression;superresolution","Signal processing;Matching pursuit algorithms;Dictionaries;Vectors;Noise level;Signal processing algorithms;Stability;Signal representations;Linear algebra;Noise generators","signal representation;approximation theory;signal denoising;iterative methods;time-frequency analysis","stable recovery;sparse overcomplete representation;signal processing theory;noisy data;optimal sparse decomposition;greedy approximation algorithm;matching pursuit;incoherent dictionary;Kruskal rank;stepwise regression;superresolution signal","","1199","","43","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Valenzuela","NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","","2006","54","3","823","838","Inspired by recent advances in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications, this proposal introduces the statistical MIMO radar concept. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that the statistical MIMO is being proposed for radar. The fundamental difference between statistical MIMO and other radar array systems is that the latter seek to maximize the coherent processing gain, while statistical MIMO radar capitalizes on the diversity of target scattering to improve radar performance. Coherent processing is made possible by highly correlated signals at the receiver array, whereas in statistical MIMO radar, the signals received by the array elements are uncorrelated. Radar targets generally consist of many small elemental scatterers that are fused by the radar waveform and the processing at the receiver, to result in echoes with fluctuating amplitude and phase. It is well known that in conventional radar, slow fluctuations of the target radar cross section (RCS) result in target fades that degrade radar performance. By spacing the antenna elements at the transmitter and at the receiver such that the target angular spread is manifested, the MIMO radar can exploit the spatial diversity of target scatterers opening the way to a variety of new techniques that can improve radar performance. This paper focuses on the application of the target spatial diversity to improve detection performance. The optimal detector in the Neyman–Pearson sense is developed and analyzed for the statistical MIMO radar. It is shown that the optimal detector consists of noncoherent processing of the receiver sensors' outputs and that for cases of practical interest, detection performance is superior to that obtained through coherent processing. An optimal detector invariant to the signal and noise levels is also developed and analyzed. In this case as well, statistical MIMO radar provides great improvements over other types of array radars.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2005.862813","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1597550","Array processing;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO);radar","Radar detection;Radar cross section;MIMO;Radar scattering;Radar antennas;Detectors;Signal processing;Proposals;Performance gain;Radar signal processing","","Array processing;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO);radar","","899","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Accurate and fast detection of this voltage component under grid faults is essential to keep the control over the power exchange with the grid avoiding to trip the converter protections and allowing the ride-through of the transient fault. In this paper, the systematic use of well known techniques conducts to a new positive-sequence voltage detection system which exhibits a fast, precise, and frequency-adaptive response under faulty grid conditions. Three fundamental functional blocks make up the proposed detector, these are: i) the quadrature-signals generator (QSG), ii) the positive-sequence calculator (PSC), and iii) the phase-locked loop (PLL). A key innovation of the proposed system is the use of a dual second order generalized integrator (DSOGI) to implement the QSG. For this reason, the proposed positive-sequence detector is called DSOGI-PLL. A detailed study of the DSOGI-PLL and verification by simulation are performed in this paper. From the obtained results, it can be concluded that the DSOGI-PLL is a very suitable technique for characterizing the positive-sequence voltage under grid faults.","2377-6617","0-7803-9716-9","10.1109/pesc.2006.1712059","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1712059","","Phase locked loops;Harmonic analysis;Wind power generation;Resonant frequency;Detectors;Transient analysis","","","","235","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To obtain zero steady-state error at the fundamental frequency (i.e., unity power factor), the use of a standard integrator in a rotating frame is as effective as the use of a resonant controller in a stationary frame. However, the grid voltage harmonics influence the current controller and generate current harmonics unless several integrators in multiple rotating frames or resonant compensators in a stationary frame are adopted. In this letter, a hybrid system consisting of a proportional integral (PI) controller plus a generic hth harmonic resonant controller implemented in a frame rotating at the n th harmonic frequency is discussed in detail. The hth  harmonic controller is able to decrease both the (h - n)th  and (h + n)th harmonics, while the PI controller is able to decrease other harmonics if the synchronization phase signal adopted for the frame transformation is unfiltered. It is demonstrated that the use of a PI and sixth harmonic resonant compensator is effective for both positive and negative sequence fifth and seventh harmonics; hence, four harmonics are compensated with the proportional integral-resonant (PI-RES) controller implemented in a synchronous frame.

However, space-time coding of the transmitted signals allows to digitally steer the beam pattern in the transmit in addition to the received signal. The ability to steer the transmitted beam pattern, helps to avoid beam shape loss. We show that the configuration with spatially orthogonal signal transmission is equivalent to additional virtual sensors which extend the array aperture with virtual spatial tapering. These virtual sensors can be used to form narrower beams with lower sidelobes and, therefore, provide higher performance in target detection, angular estimation accuracy, and angular resolution.

"Flyback-Type Single-Phase Utility Interactive Inverter With Power Pulsation Decoupling on the DC Input for an AC Photovoltaic Module System","T. Shimizu; K. Wada; N. Nakamura","Tokyo Metropolitan Univ.; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","","2006","21","5","1264","1272","In recent years, interest in natural energy has grown in response to increased concern for the environment. Many kinds of inverter circuits and their control schemes for photovoltaic (PV) power generation systems have been studied. A conventional system employs a PV array in which many PV modules are connected in series to obtain sufficient dc input voltage for generating ac utility line voltage from an inverter circuit. However, the total power generated from the PV array is sometimes decreased remarkably when only a few modules are partially covered by shadows, thereby decreasing inherent current generation, and preventing the generation current from attaining its maximum value on the array. To overcome this drawback, an ac module strategy has been proposed. In this system, a low-power dc-ac utility interactive inverter is individually mounted on each PV module and operates so as to generate the maximum power from its corresponding PV module. Especially in the case of a single-phase utility interactive inverter, an electrolytic capacitor of large capacitance has been connected on the dc input bus in order to decouple the power pulsation caused by single-phase power generation to the utility line. However, especially during the summer season, the ac module inverters have to operate under a very high atmospheric temperature, and hence the lifetime of the inverter is shortened, because the electrolytic capacitor has a drastically shortened life when used in a high-temperature environment. Of course, we may be able to use film capacitors instead of the electrolytic capacitors if we can pay for the extreme large volume of the inverter. However, this is not a realistic solution for ac module systems. This paper proposes a novel flyback-type utility interactive inverter circuit topology suitable for ac module systems when its lifetime under high atmospheric temperature is taken into account. A most distinctive feature of the proposed system is that the decoupling of power pulsation is executed by an additional circuit that enables employment of film capacitors with small capacitance not only for the dc input line but also for the decoupling circuit, and hence the additional circuit is expected to extend the lifetime of the inverter. The proposed inverter circuit also enables realization of small volume, lightweight, and stable ac current injection into the utility line. A control method suitable for the proposed inverter is also proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed inverter is verified thorough P-SIM simulation and experiments on a 100-W prototype","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2006.880247","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1687975","AC module;flyback inverter;photovoltaic (PV) power generation;utility interactive inverter","Inverters;Photovoltaic systems;Solar power generation;Circuits;Capacitors;Power generation;Voltage;Capacitance;Temperature;Control systems","DC-AC power convertors;invertors;photovoltaic power systems;power generation control","flyback-type single-phase utility interactive inverter;power pulsation decoupling;AC photovoltaic module system;photovoltaic power generation systems;PV arrays;DC-AC utility inverter","","330","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike the usual ""blind"" isotropic broadcasting scenario, the availability of CSI allows transmit optimization. A minimum transmission power criterion is adopted, subject to prescribed minimum received signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at each of the intended receivers. A related max-min SNR ""fair"" problem formulation is also considered subject to a transmitted power constraint. It is proven that both problems are NP-hard; however, suitable reformulation allows the successful application of semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques. SDR yields an approximate solution plus a bound on the optimum value of the associated cost/reward. SDR is motivated from a Lagrangian duality perspective, and its performance is assessed via pertinent simulations for the case of Rayleigh fading wireless channels. We find that SDR typically yields solutions that are within 3-4 dB of the optimum, which is often good enough in practice. In several scenarios, SDR generates exact solutions that meet the associated bound on the optimum value.

"A Novel Soft-Commutating Isolated Boost Full-Bridge ZVS-PWM DC–DC Converter for Bidirectional High Power Applications","L. Zhu","NA","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","","2006","21","2","422","429","A soft-commutating method and control scheme for an isolated boost full bridge converter is proposed in this paper to implement dual operation of the well-known soft-switching full bridge dc/dc buck converter for bidirectional high power applications. It provides a unique commutation logic to minimize a mismatch between current in the current-fed inductor and current in the leakage inductance of the transformer when commutation takes place, significantly reducing the power rating for a voltage clamping snubber and enabling use of a simple passive clamped snubber. To minimize the mismatch, the method and control scheme utilizes the resonant tank and freewheeling path in the existing full bridge inverter at the voltage-fed side to preset the current in the leakage inductance of the transformer in a resonant manner. Zero-voltage-switching is also achieved for all the switches at the voltage-fed side inverter in boost mode operation. The proposed soft-commutating method is verified through boost mode operation of a 3-kW bidirectional isolated full bridge dc/dc converter developed for fuel cell electric vehicle applications. The tested result verified the isolated boost converter can operate at an input voltage of 8.5–15V and an output voltage of 250–420V with a peak efficiency of 93% and an average efficiency of 88% at 55-kHz switching frequency with 72$^circ$C automotive coolant.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2005.869730","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1603674","Automotive dc/dc converter;bidirectional dc/dc converter;full bridge;isolated boost converter;soft-commutating;soft-switching","Bridge circuits;Inductance;Snubbers;Resonance;Inverters;Voltage;Buck converters;Logic;Inductors;Clamps","","Automotive dc/dc converter;bidirectional dc/dc converter;full bridge;isolated boost converter;soft-commutating;soft-switching","","225","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The optimization problem is numerically difficult to solve when the problem does not have a convexity structure. This paper makes progress toward solving optimization problems of this type by showing that under a certain condition called the time-sharing condition, the duality gap of the optimization problem is always zero, regardless of the convexity of the objective function. Further, we show that the time-sharing condition is satisfied for practical multiuser spectrum optimization problems in multicarrier systems in the limit as the number of carriers goes to infinity. This result leads to efficient numerical algorithms that solve the nonconvex problem in the dual domain. We show that the recently proposed optimal spectrum balancing algorithm for digital subscriber lines can be interpreted as a dual algorithm. This new interpretation gives rise to more efficient dual update methods. It also suggests ways in which the dual objective may be evaluated approximately, further improving the numerical efficiency of the algorithm.

In cloudy areas of the Earth, the problem is compounded, and researchers are fortunate to get two to three clear images per year. At the same time, the coarse resolution of sensors such as the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) limits the sensors' ability to quantify biophysical processes in heterogeneous landscapes. In this paper, the authors present a new spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) algorithm to blend Landsat and MODIS surface reflectance. Using this approach, high-frequency temporal information from MODIS and high-resolution spatial information from Landsat can be blended for applications that require high resolution in both time and space. The MODIS daily 500-m surface reflectance and the 16-day repeat cycle Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) 30-m surface reflectance are used to produce a synthetic ""daily"" surface reflectance product at ETM+ spatial resolution. The authors present results both with simulated (model) data and actual Landsat/MODIS acquisitions.

The local region descriptors are hierarchically quantized in a vocabulary tree. The vocabulary tree allows a larger and more discriminatory vocabulary to be used efficiently, which we show experimentally leads to a dramatic improvement in retrieval quality. The most significant property of the scheme is that the tree directly defines the quantization. The quantization and the indexing are therefore fully integrated, essentially being one and the same.

Among various modulation techniques for a multilevel inverter, the space vector pulsewidth modulation (SVPWM) is widely used. However, the implementation of the SVPWM for a multilevel inverter is complicated. The complexity is due to the difficulty in determining the location of the reference vector, the calculation of on-times, and the determination and selection of switching states. This paper proposes a general SVPWM algorithm for multilevel inverters based on standard two-level SVPWM. Since the proposed multilevel SVPWM method uses two-level modulation to calculate the on-times, the computation of on-times for an n-level inverter becomes easier. The proposed method uses a simple mapping to achieve the SVPWM for a multilevel inverter. A general n-level implementation is explained, and experimental results are given for three-level and five-level inverters","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2006.881989","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1705655","Multilevel inverter;neutral point clamped (NPC);space vector pulsewidth modulation (SVPWM);switching state;two-level inverter","Pulse width modulation inverters;Space vector pulse width modulation;Pulse inverters;Pulse modulation;Medium voltage;Control systems;Topology;Equations;Signal processing algorithms;Power system harmonics","PWM invertors;switching convertors","space vector PWM multilevel inverters;high-power medium voltage applications;two-level inverters;switching states;two-level modulation;neutral point clamping","","241","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This combination of DFE and FFE permits error-free NRZ signaling over channels with losses exceeding 30 dB. Low jitter clocks for the transmitter and receiver are supplied by a PLL with LC VCO. Operation at 10-Gb/s with good power efficiency is achieved by using half-rate architectures in both transmitter and receiver.

In opportunistic networks, mobile nodes are enabled to communicate with each other even if a route connecting them never exists. Furthermore, nodes are not supposed to possess or acquire any knowledge about the network topology, which (instead) is necessary in traditional MANET routing protocols. Routes are built dynamically, while messages are en route between the sender and the destination(s), and any possible node can opportunistically be used as next hop, provided it is likely to bring the message closer to the final destination. These requirements make opportunistic networks a challenging and promising research field. In this article we survey the most interesting case studies related to opportunistic networking and discuss and organize a taxonomy for the main routing and forwarding approaches in this challenging environment.

"New insights into the noise reduction Wiener filter","Jingdong Chen; J. Benesty; Yiteng Huang; S. Doclo","Lucent Technol. Bell Labs., Murray Hill, NJ, USA; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","","2006","14","4","1218","1234","The problem of noise reduction has attracted a considerable amount of research attention over the past several decades. Among the numerous techniques that were developed, the optimal Wiener filter can be considered as one of the most fundamental noise reduction approaches, which has been delineated in different forms and adopted in various applications. Although it is not a secret that the Wiener filter may cause some detrimental effects to the speech signal (appreciable or even significant degradation in quality or intelligibility), few efforts have been reported to show the inherent relationship between noise reduction and speech distortion. By defining a speech-distortion index to measure the degree to which the speech signal is deformed and two noise-reduction factors to quantify the amount of noise being attenuated, this paper studies the quantitative performance behavior of the Wiener filter in the context of noise reduction. We show that in the single-channel case the a posteriori signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (defined after the Wiener filter) is greater than or equal to the a priori SNR (defined before the Wiener filter), indicating that the Wiener filter is always able to achieve noise reduction. However, the amount of noise reduction is in general proportional to the amount of speech degradation. This may seem discouraging as we always expect an algorithm to have maximal noise reduction without much speech distortion. Fortunately, we show that speech distortion can be better managed in three different ways. If we have some a priori knowledge (such as the linear prediction coefficients) of the clean speech signal, this a priori knowledge can be exploited to achieve noise reduction while maintaining a low level of speech distortion. When no a priori knowledge is available, we can still achieve a better control of noise reduction and speech distortion by properly manipulating the Wiener filter, resulting in a suboptimal Wiener filter. In case that we have multiple microphone sensors, the multiple observations of the speech signal can be used to reduce noise with less or even no speech distortion","1558-7924","","10.1109/TSA.2005.860851","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1643650","Microphone arrays;noise reduction;speech distortion;Wiener filter","Noise reduction;Wiener filter;Speech enhancement;Acoustic distortion;Working environment noise;Acoustic noise;Signal to noise ratio;Degradation;Microphones;Automatic speech recognition","distortion;microphone arrays;sensors;signal denoising;speech processing;Wiener filters","noise reduction;Wiener filter;speech signal;speech distortion index;signal-to-noise ratio;SNR;speech degradation;multiple microphone sensors","","251","","56","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Measurements made across a temperature range of -40/spl deg/C to 125/spl deg/C and 94 samples collected over four fabrication runs indicate a worst case combined variation of /spl plusmn/2.6% (with process, temperature and supply). No trimming was performed on any of these samples. The oscillation frequencies of 95% of the samples were found to fall within /spl plusmn/0.5% of the mean frequency and the standard deviation was 9.3 kHz. The variation of frequency with power supply was /spl plusmn/0.31% for a supply voltage range of 2.4-2.75 V. The clock generator is based on a three-stage differential ring oscillator. The variation of the frequency of the oscillator with temperature and process has been discussed and an adaptive biasing scheme incorporating a unique combination of a process corner sensing scheme and a temperature compensating network is developed. The biasing circuit changes the control voltage of the differential ring oscillator to maintain a constant frequency. A comparator included at the output stage ensures rail-to-rail swing.

Due to the increasing power capability of the available generation systems, a three-level three-phase neutral-point-clamped voltage-source inverter is selected as the heart of the interfacing system. A multivariable control law is used for the regulator because of the intrinsic multivariable structure of the system. A current source (playing the role of a generic renewable energy source) is connected to the grid using a three-level inverter in order to verify the good performance of the proposed approach. Large- and small-signal d-q state-space averaged models of the system are obtained and used to calculate the multivariable controller based on the linear quadratic regulator technique. This controller simultaneously regulates the dc-link voltage (to operate at the maximum power point of the renewable energy source), the mains power factor (the power is delivered to the grid at unity power factor), and the dc-link neutral-point voltage balance. With the model and regulator presented, a specific switching strategy to control the dc-link neutral-point voltage is not required. The proposed controller can be used for any application, since its nature makes possible the control of any system variable. The good performance of the presented interfacing solution in both steady-state and transient operation is verified through simulation and experimentation using a 1-kW neutral-point-clamped voltage-source-inverter prototype, where a PC-embedded digital signal processor board is used for the controller implementation","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2006.882021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1705641","Distributed power generation;grid interface;multilevel conversion;multivariable control;photovoltaic power system;three-level inverter;wind power system","Renewable energy resources;Inverters;Control systems;Regulators;Voltage control;Power system modeling;Reactive power;Power generation;Heart;Steady-state","distributed power generation;invertors;multivariable control systems;power generation control;power grids;power system simulation;renewable energy sources;voltage control","renewable energy source;utility grid interface;three-level three-phase voltage-source inverter;multivariable control structure;d-q state-space averaged model;linear quadratic regulator;DC-link voltage regulation;power factor;steady-state operation;transient operation;power system simulation;PC-embedded digital signal processor board;distributed power generation;photovoltaic power system;wind power system;1 kW","","276","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a result, adaptive virtual output impedance is proposed in order to achieve a proper reactive power sharing, regardless of the line-impedance unbalances. A soft-start operation is also included, avoiding the initial current peak, which results in a seamless hot-swap operation. Active power sharing is achieved by adjusting the frequency in load transient situations only, owing to which the proposed method obtains a constant steady-state frequency and amplitude. As opposed to the conventional droop method, the transient response can be modified by acting on the main control parameters. Linear and nonlinear loads can be properly shared due to the addition of a current harmonic loop in the control strategy.

This approach is quite flexible, and permits recognition based on color, texture, and particularly shape, in a homogeneous framework. While nearest neighbor classifiers are natural in this setting, they suffer from the problem of high variance (in bias-variance decomposition) in the case of limited sampling. Alternatively, one could use support vector machines but they involve time-consuming optimization and computation of pairwise distances. We propose a hybrid of these two methods which deals naturally with the multiclass setting, has reasonable computational complexity both in training and at run time, and yields excellent results in practice. The basic idea is to find close neighbors to a query sample and train a local support vector machine that preserves the distance function on the collection of neighbors. Our method can be applied to large, multiclass data sets for which it outperforms nearest neighbor and support vector machines, and remains efficient when the problem becomes intractable for support vector machines. A wide variety of distance functions can be used and our experiments show state-of-the-art performance on a number of benchmark data sets for shape and texture classification (MNIST, USPS, CUReT) and object recognition (Caltech- 101). On Caltech-101 we achieved a correct classification rate of 59.05%(±0.56%) at 15 training images per class, and 66.23%(±0.48%) at 30 training images.","1063-6919","0-7695-2597-0","10.1109/CVPR.2006.301","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1641014","","Nearest neighbor searches;Shape;Humans;Support vector machines;Prototypes;Support vector machine classification;Computer vision;Pattern recognition;Computer science;Sampling methods","","","","476","","42","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is helpful in music understanding, music retrieval, and some other music-related applications. In this paper, a hierarchical framework is presented to automate the task of mood detection from acoustic music data, by following some music psychological theories in western cultures. The hierarchical framework has the advantage of emphasizing the most suitable features in different detection tasks. Three feature sets, including intensity, timbre, and rhythm are extracted to represent the characteristics of a music clip. The intensity feature set is represented by the energy in each subband, the timbre feature set is composed of the spectral shape features and spectral contrast features, and the rhythm feature set indicates three aspects that are closely related with an individual's mood response, including rhythm strength, rhythm regularity, and tempo. Furthermore, since mood is usually changeable in an entire piece of classical music, the approach to mood detection is extended to mood tracking for a music piece, by dividing the music into several independent segments, each of which contains a homogeneous emotional expression. Preliminary evaluations indicate that the proposed algorithms produce satisfactory results. On our testing database composed of 800 representative music clips, the average accuracy of mood detection achieves up to 86.3%. We can also on average recall 84.1% of the mood boundaries from nine testing music pieces.","1558-7924","","10.1109/TSA.2005.860344","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1561259","Affective computing;hierarchical framework;mood detection;mood tracking;music emotion;music information retrieval;music mood","Mood;Multiple signal classification;Rhythm;Acoustic signal detection;Timbre;Testing;Music information retrieval;Psychology;Computer vision;Data mining","music;acoustic signal detection;feature extraction;audio signal processing","automatic music mood detection;music audio signal tracking;music clip emotional expression;music understanding;music retrieval;intensity feature set;timbre feature set;rhythm feature set;spectral shape features;spectral contrast features;rhythm strength;rhythm regularity;tempo","","238","","44","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We address the drawbacks of the conventional watershed algorithm when it is applied to medical images by using k-means clustering to produce a primary segmentation of the image before we apply our improved watershed segmentation algorithm to it. The k-means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm, while the improved watershed segmentation algorithm makes use of automated thresholding on the gradient magnitude map and post-segmentation merging on the initial partitions to reduce the number of false edges and over-segmentation.

There is an increasing interest in this subject since, on one hand, emerging broadband wireless access networks and standards spanning from universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) to fixed access picocellular networks and including wireless local area network (WLAN), World Interoperability for Microwave Access, Inc. (WIMAX), local multipoint distribution service (LMDS), etc., require an increase in capacity by reducing the coverage area. An enabling technology to obtain this objective is based on radio-over-fiber (RoF) systems where signal processing is carried at a central office to where signals are carried from inexpensive remote antenna units (RAUs). On the other hand, microwave photonic filters can find applications in specialized fields such as radar and photonic beamsteering of phased-arrayed antennas, where dynamical reconfiguration is an added value.

Using this method, the Vth of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs can be continuously shifted from -4 V in a conventional depletion-mode (D-mode) AlGaN/GaN HEMT to 0.9 V in an enhancement-mode AlGaN/GaN HEMT. It was found that the plasma-induced damages result in a mobility degradation of two-dimensional electron gas. The damages can be repaired and the mobility can be recovered by a post-gate annealing step at 400 degC. At the same time, the shift in Vth shows a good thermal stability and is not affected by the post-gate annealing. The enhancement-mode HEMTs show a performance (transconductance, cutoff frequencies) comparable to the D-mode HEMTs. Experimental results confirm that the threshold-voltage shift originates from the incorporation of F ions in the AlGaN barrier. In addition, the fluoride-based plasma treatment was also found to be effective in lowering the gate-leakage current, in both forward and reverse bias regions.

Two types of development can reduce the cost dramatically. The first is via the improvement of physical-link communication efficiency by an order of magnitude using photon-counting receivers for vacuum channels, system complexity, weight, and power for space systems can be greatly reduced.

To replace the sensor, information on the rotor speed is extracted from measured stator currents and from voltages at motor terminals. Vector-controlled drives require estimating the magnitude and spatial orientation of the fundamental magnetic flux waves in the stator or in the rotor. Open-loop estimators or closed-loop observers are used for this purpose. They differ with respect to accuracy, robustness, and sensitivity against model parameter variations. Dynamic performance and steady-state speed accuracy around zero speed range are achieved by signal injection, exploiting the anisotropic properties of the machine.

The result is a flexible multiscale, multidirection, and shift-invariant image decomposition that can be efficiently implemented via the a trous algorithm. At the core of the proposed scheme is the nonseparable two-channel nonsubsampled filter bank (NSFB). We exploit the less stringent design condition of the NSFB to design filters that lead to a NSCT with better frequency selectivity and regularity when compared to the contourlet transform. We propose a design framework based on the mapping approach, that allows for a fast implementation based on a lifting or ladder structure, and only uses one-dimensional filtering in some cases. In addition, our design ensures that the corresponding frame elements are regular, symmetric, and the frame is close to a tight one.

The proposed system includes a reconfigurable rectangular spiral antenna with a set of micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) switches, which are monolithically integrated and packaged onto the same substrate. The system is based on a single-arm rectangular spiral antenna, capable of changing its radiation pattern using radio frequency-MEMS (RF-MEMS) switches. The rectangular spiral and RF-MEMS switches are monolithically integrated on a conventional microwave substrate printed circuit board (/spl epsiv//sub r/=3.27 and tan/spl delta/=0.004) and quartz substrate (/spl epsiv//sub r/=3.78 and tan/spl delta/=0.0002). The spiral is made out of multiple lines, which are interconnected by RF-MEMS switches strategically located along the spiral. On activating these switches, the spiral overall arm length is changed and consequently its radiation beam direction is changed. The two proposed antennas radiate right hand circular polarization (RHCP) and left hand circular polarization (LHCP) for printed circuit board and quartz substrate respectively. The gain of the two antennas varies between 3/spl sim/6 dBi. They both satisfy the 3-dB axial ratio criterion at their operating frequency band, i.e., at 10 GHz and 6 GHz for the printed circuit board and the quartz substrate respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first truly reconfigurable printed antenna design using MEMS devices as active elements integrated in the same low loss substrate. The excellent performance of the proposed system emphasizes the importance of being able to integrate MEMS switches into the same low loss substrate for antenna applications. This technology pioneers the design of arbitrarily shaped reconfigurable antennas including the design of reconfigurable antenna arrays.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2005.863407","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1589415","Circular polarization;micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) antenna;monolithic integration;PCB substrate;quartz substrate;radio frequency-micro electro mechanical system (RF-MEMS) capacitive series switch;reconfigurable scan-beam;smart antenna;spiral antenna","Spirals;Radiofrequency microelectromechanical systems;Switches;Printed circuits;Polarization;Mechanical systems;Micromechanical devices;Packaging;Antenna radiation patterns;Radio frequency","scanning antennas;spiral antennas;microswitches;MMIC;microwave switches;antenna radiation patterns;microstrip antenna arrays;electromagnetic wave polarisation;active antenna arrays;capacitor switching;adaptive antenna arrays;printed circuit design;quartz","reconfigurable scan-beam antenna;single-arm spiral antenna;rectangular antenna;micro electro mechanical system;RF-MEMS switch;monolithically integrated solution;radiation pattern;printed circuit board;quartz substrate;right hand circular polarization;RHCP radiation;left hand circular polarization;LHCP;printed antenna design;active element;capacitive series switch;smart antenna","","189","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Relations are given between items, and a hierarchy is defined on the items as well. We present a new method for visualizing such compound graphs. Our approach is based on visually bundling the adjacency edges, i.e., non-hierarchical edges, together. We realize this as follows. We assume that the hierarchy is shown via a standard tree visualization method. Next, we bend each adjacency edge, modeled as a B-spline curve, toward the polyline defined by the path via the inclusion edges from one node to another. This hierarchical bundling reduces visual clutter and also visualizes implicit adjacency edges between parent nodes that are the result of explicit adjacency edges between their respective child nodes. Furthermore, hierarchical edge bundling is a generic method which can be used in conjunction with existing tree visualization techniques. We illustrate our technique by providing example visualizations and discuss the results based on an informal evaluation provided by potential users of such visualizations","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2006.147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4015425","Network visualization;edge bundling;edge aggregation;edge concentration;curves;graph visualization;tree visualization;node-link diagrams;hierarchies;treemaps.","Data visualization;Tree graphs;Wires;Cables;Spline;Software systems;Social network services;Displays;Tree data structures","curve fitting;data visualisation;splines (mathematics);tree data structures;trees (mathematics)","hierarchical edge bundles;adjacency relation visualization;hierarchical data;compound graph;tree visualization method;B-spline curve;visual clutter","","483","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We assume time-division duplex (TDD) operation, so the base station derives its channel estimate from taurp pilot symbols which the terminals transmit on the reverse link. A coherence interval of T symbols is expended as follows: taurp reverse pilot symbols, one symbol for computations, and (T-l-taurp) forward QAM symbols for each terminal For a given coherence interval, number of base station antennas, and forward- and reverse-SINR's we determine the optimum number of terminals to serve simultaneously and the optimum number of reverse pilot symbols to employ by choosing these parameters to maximize a lower bound on the net sum-throughput. The lower bound rigorously accounts for channel estimation error, and is valid for all SINR's. Surprisingly it is always advantageous to increase the number of base station antennas, even when the reverse SINR is low and the channel estimate poor: greater numbers of antennas enable us to climb out of the noise and to serve more terminals. Even within short coherence intervals (T= 10 symbols) and with low SINR's (-10.0 dB reverse, 0.0 dB forward) given large numbers of base station antennas (M ges 16 ) it is both feasible and advantageous to learn the channel and to serve a multiplicity of terminals simultaneously as well.","1058-6393","1-4244-0784-2","10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354768","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4176578","","MIMO;Base stations;Broadcasting;Signal to noise ratio;Linear antenna arrays;Quadrature amplitude modulation;Receiving antennas;Throughput;Downlink;Channel estimation","antenna arrays;channel estimation;MIMO communication;multi-access systems","multiuser MIMO;M-element antenna array;autonomous single-antenna terminals;linear pre-coder;pseudo-inverse;forward channel matrix;time-division duplex operation;channel estimate;reverse pilot symbols;channel estimation error;multiple input multiple output systems","","264","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Assuming Gaussian inputs we also derive tight lower bounds of ergodic and outage capacities and optimal transmitter power allocation strategies that achieve the bounds under perfect feedback. For the ergodic capacity, the optimal strategy is a modified waterfilling over the spatial (antenna) and temporal (fading) domains. This strategy is close to optimum under small feedback delays, but when the delay is large, equal powers should be allocated across spatial dimensions. For the outage capacity, the optimal scheme is a spatial waterfilling and temporal truncated channel inversion. Numerical results show that some capacity gain is obtained by spatial power allocation. Temporal power adaptation, on the other hand, gives negligible gain in terms of ergodic capacity, but greatly enhances outage performance.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2006.872984","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1624653","Capacity;channel estimation error;feedback delay;multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO);mutual information;outage capacity;power allocation;waterfilling","Fading;MIMO;Channel estimation;Mutual information;Transmitters;Feedback;Upper bound;Performance gain;Delay estimation;Signal to noise ratio","MIMO systems;fading channels;channel estimation;channel capacity","multiple-input-multiple-output channel;fading MIMO channel;channel estimation error;ergodic capacity;outage capacity;optimal transmitter power allocation strategy;spatial waterfilling;temporal truncated channel inversion","","494","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

If the shares are xeroxed onto transparencies, the secret image can be visually decoded by superimposing a qualified subset of transparencies, but no secret information can be obtained from the superposition of a forbidden subset. The binary patterns of the n shares, however, have no visual meaning and hinder the objectives of visual cryptography. Extended visual cryptography was proposed recently to construct meaningful binary images as shares using hypergraph colourings, but the visual quality is poor. In this paper, a novel technique named halftone visual cryptography is proposed to achieve visual cryptography via halftoning. Based on the blue-noise dithering principles, the proposed method utilizes the void and cluster algorithm to encode a secret binary image into n halftone shares (images) carrying significant visual information.

When wind energy development began, wind power plants were very small, ranging in size from under one megawatt to tens megawatts with less than 100 turbines in each plant. Thus, the impact of wind power plant on the grid was very small, and any disturbance within or created by the plant was considered to be in the noise level. In the past 30 years, the size of wind turbines and the size of wind power plants have increased significantly. Notably, in Tehachapi, California, the amount of wind power generation has surpassed the infrastructure for which it was designed. At the same time, the lack of rules, standards, and regulations during early wind development has proven to be an increasing threat to the stability and power quality of the grid connected to a wind power plant. Fortunately, many new wind power plants are equipped with state of the art technology, which enables them to provide good service while producing clean power for the grid. The advances in power electronics have allowed many power system applications to become more flexible and to accomplish smoother regulation. Applications such as reactive power compensation, static transfer switches, energy storage, and variable-speed generations are commonly found in modern wind power plants. Although many operational aspects affect wind power plant operation, this paper, focuses on power quality. Because a wind power plant is connected to the grid, it is very important to understand the sources of disturbances that affect the power quality. In general, the voltage and frequency must be kept as stable as possible. The voltage and current distortions created by harmonics are also discussed in this paper as self-excitation, which may occur in a wind power plant due to loss of line","1932-5517","1-4244-0493-2","10.1109/PES.2006.1709244","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1709244","wind turbine;wind farm;wind power plant;power quality;wind energy;aggregation;power systems;renewable energy;reactive power compensation;self-excitation;harmonics","Power quality;Wind energy;Power system stability;Power system reliability;Power generation;Wind turbines;Voltage;Noise level;Wind power generation;Standards development","power generation faults;power generation reliability;power supply quality;power system stability;wind power plants;wind turbines","wind power plant;power quality aspects;power system reliability;power system stability;wind energy development;wind turbines;Tehachapi;California;wind power generation;reactive power compensation;static transfer switches;energy storage;variable-speed generations;voltage distortions;current distortions;line losses","","47","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To identify the camera from a given image, we consider the reference pattern noise as a spread-spectrum watermark, whose presence in the image is established by using a correlation detector. Experiments on approximately 320 images taken with nine consumer digital cameras are used to estimate false alarm rates and false rejection rates.

Spherical shells of homogenous, isotropic negative permittivity (ENG) material are designed to create electrically small resonant systems for several antennas: an infinitesimal electric dipole, a very short center-fed cylindrical electric dipole, and a very short coaxially-fed electric monopole over an infinite ground plane. Analytical and numerical models demonstrate that a properly designed ENG shell provides a distributed inductive element resonantly matched to these highly capacitive electrically small antennas, i.e., an ENG shell can be designed to produce an electrically small system with a zero input reactance and an input resistance that is matched to a specified source resistance leading to overall efficiencies approaching unity. Losses and dispersion characteristics of the ENG materials are also included in the analytical models. Finite element numerical models of the various antenna-ENG shell systems are developed and used to predict their input impedances. These electrically small antenna-ENG shell systems with idealized dispersionless ENG material properties are shown to be very efficient and to have fractional bandwidths above the values associated with the Chu limit for the quality factor without any degradation in the radiation patterns of the antennas. Introducing dispersion and losses into the analytical models, the resulting bandwidths are shown to be reduced significantly, but remain slightly above (below) the corresponding Chu-based value for an energy-based limiting (Drude) dispersion model of the permittivity of the ENG shell.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2006.877179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1650411","antenna theory;Chu limit;complex media;electrically small antennas;electromagnetic theory;metamaterials","Dipole antennas;Analytical models;Permittivity;Bandwidth;Metamaterials;Dispersion","antenna feeds;antenna radiation patterns;dipole antenna arrays;dispersion (wave);finite element analysis;metamaterials","Chu limit;analytical model;antenna-ENG shell system;center-fed cylindrical electric dipole;coaxially-fed electric monopole;dispersion characteristic;electrically small antenna;finite element numerical model;infinitesimal electric dipole;metamaterial parad","","322","","46","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Modern studies can include multiple labels defined on multiple images yet most evaluation schemes report one overlap per labelled region, simply averaged over multiple images. In this paper, common overlap measures are generalized to measure the total overlap of ensembles of labels defined on multiple test images and account for fractional labels using fuzzy set theory. This framework allows a single ""figure-of-merit"" to be reported which summarises the results of a complex experiment by image pair, by label or overall. A complementary measure of error, the overlap distance, is defined which captures the spatial extent of the nonoverlapping part and is related to the Hausdorff distance computed on grey level images. The generalized overlap measures are validated on synthetic images for which the overlap can be computed analytically and used as similarity measures in nonrigid registration of three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain images. Finally, a pragmatic segmentation ground truth is constructed by registering a magnetic resonance atlas brain to 20 individual scans, and used with the overlap measures to evaluate publicly available brain segmentation algorithms","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2006.880587","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1717643","Fuzzy sets;Hausdorff distance;morphological operations;registration;segmentation;validation","Biomedical imaging;Image analysis;Image segmentation;Magnetic resonance imaging;Image registration;Testing;Fuzzy set theory;Magnetic analysis;Brain;Magnetic resonance","biomedical MRI;brain;fuzzy set theory;image registration;image segmentation;medical image processing;neurophysiology","generalized overlap measures;medical image analysis;Dice coefficient;Tanimoto coefficient;image registration;segmentation algorithms;multiple test images;fractional labels;fuzzy set theory;error measure;overlap distance;Hausdorff distance;grey level images;nonrigid registration;three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging;brain images;pragmatic segmentation;ground truth;magnetic resonance atlas brain","Algorithms;Brain;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Quality Assurance, Health Care;Quality Assurance, Health Care;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","265","","44","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Each mode generates a different thermometer output, i.e. a different switching sequence for the DAC MSB thermometer analog elements. This results in two different transfer characteristics of the whole DAC for the same mismatch errors of its elements. After on-chip or off-chip measurements, the more linear transfer characteristic can be selected. In this way, chip yield is improved and the design requirements can be relaxed.

In the proposed current-mode control method, the inductor current is sampled only once in a switching period. A compensating ramp is used in the modulator to determine the switching instant. The slope of the compensating ramp is determined analytically from the steady-state stability condition. The proposed digital current-mode control is not predictive, therefore the trajectory of the inductor current during the switching period is not estimated in this method, and as a result the computational burden on the digital controller is significantly reduced. It therefore effectively increases the maximum switching frequency of the converter when a particular digital signal processor is used to implement the control algorithm. It is shown that the proposed digital method is versatile enough to implement any one of the average, peak, and valley current mode controls by adjustment of the sampling instant of the inductor current with respect to the turn-on instant of the switch.

We then describe key lessons learned and the main obstacles in extending the work to general resource allocation problems for multihop wireless networks. Towards this end, we show that a clean-slate optimization-based approach to the multihop resource allocation problem naturally results in a ""loosely coupled"" cross-layer solution. That is, the algorithms obtained map to different layers [transport, network, and medium access control/physical (MAC/PHY)] of the protocol stack, and are coupled through a limited amount of information being passed back and forth. It turns out that the optimal scheduling component at the MAC layer is very complex, and thus needs simpler (potentially imperfect) distributed solutions.

We propose a new edge-guided nonlinear interpolation technique through directional filtering and data fusion. For a pixel to be interpolated, two observation sets are defined in two orthogonal directions, and each set produces an estimate of the pixel value. These directional estimates, modeled as different noisy measurements of the missing pixel are fused by the linear minimum mean square-error estimation (LMMSE) technique into a more robust estimate, using the statistics of the two observation sets. We also present a simplified version of the LMMSE-based interpolation algorithm to reduce computational cost without sacrificing much the interpolation performance.

Dual-frequency operation is achieved by loading a slot antenna with two lumped variable capacitors (varactors) placed in proper locations along the slot. Loading the slot antenna with lumped capacitors shifts down the resonant frequencies of the first and second resonances of the antenna. However, these frequency shifts depend not only on the values of the capacitors, but also on their locations along the slot antenna. Here, it is shown that by choosing the locations of the varactors appropriately, it is possible to obtain a dual-band antenna whose first and second resonant frequencies can be controlled individually. In other words, the frequency of either the first or the second band can be fixed, while the other one is electronically tuned. Using such a design, an electronically tunable dual-band antenna is designed and fabricated using two identical varactors having a capacitance range of 0.5-2.25 pF. The antenna is shown to have a frequency ratio (f/sub R/=f/sub 2//f/sub 1/) ranging from 1.3 to 2.67. An important feature of this antenna is its consistent radiation pattern, polarization, and polarization purity at both bands and across its entire tunable frequency range.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2005.863412","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1589409","Multifrequency antennas;multiple band antennas;reconfigurable antennas;slot antennas","Dual band;Slot antennas;Loaded antennas;Capacitors;Varactors;Resonant frequency;Polarization;Resonance;Capacitance;Antenna radiation patterns","multifrequency antennas;slot antennas;varactors;antenna radiation patterns;electromagnetic wave polarisation","dual-band reconfigurable slot antenna;lumped variable capacitor;varactor;electronic tuning;radiation pattern;polarization;multifrequency antenna;0.5 to 2.25 pF","","234","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, there is a heavy educational burden even to using an IT2 FLS. This burden has to do with first having to learn general T2 FS mathematics, and then specializing it to an IT2 FSs. In retrospect, we believe that requiring a person to use T2 FS mathematics represents a barrier to the use of an IT2 FLS. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is unnecessary to take the route from general T2 FS to IT2 FS, and that all of the results that are needed to implement an IT2 FLS can be obtained using T1 FS mathematics.

Both oversampling and undersampling are considered. These techniques modify the distribution of the training data such that the costs of the examples are conveyed explicitly by the appearances of the examples. Threshold-moving tries to move the output threshold toward inexpensive classes such that examples with higher costs become harder to be misclassified. Moreover, hard-ensemble and soft-ensemble, i.e., the combination of above techniques via hard or soft voting schemes, are also tested. Twenty-one UCl data sets with three types of cost matrices and a real-world cost-sensitive data set are used in the empirical study. The results suggest that cost-sensitive learning with multiclass tasks is more difficult than with two-class tasks, and a higher degree of class imbalance may increase the difficulty. It also reveals that almost all the techniques are effective on two-class tasks, while most are ineffective and even may cause negative effect on multiclass tasks. Overall, threshold-moving and soft-ensemble are relatively good choices in training cost-sensitive neural networks. The empirical study also suggests that some methods that have been believed to be effective in addressing the class imbalance problem may, in fact, only be effective on learning with imbalanced two-class data sets.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2006.17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1549828","Index Terms- Machine learning;data mining;neural networks;cost-sensitive learning;class imbalance learning;sampling;threshold-moving;ensemble learning.","Neural networks;Costs;Machine learning;Learning systems;Data mining;Decision trees;Sampling methods;Testing;Training data;Voting","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;sampling methods","threshold-moving;cost-sensitive neural network training;oversampling technique;undersampling technique;cost-sensitive learning;machine learning;data mining;class imbalance learning;ensemble learning","","556","","39","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A block of information bits is mapped into a constellation point in the signal and the spatial domain, i.e. into the location of a particular antenna. The receiver estimates the transmitted signal and the transmit antenna number and uses the two information to de-map the block of information bits. For this purpose, a novel transmit antenna number detection algorithm called iterative-maximum ratio combining (i-MRC) is presented. Spatial modulation is used to transmit different number of information bits and i-MRC is used to estimate both the transmitted signal and the transmit antenna number. The results are compared to ideal V-BLAST (vertical-Bell Lab layered space-time) and to MRC. Spatial modulation outperforms MRC. The (bit-error-ratio) BER performance and the achieved spectral efficiency is comparable to V-BLAST.

However, the electric vehicle suffers from relatively short range and long charging times and consequently has not become an acceptable solution to the automotive consumer. The addition of an internal combustion engine to extend the range of the electric vehicle is one method of exploiting the high efficiency and lack of emissions of the electric vehicle while retaining the range and convenient refueling times of a conventional gasoline powered vehicle. The term that describes this type of vehicle is a hybrid electric vehicle. Many configurations of hybrid electric vehicles have been designed and implemented, namely the series, parallel and power-split configurations. This paper describes parallel hybrid electric vehicles that are battery dominant and have the ability to externally recharge from the wall socket. Both component selection and control strategy is discussed. Additionally, a definition of the degree of hybridization, or a description of the relative size of the electric motor to the internal combustion engine is presented. Finally the discussion will illustrate that an increasing degree of hybridization leads to higher overall vehicle efficiency, namely fuel and energy economy.","","0-7803-9793-2","10.1109/ICEHV.2006.352291","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4156566","Hybrid Electric Vehicle;nickel metal hydride;parallel HEV;passenger car;truck","Hybrid electric vehicles;Internal combustion engines;Batteries;Ice;Petroleum;Electric motors;Automotive engineering;Fuels;Educational institutions;Transportation","battery powered vehicles;electric motors;fuel economy;hybrid electric vehicles;internal combustion engines;lead acid batteries;road vehicles;transportation","plug-in hybrid electric vehicles;emission regulations;transportation;internal combustion engine;parallel configuration;parallel hybrid electric vehicles;battery dominant vehicles;external recharge;wall socket;electric motor;vehicle efficiency;fuel economy;energy economy;nickel metal hydride;passenger car;truck","","12","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the required sensitivity is very demanding since any individual radio might face a deep fade. We propose light-weight cooperation in sensing based on hard decisions to mitigate the sensitivity requirements on individual radios. We show that the ""link budget"" that system designers have to reserve for fading is a significant function of the required probability of detection. Even a few cooperating users (~10-20) facing independent fades are enough to achieve practical threshold levels by drastically reducing individual detection requirements. Hard decisions perform almost as well as soft decisions in achieving these gains. Cooperative gains in a environment where shadowing is correlated, is limited by the cooperation footprint (area in which users cooperate). In essence, a few independent users are more robust than many correlated users. Unfortunately, cooperative gain is very sensitive to adversarial/failing Cognitive Radios. Radios that fail in a known way (always report the presence/absence of a Primary user) can be compensated for by censoring them. On the other hand, radios that fail in unmodeled ways or may be malicious, introduce a bound on achievable sensitivity reductions. As a rule of thumb, if we believe that 1/N users can fail in an unknown way, then the cooperation gains are limited to what is possible with N trusted users.","1938-1883","1-4244-0355-3","10.1109/ICC.2006.254957","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4024390","","Cognitive radio;Radio spectrum management;Shadow mapping;Frequency measurement;Computer science;Face detection;Fading;Performance gain;Robustness;Thumb","","","","898","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The designed antenna is fabricated on an FR-4 printed-circuit-board substrate. The measured input standing-wave-ratio (SWR) is less than three from 2.40 to 2.483 GHz. As desired, the horizontal-polarization H-plane pattern is quite omnidirectional and the E-plane pattern is also very close to that of an ideal dipole antenna. Also a comparison with the popular printed inverted-F antenna (PIFA) has been conducted, the measured H-plane pattern of the Alford-loop-structure antenna is better than that of the PIFA when the omnidirectional pattern is desired. Further more, the study of the antenna printed on a simulated PCMCIA card and that inserted inside a laptop PC are also conducted. The HFSS model of a laptop PC housing, consisting of the display, the screen, and the metallic box with the keyboard, is constructed. The effect of the laptop PC housing with different angle between the display and keyboard on the antenna is also investigated. It is found that there is about 15 dB attenuation of the gain pattern (horizontal-polarization field) in the opposite direction of the PCMCIA slot on the laptop PC. Hence, the effect of the large ground plane of the PCMCIA card and the attenuation effect of the laptop PC housing should be taken into consideration for the antenna design for WLAN applications.

Eng., Imperial Coll., London","IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","","2006","53","5","1471","1482","Inverters are a necessary interface for several forms of distributed generation (DG) and where they form a microgrid they have the potential to offer high power quality. The challenge is to coordinate the actions of a group of inverters so that they offer the level of power quality known to be possible from fast local control of a single inverter. The case examined here is a power park of several inverter-based DG in relatively close proximity. A basic requirement is that the inverters regulate the grid voltage and share the real and reactive power demands according to their ratings. In small girds with high proportions of nonlinear and unbalanced loads it is also important to actively control the waveform quality in terms of harmonics, transient disturbances, and balance. Further, it is important that these duties are shared equally between the units rather than having one master unit taking the lead in the voltage control function. A constraint faced in designing a sharing system is the limited bandwidth of signal communication even over distances of a few meters. A control method is proposed that separates the control tasks in the frequency domain. Power sharing and voltage regulation are controlled centrally and commands are distributed through a low-bandwidth communication link. Waveform quality functions are controlled in high bandwidth controllers distributed to each local inverter. Experimental tests on a grid of three 10-kVA inverters are used to show that the method fully exploits the inherent fast response of the inverters while also ensuring voltage balance even with extreme load imbalance. It is shown that circulating currents are avoided during steady state and transients","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2006.882019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1705638","Distributed generation (DG);inverter;microgrid;power quality","Distributed power generation;Distributed control;Inverters;Communication system control;Voltage control;Power quality;Bandwidth;Reactive power;Proportional control;Signal design","distributed control;distributed power generation;frequency-domain analysis;power distribution control;power grids;power supply quality;reactive power;telecommunication links;voltage control","high power quality power generation;distributed control;power park microgrid;inverters;distributed generation;voltage regulation;reactive power demands;harmonics;transient disturbances;signal communication;frequency domain method;power sharing;low-bandwidth communication link;10 kVA","","224","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hourly forecasts up to 72-h ahead are produced for a wind park on the Greek island of Crete. As inputs our models use the numerical forecasts of wind speed and direction provided by atmospheric modeling system SKIRON for four nearby positions up to 30 km away from the wind turbine cluster. Three types of local recurrent neural networks are employed as forecasting models, namely, the infinite impulse response multilayer perceptron (IIR-MLP), the local activation feedback multilayer network (LAF-MLN), and the diagonal recurrent neural network (RNN). These networks contain internal feedback paths, with the neuron connections implemented by means of IIR synaptic filters. Two novel and optimal on-line learning schemes are suggested for the update of the recurrent network's weights based on the recursive prediction error algorithm. The methods assure continuous stability of the network during the learning phase and exhibit improved performance compared to the conventional dynamic back propagation. Extensive experimentation is carried out where the three recurrent networks are additionally compared to two static models, a finite-impulse response NN (FIR-NN) and a conventional static-MLP network. Simulation results demonstrate that the recurrent models, trained by the suggested methods, outperform the static ones while they exhibit significant improvement over the persistent method.","1558-0059","","10.1109/TEC.2005.847954","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1597347","Local recurrent neural networks;long-term wind power forecasting;nonlinear recursive least square learning;real time learning","Wind speed;Wind forecasting;Recurrent neural networks;Predictive models;Weather forecasting;Atmospheric modeling;IIR filters;Neurofeedback;Meteorology;Numerical models","load forecasting;recurrent neural nets;wind turbines;multilayer perceptrons;power engineering computing;IIR filters;FIR filters","long-term wind speed numerical forecasting;power forecasting;local recurrent neural network models;meteorological information;wind park;atmospheric modeling system;turbine cluster;infinite impulse response multilayer perceptron;local activation feedback multilayer network;diagonal recurrent neural network;optimal online learning schemes;recursive prediction error algorithm","","306","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At the receiver, a phase-diversity homodyne detection scheme is employed without locking the phase of the local oscillator (LO). To handle the carrier phase drift, the carrier phase is estimated with digital signal processing (DSP) on the homodyne-detected signal. Such a scheme presents the following major advantages over the conventional optical differential detection. First, its bit error rate (BER) performance is better than that of differential detection. This higher sensitivity can extend the reach of unrepeated transmission systems and reduce crosstalk between multiwavelength channels. Second, the optoelectronic conversion process is linear, so that the whole optical signal information can be postprocessed in the electrical domain. Third, this scheme is applicable to multilevel modulation formats such as M-array PSK and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). The performance of the receiver is evaluated through various simulations and experiments. As a result, an unrepeated transmission over 210 km with a 20-Gb/s optical QPSK signal is achieved. Moreover, in wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) environment, coherent detection allows the filtering of a desired wavelength channel to reside entirely in the electrical domain, taking advantage of the sharp cutoff characteristics of electrical filters. The experiments show the feasibility to transmit polarization-multiplexed 40-Gb/s QPSK signals over 200 km with channel spacing of 16 GHz, leading to a spectral efficiency as high as 2.5 b/s/Hz.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2005.860477","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1589027","Optical fiber communication;phase modulation","Optical detectors;Phase detection;Phase shift keying;Phase estimation;Optical receivers;Optical filters;Optical crosstalk;Optical sensors;Optical signal processing;Quadrature phase shift keying","quadrature phase shift keying;phase estimation;optical receivers;demodulation;optical fibre communication;homodyne detection;error statistics;optical crosstalk;optical modulation;wavelength division multiplexing;filtering theory;optical fibre polarisation;channel spacing","coherent detection;optical quadrature phase-shift keying;phase-shift keying signals;carrier phase estimation;coherent optical receiver;demodulation;phase-diversity homodyne detection;local oscillator;carrier phase drift;digital signal processing;bit error rate;sensitivity;unrepeated transmission systems;crosstalk reduction;multiwavelength channels;optoelectronic conversion;optical signal information;electrical domain;multilevel modulation formats;M -array PSK;quadrature amplitude modulation;harp cutoff characteristics;electrical filters;polarization-multiplexed signal;channel spacing;210 km;20 Gbit/s;40 Gbit/s;200 km","","279","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The technology offers several benefits that enable scaling to sub-30-nm gate lengths including extremely low parasitic S/D resistance (1% of the total device resistance), atomically abrupt junctions that enable the physical scaling of the device to sub-10-nm gate lengths, superior control of OFF-state leakage current due to the intrinsic Schottky potential barrier, and elimination of parasitic bipolar action. These and other benefits accrue using a low-thermal-budget CMOS manufacturing process requiring two fewer masks than conventional bulk CMOS. The SB-CMOS manufacturing process enables integration of critical new materials such as high-k gate insulators and strained silicon substrates. SB MOSFET technology state of the art is also reviewed, and shown to be focused on barrier-height-lowering techniques that use interfacial layers between the metal S/Ds and the channel region. SB-PMOS devices tend to have superior performance compared to NMOS, but NMOS performance has recently improved by using ytterbium silicide or by using hybrid structures that incorporate interfacial layers to lower the SB height.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2006.871842","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1624684","CMOSFETs;erbium silicide;metal source/drain (S/D);platinum silicide;Schottky barriers (SBs);short-channel MOSFET;transistors","MOSFETs;Semiconductor device manufacture;Schottky barriers;Ytterbium compounds;Erbium compounds","MOSFET;semiconductor device manufacture;Schottky barriers;ytterbium compounds;erbium compounds","metal source-drain Schottky-barrier;MOSFET technology;leakage current;parasitic bipolar action;CMOS manufacturing process;high-k gate insulators;strained silicon substrates;interfacial layers;SB-PMOS devices;ytterbium silicide;erbium silicide;intrinsic Schottky potential barrier;10 nm;30 nm;YbSi;ErSi","","359","","62","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is demonstrated theoretically and by means of an experimental system that the high PAR in OFDM can be exploited constructively in visible light communication to intensity modulate LEDs.

The main requirements for trackers are high accuracy and little latency at a reasonable cost. In order to address these issues, a real-time, robust, and efficient 3D model-based tracking algorithm is proposed for a ""video see through"" monocular vision system. The tracking of objects in the scene amounts to calculating the pose between the camera and the objects. Virtual objects can then be projected into the scene using the pose. In this paper, nonlinear pose estimation is formulated by means of a virtual visual servoing approach. In this context, the derivation of point-to-curves interaction matrices are given for different 3D geometrical primitives including straight lines, circles, cylinders, and spheres. A local moving edges tracker is used in order to provide real-time tracking of points normal to the object contours. Robustness is obtained by integrating an M-estimator into the visual control law via an iteratively reweighted least squares implementation. This approach is then extended to address the 3D model-free augmented reality problem. The method presented in this paper has been validated on several complex image sequences including outdoor environments. Results show the method to be robust to occlusion, changes in illumination, and mistracking.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2006.78","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1634325","Augmented reality;virtual visual servoing;robust estimators;real-time;model-based tracking;model-free tracking.","Augmented reality;Visual servoing;Robustness;Layout;Delay;Costs;Real time systems;Machine vision;Cameras;Robust control","computational geometry;image motion analysis;augmented reality;tracking;object detection;image sequences;least squares approximations","real-time markerless tracking;3D model-free augmented reality;virtual visual servoing framework;3D model-based tracking algorithm;monocular vision system;virtual objects;point-to-curves interaction matrices;3D geometrical primitives;M-estimator;visual control law;image sequences","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Computer Systems;Feedback;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;User-Computer Interface","265","","55","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With active disturbance rejection, perhaps we don't need to know as much as we were told. In fact, it is shown that the unknown dynamics and disturbance can be actively estimated and compensated in real time and this makes the feedback control more robust and less dependent on the detailed mathematical model of the physical process. In this paper we first examine the basic premises in the existing paradigms, from which it is argued that a paradigm shift is necessary. Using a motion control metaphor, the basis of such a shift, the active disturbance rejection control, is introduced. Stability analysis and applications are presented.

By analyzing regulator supply rejection, we show that in order to simultaneously meet the bandwidth and low dropout requirements, previous regulator implementations used in supply-regulated PLLs suffer from unfavorable tradeoffs between power supply rejection and power consumption. We therefore propose a compensation technique that places the regulator's amplifier in a local replica feedback loop, stabilizing the regulator by increasing the amplifier bandwidth while lowering its gain. Even though the forward gain of the amplifier is reduced, supply noise affects the replica output in addition to the actual output, and therefore the amplifier's gain to reject supply noise is effectively restored. Analysis shows that for reasonable mismatch between the replica and actual loads, regulator performance is uncompromised, and experimental results from a 90 nm SOI test chip confirm that with the same power consumption, the proposed regulator achieves at least 4 dB higher supply rejection than the previous regulator design. Furthermore, simulations show that if not for other supply rejection-limiting components in the PLL, the supply rejection improvement of the proposed regulator is greater than 15 dB.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2005.862347","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1583805","Phase-locked loops;power supply noise;regulators","Regulators;Phase locked loops;Bandwidth;Energy consumption;Noise reduction;Voltage-controlled oscillators;Voltage;Phase noise;Jitter;Power supplies","phase locked loops;voltage regulators;voltage-controlled oscillators;power supply circuits;circuit noise;amplifiers;compensation","replica compensated regulators;linear regulators;phase-locked loops;voltage regulator;regulator supply rejection;power supply rejection;compensation technique;local replica feedback loop;amplifier bandwidth;amplifier forward gain;regulator performance;power supply noise;SOI test chip;voltage controlled oscillator;90 nm","","94","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By sensing and adapting to its environment, such a device is able to fill voids in the wireless spectrum and can dramatically increase spectral efficiency. In this paper, the cognitive radio channel is defined as a two-sender, two-receiver interference channel in which sender 2 obtains the encoded message sender 1 plans to transmit. We consider two cases: in the genie-aided cognitive radio channel, sender 2 is noncausally presented the data to be transmitted by sender 1 while in the causal cognitive radio channel, the data is obtained causally. The cognitive radio at sender 2 may then choose to transmit simultaneously over the same channel, as opposed to waiting for an idle channel as is traditional for a cognitive radio. Our main result is the development of an achievable region which combines Gel'fand-Pinkser coding with an achievable region construction for the interference channel. In the additive Gaussian noise case, this resembles dirty-paper coding, a technique used in the computation of the capacity of the Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel. Numerical evaluation of the region in the Gaussian noise case is performed, and compared to an inner bound, the interference channel, and an outer bound, a modified Gaussian MIMO broadcast channel. Results are also extended to the case in which the message is causally obtained.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2006.872971","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1624625","Cognitive radio channel;dirty-paper coding;Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel;Gel'fand–Pinsker coding;interference channel;wireless communication","Cognitive radio;Frequency;MIMO;Interference channels;Wireless sensor networks;Radio broadcasting;Gaussian noise;Wireless communication;Software radio;FCC","wireless channels;protocols;channel coding;AWGN channels;MIMO systems;broadcast channels;software radio;radiofrequency interference","cognitive radio channels;single-protocol wireless device;two-sender two-receiver interference channel;spectral efficiency;message encoding;Gel'fand-Pinkser coding;additive Gaussian noise;dirty-paper coding;multiple-input multiple-output;Gaussian MIMO broadcast channel","","735","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing methods for computing sentence similarity have been adopted from approaches used for long text documents. These methods process sentences in a very high-dimensional space and are consequently inefficient, require human input, and are not adaptable to some application domains. This paper focuses directly on computing the similarity between very short texts of sentence length. It presents an algorithm that takes account of semantic information and word order information implied in the sentences. The semantic similarity of two sentences is calculated using information from a structured lexical database and from corpus statistics. The use of a lexical database enables our method to model human common sense knowledge and the incorporation of corpus statistics allows our method to be adaptable to different domains. The proposed method can be used in a variety of applications that involve text knowledge representation and discovery. Experiments on two sets of selected sentence pairs demonstrate that the proposed method provides a similarity measure that shows a significant correlation to human intuition","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2006.130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1644735","Sentence similarity;semantic nets;corpus;natural language processing;word similarity.","Statistics;Humans;Text mining;Web pages;Databases;Knowledge representation;Natural languages;Image retrieval;Area measurement;Natural language processing","computational linguistics;data mining;database management systems;knowledge representation;text analysis","sentence similarity computing;semantic nets;corpus statistics;text mining;Web page retrieval;dialogue system;structured lexical database;text knowledge representation;text knowledge discovery","","350","","39","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Different from traditional methods that can classify vehicles to only cars and noncars, the proposed method has a good ability to categorize vehicles into more specific classes by introducing a new ""linearity"" feature in vehicle representation. In addition, the proposed system can well tackle the problem of vehicle occlusions caused by shadows, which often lead to the failure of further vehicle counting and classification. This problem is solved by a novel line-based shadow algorithm that uses a set of lines to eliminate all unwanted shadows. The used lines are devised from the information of lane-dividing lines. Therefore, an automatic scheme to detect lane-dividing lines is also proposed. The found lane-dividing lines can also provide important information for feature normalization, which can make the vehicle size more invariant, and thus much enhance the accuracy of vehicle classification. Once all features are extracted, an optimal classifier is then designed to robustly categorize vehicles into different classes. When recognizing a vehicle, the designed classifier can collect different evidences from its trajectories and the database to make an optimal decision for vehicle classification. Since more evidences are used, more robustness of classification can be achieved. Experimental results show that the proposed method is more robust, accurate, and powerful than other traditional methods, which utilize only the vehicle size and a single frame for vehicle classification.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2006.874722","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1637673","Linearity feature;occlusions;shadow elimination;traffic surveillance;vehicle classification","Surveillance;Vehicles;Robustness;Parameter estimation;Video sequences;Cameras;Linearity;Feature extraction;Data mining;Spatial databases","surveillance;traffic information systems;image sequences;image classification;road vehicles;road traffic;feature extraction","automatic traffic surveillance system;vehicle tracking;vehicle classification;video sequences;vehicle occlusions;line-based shadow algorithm;lane-dividing lines","","258","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition to these specifications, exoskeleton haptic interface design involves consideration of space and weight limitations, workspace requirements, and the kinematic constraints placed on the device by the human arm. These constraints impose conflicting design requirements on the engineer attempting to design an arm exoskeleton. In this paper, the authors present a detailed review of the requirements and constraints that are involved in the design of a high-quality haptic arm exoskeleton. In this context, the design of a five-degree-of-freedom haptic arm exoskeleton for training and rehabilitation in virtual environments is presented. The device is capable of providing kinesthetic feedback to the joints of the lower arm and wrist of the operator, and will be used in future work for robot-assisted rehabilitation and training. Motivation for such applications is based on findings that show robot-assisted physical therapy aids in the rehabilitation process following neurological injuries. As a training tool, the device provides a means to implement flexible, repeatable, and safe training methodologies.","1941-014X","","10.1109/TMECH.2006.875558","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1642690","Arm exoskeleton;design methodology;force feedback;haptic interface;robot aided rehabilitation","Haptic interfaces;Exoskeletons;Rehabilitation robotics;Damping;Kinematics;Humans;Design engineering;Virtual environment;Neurofeedback;Wrist","haptic interfaces;medical robotics;damping;manipulator kinematics;feedback;patient rehabilitation;control engineering computing","haptic arm exoskeleton;robot assisted training;haptic interface;inertia;damping;structural stiffness;kinematic constraints;virtual environments;kinesthetic feedback;robot-assisted rehabilitation","","194","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is true for the field of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (EAs) as it is for any other field. Many of the multiobjective test problems employed in the EA literature have not been rigorously analyzed, which makes it difficult to draw accurate conclusions about the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithms tested on them. In this paper, we systematically review and analyze many problems from the EA literature, each belonging to the important class of real-valued, unconstrained, multiobjective test problems. To support this, we first introduce a set of test problem criteria, which are in turn supported by a set of definitions. Our analysis of test problems highlights a number of areas requiring attention. Not only are many test problems poorly constructed but also the important class of nonseparable problems, particularly nonseparable multimodal problems, is poorly represented. Motivated by these findings, we present a flexible toolkit for constructing well-designed test problems.

In this study, a micromechanical force sensing system was used to characterize and quantitate mechanical modifications of the zebrafish embryo chorion during early development. Quantitative relationships between applied forces and chorion structural deformations were established at various embryonic stages. The measured penetration force into the chorion at the blastula stage was 1.3-fold greater than those at the prehatching stage. Furthermore, chorion elastic modulus values were determined by using a biomembrane elastic model. The elastic modulus of the chorion at the blastula stage was 1.66-fold greater than that at the prehatching stage, thus indicating that the chorion envelope become mechanically ""softened"" at the prehatching stage. The experimental results quantitatively describe ""chorion softening,"" which is most likely due to proteolytic activities at the prehatching stage. Gradual chorion softening during embryonic development was also artificially achieved by treating blastula chorion with pronase, a proteolytic enzyme. The forces required to penetrate the pronase-treated chorion were similar to those at the prehatching stage. This similarity suggests that ""chorion softening"" may be induced by the release of protease from the embryos, and the chemical nature of the process involves proteolytic fragmentation of the ZP2 protein.","1558-2639","","10.1109/TNB.2006.875054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1637449","Cellular force sensing;chorion softening;elastic modulus;hatching;peptide fragmentation;protease;proteolytic activities;zebrafish embryo","Softening;Embryo;Biochemistry;Force measurement;Biomembranes;Sun;Chemical processes;Organisms;Electrochemical machining;Glands","biomembranes;enzymes;molecular biophysics;force sensors;biological techniques;micromechanical devices;biomechanics;deformation;elastic moduli;biochemistry","mechanical analysis;chorion softening;prehatching stages;Zebrafish embryos;micromechanical force sensing system;structural deformations;penetration force;elastic modulus;biomembrane elastic model;embryonic development;pronase;proteolytic enzyme;proteolytic fragmentation;ZP2 protein","Animals;Biomechanics;Biomechanics;Chorion;Chorion;Computer Simulation;Egg Proteins;Elasticity;Embryo, Nonmammalian;Hardness Tests;Hardness Tests;Membrane Glycoproteins;Models, Biological;Morphogenesis;Physical Stimulation;Physical Stimulation;Receptors, Cell Surface;Stress, Mechanical;Zebrafish;Zebrafish","55","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Corneal reflections are produced by light sources that illuminate the eye and the centers of the pupil and corneal reflections are estimated in video images from one or more cameras. The general theory covers the full range of possible system configurations. Using one camera and one light source, the POG can be estimated only if the head is completely stationary. Using one camera and multiple light sources, the POG can be estimated with free head movements, following the completion of a multiple-point calibration procedure. When multiple cameras and multiple light sources are used, the POG can be estimated following a simple one-point calibration procedure. Experimental and simulation results suggest that the main sources of gaze estimation errors are the discrepancy between the shape of real corneas and the spherical corneal shape assumed in the general theory, and the noise in the estimation of the centers of the pupil and corneal reflections.

In a downlink MIMO system with a large number of users, the base station may select a subset of users to serve in order to maximize the total throughput. The brute-force search for the optimal user set, however, is computationally prohibitive. We propose two low-complexity suboptimal user selection algorithms for multiuser MIMO systems with BD. Both algorithms aim to select a subset of users such that the total throughput is nearly maximized. The first user selection algorithm greedily maximizes the total throughput, whereas the criterion of the second algorithm is based on the channel energy.

The challenge of designing such a converter for high power applications is how to handle the high current at the input and high voltage at the output. An effective way is to parallel the inputs and series the outputs of the isolated boost converters. Based on this concept, a new interleaved and isolated boost converter is proposed in this paper that has two inductors in parallel at the input to share the current and two capacitors in series at the output to share the voltage. The current stresses and voltage stresses of the converter are both alleviated. The two boost converter cells realize demagnetizing by helping each other, which simplifies the transformer structures. With interleaved operation, the current ripple is smaller; therefore, it is possible to use smaller capacitors at the input and output of the converter. All these features make the new interleaved isolated boost converter desirable for high power low-to-high dc/dc applications. The proposed interleaved isolated boost converter is presented based on the basic isolated boost converter, but the interleaved structure is applicable to other isolated boost converters including the full-bridge converter, the push-pull converter, and the L-type half-bridge converter. The theoretical analysis is verified by a 200W prototype.","1048-2334","0-7803-9547-6","10.1109/APEC.2006.1620519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1620519","","Stress;Circuits;Capacitors;Switches;Switching converters;Voltage;Inductors;Demagnetization;Power electronics;Laboratories","power convertors;power integrated circuits;inductors","interleaved boost converter;isolated boost converter;high power applications;low-to-high dc/dc application;power converter;current stresses;voltage stresses;transformer structures simplification;full-bridge converter;push-pull converter;L-type converter;half-bridge converter;200 W","","31","","2","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, the impact on losses of different DG technologies, such as combined heat and power, wind power, photovoltaic, and fuel-cells, is analyzed. Results show that energy losses variation, as a function of the DG penetration level, presents a characteristic U-shape trajectory. Moreover, when DG units are more dispersed along network feeders, higher losses reduction can be expected. Regarding DG technologies, it should be noted that wind power is the one that shows the worst behavior in losses reduction.

We propose a practical and robust approach of video stabilization that produces full-frame stabilized videos with good visual quality. While most previous methods end up with producing smaller size stabilized videos, our completion method can produce full-frame videos by naturally filling in missing image parts by locally aligning image data of neighboring frames. To achieve this, motion inpainting is proposed to enforce spatial and temporal consistency of the completion in both static and dynamic image areas. In addition, image quality in the stabilized video is enhanced with a new practical deblurring algorithm. Instead of estimating point spread functions, our method transfers and interpolates sharper image pixels of neighboring frames to increase the sharpness of the frame. The proposed video completion and deblurring methods enabled us to develop a complete video stabilizer which can naturally keep the original image quality in the stabilized videos.

Despite some scattered results, a principled approach towards ""when and where to take a step"" has not yet emerged. Towards this goal, we present methods for computing capture points and the capture region, the region on the ground where a humanoid must step to in order to come to a complete stop. The intersection between the capture region and the base of support determines which strategy the robot should adopt to successfully stop in a given situation. Computing the capture region for a humanoid, in general, is very difficult. However, with simple models of walking, computation of the capture region is simplified. We extend the well-known linear inverted pendulum model to include a flywheel body and show how to compute exact solutions of the capture region for this model. Adding rotational inertia enables the humanoid to control its centroidal angular momentum, much like the way human beings do, significantly enlarging the capture region. We present simulations of a simple planar biped that can recover balance after a push by stepping to the capture region and using internal angular momentum. Ongoing work involves applying the solution from the simple model as an approximate solution to more complex simulations of bipedal walking, including a 3D biped with distributed mass.","2164-0580","1-4244-0199-2","10.1109/ICHR.2006.321385","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4115602","","Biological system modeling;Legged locomotion;Humans;Humanoid robots;Flywheels;Computational modeling;Closed-form solution;Acceleration;Foot;Cognition","humanoid robots;legged locomotion;nonlinear control systems;position control;torque control","capture point;humanoid push recovery;humanoid robot;capture region;linear inverted pendulum model;flywheel body;rotational inertia;centroidal angular momentum;biped robot","","489","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The quest to achieve a good-drivability, noise-robustness, and low-energy operations for deep submicrometer guided our research to explore hybrid-CMOS style design. Hybrid-CMOS design style utilizes various CMOS logic style circuits to build new full adders with desired performance. This provides the designer a higher degree of design freedom to target a wide range of applications, thus significantly reducing design efforts. We also classify hybrid-CMOS full adders into three broad categories based upon their structure. Using this categorization, many full-adder designs can be conceived. We will present a new full-adder design belonging to one of the proposed categories. The new full adder is based on a novel xor-xnor circuit that generates xor and xnor full-swing outputs simultaneously. This circuit outperforms its counterparts showing 5%-37% improvement in the power-delay product (PDP). A novel hybrid-CMOS output stage that exploits the simultaneous xor-xnor signals is also proposed. This output stage provides good driving capability enabling cascading of adders without the need of buffer insertion between cascaded stages. There is approximately a 40% reduction in PDP when compared to its best counterpart. During our experimentations, we found out that many of the previously reported adders suffered from the problems of low swing and high noise when operated at low supply voltages.

The proposed new design was simulated by the full-wave electromagnetic software IE3D and validated by the measurement. Compared with the cascading microstrip multisection coupled-line configuration, our newly proposed planar one with a patterned ground plane is small in size and, meanwhile, has a good performance. As an example, one Schiffman phase shifter on a double-sided printed circuit board is designed, simulated, fabricated, and measured. The measured amplitude and phase imbalance between the two paths are within 0.5 dB and 5/spl deg/, respectively, over the frequency band from 1.5 to 3.1 GHz, or around 70% bandwidth.

The topology of such networks changes continuously as new nodes join and old nodes leave the network. Algorithms for such networks need to be robust against changes in topology. Additionally, nodes in sensor networks operate under limited computational, communication, and energy resources. These constraints have motivated the design of ""gossip"" algorithms: schemes which distribute the computational burden and in which a node communicates with a randomly chosen neighbor. We analyze the averaging problem under the gossip constraint for an arbitrary network graph, and find that the averaging time of a gossip algorithm depends on the second largest eigenvalue of a doubly stochastic matrix characterizing the algorithm. Designing the fastest gossip algorithm corresponds to minimizing this eigenvalue, which is a semidefinite program (SDP). In general, SDPs cannot be solved in a distributed fashion; however, exploiting problem structure, we propose a distributed subgradient method that solves the optimization problem over the network. The relation of averaging time to the second largest eigenvalue naturally relates it to the mixing time of a random walk with transition probabilities derived from the gossip algorithm. We use this connection to study the performance and scaling of gossip algorithms on two popular networks: Wireless Sensor Networks, which are modeled as Geometric Random Graphs, and the Internet graph under the so-called Preferential Connectivity (PC) model.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2006.874516","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1638541","Distributed averaging;gossip;random walk;scaling laws;sensor networks;semidefinite programming","Peer to peer computing;Algorithm design and analysis;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Computer networks;Distributed computing;Network topology;Solid modeling;Ad hoc networks;Distributed algorithms;Robustness","wireless sensor networks;graph theory;Internet;matrix algebra;distributed algorithms;stochastic processes;minimisation;randomised algorithms","randomized gossip algorithm;network computing;information exchange;network topology;doubly stochastic matrix;minimization;semidefinite program;SDP;distributed subgradient method;random walk;transition probability;wireless sensor network;geometric random graph;Internet graph;preferential connectivity model","","1239","","48","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The objective of this paper is to study the transient responses of various well-known antennas over broad frequency ranges. As such, the phase responses of these antennas as a function of frequency are of great interest. In the ensuing analysis, each antenna is excited by a monocycle pulse. Many antennas show resonant properties, and numerous reflections exist in the antennas' outputs. The first part of this paper deals with ways of converting various resonating antennas to traveling-wave antennas by using resistive loading. Appropriate loading increases the bandwidth of operation of the antennas. However, the drawback is the additional loss in the load applied to the antenna structure, leading to a loss of efficiency to around fifty percent. However, some of the antennas are inherently broadband, up to a 100:1 bandwidth. Hence, the transient responses of these antennas can be used to determine their suitability for wideband applications with a low cutoff frequency. The second part of the paper illustrates the radiation and reception properties of various conventional ultra-wideband (UWB) antennas in the time domain.

In this paper, a unified analysis of the relationships between time-domain jitter and various spectral characterizations of phase noise is first presented. Several notions of phase noise spectra are considered, in particular, the power-spectral density (PSD) of the excess phase noise, the PSD of the signal generated by a noisy oscillator/PLL, and the so-called single-sideband (SSB) phase noise spectrum. We investigate the origins of these phase noise spectra and discuss their mathematical soundness. A simple equation relating the variance of timing jitter to the phase noise spectrum is derived and its mathematical validity is analyzed. Then, practical results on computing jitter from spectral phase noise characteristics for oscillators and PLLs with both white (thermal, shot) and 1/f noise are presented.

Many prophetic visions have appeared in the literature presenting 4G as the ultimate boundary of wireless mobile communication without any limit to its potential, but in practical terms not giving any design rules and thus any definition of it. In this article we give a pragmatic definition of 4G derived from a new user-centric methodology that considers the user as the ""cornerstone"" of the design. In this way, we devise fundamental user scenarios that implicitly reveal the key features of 4G, which are then expressed explicitly in a new framework - the ""user-centric"" system - that describes the various level of interdependency among them. This approach consequently contributes to the identification of the real technical step-up of 4G with respect to 3G. Finally, an example of a potential 4G application is also given in order to demonstrate the validity of the overall methodology","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.2006.1580917","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1580917","","Isolation technology;Wireless communication;4G mobile communication;Communication industry;Communications technology;Investments;Wireless application protocol;Consumer electronics;Industrial electronics;Electronics industry","4G mobile communication;broadband networks","4G technology;wireless mobile communication systems;mobile broadband technologies;user-centric methodology","","101","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Vt  shifts that occur under negative gate bias is referred as NBTI and those that occur under positive bias is referred as PBTI or charge trapping. In this paper, we present a comparative study of NBTI and PBTI for a variety of FETs with different dielectric stacks and gate materials. The study has two parts. In part I, NBTI and PBTI measurements are performed for FUSI NiSi gated FETs with SiO2 SiO2/HfO2 and SiO2/HfSiO as gate dielectric stacks and the results are compared with those for conventional SiON/poly-Si FETs. The main results are: (i) NBTI for SiO 2/NiSi and SiO2/HfO2/NiSi are same as those conventional SiON/poly-Si FETs; (ii) PBTI significantly increases as the Hf content in the high K layer is increased; and (iii) PBTI is a greater reliability issue than NBTI for HfO2/NiSi FETs. In part II of the study, NBTI and PBTI measurements are performed for SiO2/HfO2 devices with TiN and Re as gates and the results are compared with those for NiSi gated FETs. The main results are: (i) NBTI for SiO 2/HfO2/TiN and SiO2/HfO2/Re pFETs are similar with those observed for NiSi gated pFETs; and (ii) PBTI in TiN and Re gated HfO2 devices is much smaller than those observed for SiO2/HfO2/NiSi. In summary for SiO2/HfO2 stacks, NBTI is observed to be independent of gate material whereas PBTI is significantly worse for FUSI gated devices.

When interfaced to the utility grid, microgrids are exposed to common utility power-quality disturbances. In particular, during utility-voltage sags, large line currents can flow along distribution feeders connecting the micro- and utility grids. To limit this flow of large line currents and, hence, protect the microgrids, this paper proposes two current-limiting algorithms, namely, the RL feedforward and flux-charge-model feedback algorithms, for controlling a series inverter connected between the micro- and utility grids during utility voltage sags. Both methods function by inserting a large virtual RL or L impedance in series with the distribution feeder to limit the line-current flow. Detailed descriptions, controller designs, and comparisons of both algorithms are presented. Phasor analyses of both methods are also presented to show how the inserted RL or L values can be optimally tuned to improve the inverter damping performance and minimize its injected voltages and circulating power under all operation conditions.

Finally, traffic flow forecasting is performed under the criterion of minimum mean square error (mmse). The approach departs from many existing traffic flow forecasting models in that it explicitly includes information from adjacent road links to analyze the trends of the current link statistically.

As nodes of BASN are expected to be interconnected on or in the human body, the body itself can form an inherently secure communication pathway that is unavailable to all other kinds of wireless networks. This article explores the use of this conduit in the security mechanism of BASN; that is, by a biometrics approach that uses an intrinsic characteristic of the human body as the authentication identity or the means of securing the distribution of a cipher key to secure inter-BASN communications. The method was tested on 99 subjects with 838 segments of simultaneous recordings of electrocardiogram and photoplethysmogram. By using the interpulse interval (IPI) as the biometric trait, the system achieved a minimum half total error rate of 2.58 percent when the IPIs measured from signals, which were sampled at 1000 Hz, were coded into 128-bit binary sequences. The study opens up a few key issues for future investigation, including compensation schemes for the asynchrony of different channels, coding schemes, and other suitable biometric traits.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2006.1632652","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1632652","","Wireless sensor networks;Biometrics;Communication system security;Biosensors;Telemedicine;Humans;Wireless networks;Authentication;Testing;Error analysis","wireless sensor networks;telemedicine;telecommunication security;cryptography;biosensors;mobile radio","biometrics method;secure wireless body area sensor networks;telemedicine;m-health;authentication identity;cipher key;interpulse interval;electrocardiogram;photoplethysmogram","","339","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In this paper, we introduce the wormhole attack, a severe attack in ad hoc networks that is particularly challenging to defend against. The wormhole attack is possible even if the attacker has not compromised any hosts, and even if all communication provides authenticity and confidentiality. In the wormhole attack, an attacker records packets (or bits) at one location in the network, tunnels them (possibly selectively) to another location, and retransmits them there into the network. The wormhole attack can form a serious threat in wireless networks, especially against many ad hoc network routing protocols and location-based wireless security systems. For example, most existing ad hoc network routing protocols, without some mechanism to defend against the wormhole attack, would be unable to find routes longer than one or two hops, severely disrupting communication. We present a general mechanism, called packet leashes, for detecting and, thus defending against wormhole attacks, and we present a specific protocol, called TIK, that implements leashes. We also discuss topology-based wormhole detection, and show that it is impossible for these approaches to detect some wormhole topologies.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2005.861394","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1589115","Ad hoc networks;computer network security;computer networks;packet leash;TIK;tunneling;wireless local area network (LAN);wormhole","Intelligent networks;Wireless networks;Ad hoc networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Computer networks;NASA;Communication system security;Network topology;Computer security","mobile radio;ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless LAN;telecommunication network topology","wormhole attack;mobile ad hoc network;TIK routing protocol;location-based wireless security system;packet leash;topology-based wormhole detection;wireless local area network;LAN","","265","","42","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This requires that methods to improve power qualify and stability for such systems be found. The static compensator (STATCOM) with hybrid battery energy storage (BES) has great potential to fulfil this role, though considerable advances in the control of this system are still to be made. From an economic point of view, rating the STATCOM for steady-state power-quality improvement duty is appropriate. Rating the STATCOM to absorb large amounts of additional power in excess of its transient overload capability during network faults is inappropriate. A hybrid of BES and braking resistor is therefore proposed. A new hybrid STATCOM-BES control technique is developed and discussed in the context of improving the stability and power quality to fixed speed, induction generator, wind turbines. The variation of the network voltage, active and reactive power with the fluctuation of the wind generation is studied.

However, the power system security and stability may be affected due to the higher wind power penetration. Because majority of the wind farms with higher installed capacity intends to be connected into the transmission network of 220 kV voltage level, their impacts are becoming more widespread. In the grid impact studies of wind power integration, voltage stability is the mostly concerned problem that will affect the operation and security of wind farms and power grid. In this paper, the detailed wind turbines steady-state model and dynamic model are used to explore the wind power integration impact on voltage stability of the power system; the load flow calculation (P-V curve and V-Q curve) and dynamic contingency study are conducted; the different impacts on voltage stability of integrating wind farms based on different wind turbines technologies are illustrated and the following conclusions are presented: a. Wind turbines equipped with simple induction generator are not provided with reactive power regulation capability. Voltage stability deterioration is mainly due to the large amount of reactive power absorbed by the wind turbine generators during the continuous operation and system contingencies. b. Wind turbines equipped with doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) controlled by the PWM converters are provided with reactive power regulation capability; can absorb or supply reactive power during normal operation. The adverse affect on local network voltage stability is mitigated so that more wind power installed capacity can be incorporated into the grid. c. The transient voltage stability characteristics of wind turbines with DFIG are better than wind turbines with induction generator because of the voltage control capability of the DFIG based wind turbines; The DFIG based wind turbines have a better voltage recovery performance than the IG based wind turbines with same rating.","","1-4244-0110-0","10.1109/ICPST.2006.321661","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4115920","Wind power integration;Wind turbines;Induction generator (IG);Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG);Dynamic model;Load flow;Voltage stability","Voltage;Stability analysis;Wind farms;Wind turbines;Wind energy;Power system stability;Induction generators;Power system security;Power system modeling;Power system dynamics","asynchronous generators;load flow;power system security;power system transient stability;PWM power convertors;transmission networks;wind power plants;wind turbines","voltage stability analysis;wind farm integration;transmission network;power system security;power system stability;steady-state model;load flow calculation;dynamic contingency;wind turbine generators;doubly fed induction generator;PWM converters;reactive power regulation capability;local network voltage stability;transient voltage stability","","53","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such trends are accelerated by the introduction of novel materials and nontraditional transistor geometries, including ultrathin body, FinFET, or nanowire devices, which impede heat conduction. Thermal analysis is complicated by subcontinuum phenomena including ballistic electron transport, which reshapes the heat generation region compared with classical diffusion theory predictions.

It is found theoretically and experimentally that the maximum output power and the optimal current, which give this maximum, have a linear relation at a constant temperature. Furthermore, it is also shown that linearity exists between the short-circuit current and the optimal current. MPPT control rules are created based on the findings from solar arrays that can respond at high speeds to variations in irradiation. The proposed MPPT control method sets the output current track on the line that gives the relation between the MP and the optimal current so as to acquire the MP that can be generated at that time by dividing the power and current characteristics into two fields. The method is based on the generated power being a binary function of the output current. Considering the experimental fact that linearity is maintained only at low irradiation below half the maximum irradiation, the proportionality coefficient (voltage coefficient) is compensated for only in regions with more than half the rated optimal current, which correspond to the maximum irradiation. At high irradiation, the voltage coefficient needed to perform the proposed MPPT control is acquired through the hill-climbing method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through experiments under various weather conditions","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2006.878328","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1667903","Current control;irradiation;maximum power point tracking (MPPT);photovoltaic (PV);PV power generation","Control systems;Power generation;Solar power generation;Optimal control;Photovoltaic systems;Linearity;Voltage;Solar radiation;Temperature;Character generation","photovoltaic power systems;power generation control;solar cell arrays;solar radiation","MPPT control;weather conditions;PV generation systems;maximum power point tracking control;solar radiation;maximum irradiation;voltage coefficient;hill-climbing method","","244","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Suppose that one forms a short linear combination of elementary signals drawn from a large, fixed collection. Given an observation of the linear combination that has been contaminated with additive noise, the goal is to identify which elementary signals participated and to approximate their coefficients. Although many algorithms have been proposed, there is little theory which guarantees that these algorithms can accurately and efficiently solve the problem. This paper studies a method called convex relaxation, which attempts to recover the ideal sparse signal by solving a convex program. This approach is powerful because the optimization can be completed in polynomial time with standard scientific software. The paper provides general conditions which ensure that convex relaxation succeeds. As evidence of the broad impact of these results, the paper describes how convex relaxation can be used for several concrete signal recovery problems.

This shifts much of the computational burden to a training phase, without sacrificing recognition performance. As a result, the resulting algorithm is robust, accurate, and fast-enough for frame-rate performance. This reduction in runtime computational complexity is our first contribution. Our second contribution is to show that, in this context, a simple and fast keypoint detector suffices to support detection and tracking even under large perspective and scale variations. While earlier methods require a detector that can be expected to produce very repeatable results, in general, which usually is very time-consuming, we simply find the most repeatable object keypoints for the specific target object during the training phase.

Using this basic model, conditions for minimum sensor network power consumption are derived for communication of sensor data from a source device to a destination node. Power consumption model parameters are extracted for two types of wireless sensor nodes that are widely used and commercially available. For typical hardware configurations and RF environments, it is shown that whenever single hop routing is possible it is almost always more power efficient than multi-hop routing. Further consideration of communication protocol overhead also shows that single hop routing will be more power efficient compared to multi-hop routing under realistic circumstances.

Subsequently, the algorithm is applied to an MPPT system based on the ""perturb and observe"" method. The steady-state behavior of the PV system with MPPT control is characterized by a stable oscillation around the maximum power point.

One can show that monopulse estimation is based on a general approximation derived from maximum likelihood (ML) estimation. This tutorial provides a derivation of this relation and presents extensions of this monopulse principle to multi-dimensional array and parameter estimation problems, in particular to space-time adaptive processing (STAP) with reduced dimension, subarrays and generalized sidelobe canceller (GSLC) configurations. The performance of these monopulse applications can be predicted by exploiting the distribution of the monopulse ratio. It is demonstrated that this distribution is more realistic than the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). Several examples of performance of monopulse estimators are given for thinned and fully filled planar arrays, adaptive beamforming with and without low sidelobes, GSLC, and STAP.

In this paper, we address the problem of vulnerable Web applications by means of static source code analysis. More precisely, we use flow-sensitive, interprocedural and context-sensitive dataflow analysis to discover vulnerable points in a program. In addition, alias and literal analysis are employed to improve the correctness and precision of the results. The presented concepts are targeted at the general class of taint-style vulnerabilities and can be applied to the detection of vulnerability types such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, or command injection. Pixy, the open source prototype implementation of our concepts, is targeted at detecting cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in PHP scripts. Using our tool, we discovered and reported 15 previously unknown vulnerabilities in three Web applications, and reconstructed 36 known vulnerabilities in three other Web applications.

It was found that the work function of the TiN (phiTiN) slightly decreases with increasing nitrogen (N2) gas flow ratio, RN=N2/(Ar+N2) in the sputtering, from 17% to 100%. The experimental threshold voltage (Vth) dependence on the RN shows that the more RN offers the lower Vth for the TiN gate n-channel FinFETs. The composition analysis of the TiN films with different RN showed that the more amount of nitrogen is introduced into the TiN films with increasing RN, which suggests that the lowering of phi TiN with increasing RN should be related to the increase in nitrogen concentration in the TiN film. The desirable Vth shift from -0.22 to 0.22 V was experimentally confirmed by fabricating n+ poly-Si and TiN gate n-channel multi-FinFETs without a channel doping.

The charge pump exploits an automatic pumping control scheme to provide small ripple output voltage and fast start-up by decoupling output ripple and start-up time. The automatic pumping control scheme is composed of two schemes, an automatic pumping current control scheme and an automatic pumping frequency control scheme. The former automatically adjusts the size of pumping driver to reduce ripple voltage according to output voltage. The latter changes the pumping period by controlling a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). The output frequency of the VCO varies from 400 kHz to 600 kHz by controlling the input bias voltage of the VCO. The prototype chip delivers regulated 4.5-V output voltage from a supply voltage of 3.3 V with a flying capacitor of 330 nF, while providing 30 mA of load current. The area is 0.25 mm/sup 2/ and the measured output ripple voltage is less than 33.8 mV with a 2-/spl mu/F load capacitor. The power efficiency is greater than 70% at the range of load current from 1 to 30 mA. An analytical model for ripple voltage and recovery time is proposed demonstrating a reasonable agreement with SPICE simulation results.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2005.862340","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1583806","Automatic pumping control;large load current;regulated charge pump;small ripple voltage","Charge pumps;Voltage-controlled oscillators;CMOS technology;Voltage control;Capacitors;Analytical models;Circuits;Automatic voltage control;Current control;Frequency control","voltage regulators;CMOS integrated circuits;voltage-controlled oscillators;SPICE","regulated charge pump circuit;CMOS technology;automatic pumping control;automatic pumping current control;automatic pumping frequency control;pumping driver;voltage-controlled oscillator;flying capacitor;output ripple voltage;SPICE simulation;2 muF;330 nF;1 to 30 mA;30 mA;400 to 600 kHz;0.13 micron;3.3 V;4.5 V","","61","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper adopts the multiagent system approach to develop distributed unsupervised traffic responsive signal control models, where each agent in the system is a local traffic signal controller for one intersection in the traffic network. The first multiagent system is developed using hybrid computational intelligent techniques. Each agent employs a multistage online learning process to update and adapt its knowledge base and decision-making mechanism. The second multiagent system is developed by integrating the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation theorem in fuzzy neural networks (NN). The problem of real-time traffic signal control is especially challenging if the agents are used for an infinite horizon problem, where online learning has to take place continuously once the agent-based traffic signal controllers are implemented into the traffic network. A comprehensive simulation model of a section of the Central Business District of Singapore has been developed using PARAMICS microscopic simulation program. Simulation results show that the hybrid multiagent system provides significant improvement in traffic conditions when evaluated against an existing traffic signal control algorithm as well as the SPSA-NN-based multiagent system as the complexity of the simulation scenario increases. Using the hybrid NN-based multiagent system, the mean delay of each vehicle was reduced by 78% and the mean stoppage time, by 85% compared to the existing traffic signal control algorithm. The promising results demonstrate the efficacy of the hybrid NN-based multiagent system in solving large-scale traffic signal control problems in a distributed manner","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2006.874716","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1688100","Distributed control;hybrid model;neural control;online learning;traffic signal control","Neural networks;Communication system traffic control;Traffic control;Multiagent systems;Control systems;Real time systems;Distributed control;Computational intelligence;Competitive intelligence;Decision making","distributed control;fuzzy neural nets;multi-agent systems;neurocontrollers;road traffic;traffic engineering computing","fuzzy neural networks;real-time traffic signal control;urban traffic control system;distributed control;multi-agent system;hybrid computational intelligent techniques;multistage online learning process;knowledge-base mechanism;decision making mechanism;simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation theorem","","193","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although many approaches for data extraction from Web pages have been developed, there has been limited effort to compare such tools. Unfortunately, in only a few cases can the results generated by distinct tools be directly compared since the addressed extraction tasks are different. This paper surveys the major Web data extraction approaches and compares them in three dimensions: the task domain, the automation degree, and the techniques used. The criteria of the first dimension explain why an IE system fails to handle some Web sites of particular structures.

Most of the existing automated systems for facial expression analysis attempt to recognize a few prototypic emotional expressions, such as anger and happiness. Instead of representing another approach to machine analysis of prototypic facial expressions of emotion, the method presented in this paper attempts to handle a large range of human facial behavior by recognizing facial muscle actions that produce expressions. Virtually all of the existing vision systems for facial muscle action detection deal only with frontal-view face images and cannot handle temporal dynamics of facial actions. In this paper, we present a system for automatic recognition of facial action units (AUs) and their temporal models from long, profile-view face image sequences. We exploit particle filtering to track 15 facial points in an input face-profile sequence, and we introduce facial-action-dynamics recognition from continuous video input using temporal rules. The algorithm performs both automatic segmentation of an input video into facial expressions pictured and recognition of temporal segments (i.e., onset, apex, offset) of 27 AUs occurring alone or in a combination in the input face-profile video. A recognition rate of 87% is achieved.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2005.859075","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1605389","Computer vision;facial action units;facial expression analysis;facial expression dynamics analysis;particle filtering;rule-based reasoning;spatial reasoning;temporal reasoning","Face recognition;Image recognition;Image segmentation;Image sequences;Face detection;Humans;Emotion recognition;Prototypes;Facial muscles;Machine vision","face recognition;emotion recognition;image segmentation;image sequences;computer vision;particle filtering (numerical methods)","automatic human facial expression analysis;facial muscle action recognition;temporal segment recognition;face profile image sequences;emotional expression recognition;human facial behavior;computer vision system;automatic facial action unit recognition;temporal model;particle filtering;facial-action-dynamics recognition;automatic video segmentation","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Face;Face;Facial Expression;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Movement;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photography;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique;Time Factors;Video Recording","309","","57","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, in the current bulk power system reliability assessment practice, protection systems are generally assumed to be perfect, and the effects of hidden failures in protection systems are not taken into account. In this paper, the impact of protection system hidden failures on bulk power system reliability is investigated. A breaker-oriented bulk power system network model is developed to include detailed system substation configurations and associated protection system schemes. Protection system constituents, such as transducers, relays, circuit breakers, may suffer from hidden failures. Hidden failures existing in transducers and relays can be detected by the advanced system real time monitoring and analysis technologies. Thus, the major concern of this work focuses on the analysis of hidden failures in circuit breakers. The hidden failure effects analysis shows that some initial system disturbances can result in the unnecessary outages of intact power system equipment because of hidden failures in circuit breaker trip mechanisms. Contingencies resulting from hidden failure outages are further evaluated by a security-constrained adequacy evaluation methodology to obtain their influence on system reliability. The proposed analysis procedure is demonstrated with a breaker- oriented 24-substation reliability test system, which is developed based on the IEEE 24-bus reliability test system and integrates explicit substation and protection system models in the network model. Evaluation results show that protection system hidden failures downgrade the system reliability level because they lead to the outages of undamaged equipment following initial system disturbances.","","1-4244-0227-1","10.1109/NAPS.2006.359621","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4201364","Hidden failure;protection system;circuit breaker-oriented substation model;bulk power system reliability assessment;advanced real time power system monitoring and analysis;security-constrained adequacy evaluation","Power system protection;Power system reliability;Substation protection;Power system relaying;Circuit breakers;Failure analysis;Power system analysis computing;Power system modeling;Transducers;Protective relaying","circuit breakers;condition monitoring;power system faults;power system measurement;power system protection;power system reliability;power system security;substation protection","protection system hidden failures;bulk power system reliability;breaker-oriented bulk power system network model;substation configurations;transducers;relays;advanced system real time monitoring technology;circuit breaker trip mechanism;security-constrained adequacy evaluation methodology","","26","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This access scheme is designed for the multihop context, where it is important to find a compromise between the spatial density of communications and the range of each transmission. More precisely, the analysis aims at optimizing the product of the number of simultaneously successful transmissions per unit of space (spatial reuse) by the average range of each transmission. The optimization is obtained via an averaging over all Poisson configurations for the location of interfering mobiles, where an exact evaluation of signal over noise ratio is possible. The main mathematical tools stem from stochastic geometry and are spatial versions of the so-called additive and max shot noise processes. The resulting medium access control (MAC) protocol exhibits some interesting properties. First, it can be implemented in a decentralized way provided some local geographic information is available to the mobiles. In addition, its transport capacity is proportional to the square root of the density of mobiles which is the upper bound of Gupta and Kumar.

The proposed initial rotor-position-estimation method is suitable to avoid the temporary reverse rotation or the starting failure of the HDD. The principle of the estimation is based on the variation of the current response caused by the magnetic saturation of the stator core of the BLDC motor when the current flows along the magnetic axis. This method can be implemented using only one current sensor at the dc link of the inverter, which is a prerequisite for the HDD drive.

A family of multiport bidirectional DC-DC converters derived from a general topology is presented. The topology shows a combination of DC-link and magnetic coupling. This structure makes use of both methods to interconnect multiple sources without the penalty of extra conversion or additional switches. The resulting converters have the advantage of being simple in topology and have a minimum number of power devices. The proposed general topology and basic cells show several possibilities to construct a multiport converter for particular applications and provide a solution to integrate diverse sources owing to their flexibility in structure. The system features a minimal number of conversion steps, low cost and compact packaging. In addition, the control and power management of the converter by a single digital processor is possible. The centralised control eliminates complicated communication structures that would be necessary in the conventional structure based on separate conversion stages. A control strategy based on classical control theory is proposed, showing a multiple PID-loop structure. The general topology and a set of three-port embodiments are detailed.","1350-2352","","10.1049/ip-epa:20050362","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1629526","","","DC-DC power convertors;three-term control;centralised control;network topology","multiport bidirectional DC-DC converter;generation system;sustainable energy sources;DC-link;magnetic coupling;power devices;power management;digital processor;centralised control;classical control theory;PID-loop structure","","241","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals"

The novel networking paradigm poses interdisciplinary challenges that will require new technological solutions. In particular, in this article we adopt a top-down approach to explore the research challenges in mobile UWSN design. Along the layered protocol stack, we proceed roughly from the top application layer to the bottom physical layer. At each layer, a set of new design intricacies is studied.

It is shown in this paper that by appropriate sampling of the constraints one obtains a standard convex optimization problem (the scenario problem) whose solution is approximately feasible for the original (usually infinite) set of constraints, i.e., the measure of the set of original constraints that are violated by the scenario solution rapidly decreases to zero as the number of samples is increased. We provide an explicit and efficient bound on the number of samples required to attain a-priori specified levels of probabilistic guarantee of robustness. A rich family of control problems which are in general hard to solve in a deterministically robust sense is therefore amenable to polynomial-time solution, if robustness is intended in the proposed risk-adjusted sense.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2006.875041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1632303","Probabilistic robustness;randomized algorithms;robust control;robust convex optimization;uncertainty","Robust control;Uncertainty;Robustness;Linear matrix inequalities;Constraint optimization;Polynomials;Sampling methods;Measurement standards;Lyapunov method;Adaptive control","robust control;control system analysis;control system synthesis;computational complexity;linear matrix inequalities;uncertain systems","robust control analysis;robust control synthesis;NP-hard control problems;parameter-dependent linear matrix inequalities;convex optimization;polynomial-time solution;uncertainty terms","","496","","50","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By this means, we achieve the necessary flexibility to simultaneously obtain quite symmetric frequency responses, controllable bandwidths, and compact dimensions. Two prototype device bandpass filters are provided to illustrate the potentiality of the proposed approach. In the first prototype, the structure is periodic (i.e., composed of identical cells) and behaves as a left-handed transmission line with controllable bandwidth. In the second prototype device, periodicity is sacrificed with an eye toward the synthesis of a standard (Chebyshev) approximation. The measured frequency responses point out low insertion losses in the passband, as well as high-frequency selectivity with small dimensions. As compared to conventional parallel coupled line filters, reduction of device length by a factor of 2.4 is demonstrated. This is the first time that planar filters with controllable bandwidth based on CSRRs are achieved.

The ADC has a sample-and-hold circuit that is integrated in the first pipeline stage, which removes the need for a dedicated sample-and-hold amplifier (i.e., ""SHA-less""). It also has a sampling buffer that is turned off during the hold clock phases to save power. To accurately estimate and minimize the clock jitter, a new jitter simulation technique was used whose results were verified on silicon. The measured silicon results indicate the highest published IF sampling performance to date and prove the viability of the ""SHA-less"" architecture for IF/RF sampling ADCs.

"A unifying framework for detecting outliers and change points from time series","J. Takeuchi; K. Yamanishi","Internet Syst. Res. Labs., NEC Corp., Kanngawa, Japan; Internet Syst. Res. Labs., NEC Corp., Kanngawa, Japan","IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","","2006","18","4","482","492","We are concerned with the issue of detecting outliers and change points from time series. In the area of data mining, there have been increased interest in these issues since outlier detection is related to fraud detection, rare event discovery, etc., while change-point detection is related to event/trend change detection, activity monitoring, etc. Although, in most previous work, outlier detection and change point detection have not been related explicitly, this paper presents a unifying framework for dealing with both of them. In this framework, a probabilistic model of time series is incrementally learned using an online discounting learning algorithm, which can track a drifting data source adaptively by forgetting out-of-date statistics gradually. A score for any given data is calculated in terms of its deviation from the learned model, with a higher score indicating a high possibility of being an outlier. By taking an average of the scores over a window of a fixed length and sliding the window, we may obtain a new time series consisting of moving-averaged scores. Change point detection is then reduced to the issue of detecting outliers in that time series. We compare the performance of our framework with those of conventional methods to demonstrate its validity through simulation and experimental applications to incidents detection in network security.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2006.1599387","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1599387","Time series;change point;data mining;network security;AR model.","Event detection;Data mining;Statistics;Monitoring;Change detection algorithms;Data security;Intrusion detection;Histograms","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);time series;probability;security of data","outlier detection framework;change-point detection;time series;data mining;probabilistic model;online discounting learning algorithm;incidents detection;network security","","142","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The signal spectrum over a wide frequency band is decomposed into elementary building blocks of subbands that are well characterized by local irregularities in frequency. As a powerful mathematical tool for analyzing singularities and edges, the wavelet transform is employed to detect and estimate the local spectral irregular structure, which carries important information on the frequency locations and power spectral densities of the subbands. Along this line, a couple of wideband spectrum sensing techniques are developed based on the local maxima of the wavelet transform modulus and the multi-scale wavelet products.

Careful analysis shows that the high currents on the battery side cause significant design issues in order to obtain a high efficiency.

The SINR can be decomposed into two independent random variables: SINR=SINR/sup ZF/+T, where SINR/sup ZF/ corresponds to the SINR for a zero-forcing (ZF) receiver and has an exact Gamma distribution. This correspondence focuses on characterizing the statistical properties of T using the results from random matrix theory. First three asymptotic moments of T are derived for uncorrelated channels and channels with equicorrelations. For general correlated channels, some limiting upper bounds for the first three moments are also provided. For uncorrelated channels and correlated channels satisfying certain conditions, it is proved that T converges to a Normal random variable. A Gamma distribution and a generalized Gamma distribution are proposed as approximations to the finite sample distribution of T. Simulations suggest that these approximate distributions can be used to estimate accurately the probability of errors even for very small dimensions (e.g., two transmit antennas).","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2005.860466","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1564443","Asymptotic distributions;channel correlation;error probability;Gamma approximation;minimum mean square error (MMSE) receiver;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system;random matrix;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)","Signal to noise ratio;MIMO;Performance analysis;Bit error rate;Statistics;Covariance matrix;Random variables;Transmitting antennas;Signal processing;Receiving antennas","least mean squares methods;MIMO systems;wireless channels;Rayleigh channels;gamma distribution;matrix algebra;error statistics;correlation methods;interference (signal);signal sampling;radio receivers","SINR;signal-interference-plus-noise ratio;MMSE MIMO receiver;minimum mean-square error;multiple-input multiple-output;statistical distribution;wireless communication;Rayleigh flat-fading channel;zero-forcing receiver;gamma distribution;random matrix theory;approximation theory;finite sample distribution;error probability;channel correlation","","160","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We present a novel 3D model-based algorithm which performs this task automatically and efficiently. A 3D model of an object is automatically constructed offline from its multiple unordered range images (views). These views are converted into multidimensional table representations (which we refer to as tensors). Correspondences are automatically established between these views by simultaneously matching the tensors of a view with those of the remaining views using a hash table-based voting scheme. This results in a graph of relative transformations used to register the views before they are integrated into a seamless 3D model. These models and their tensor representations constitute the model library. During online recognition, a tensor from the scene is simultaneously matched with those in the library by casting votes. Similarity measures are calculated for the model tensors which receive the most votes. The model with the highest similarity is transformed to the scene and, if it aligns accurately with an object in the scene, that object is declared as recognized and is segmented. This process is repeated until the scene is completely segmented. Experiments were performed on real and synthetic data comprised of 55 models and 610 scenes and an overall recognition rate of 95 percent was achieved.

The QoS provisioning is performed in two quality domains, namely, timeliness and reliability. Multiple QoS levels are provided in the timeliness domain by guaranteeing multiple packet delivery speed options. In the reliability domain, various reliability requirements are supported by probabilistic multipath forwarding. These mechanisms for QoS provisioning are realized in a localized way without global network information by employing localized geographic packet forwarding augmented with dynamic compensation, which compensates for local decision inaccuracies as a packet travels towards its destination. This way, MMSPEED can guarantee end-to-end requirements in a localized way, which is desirable for scalability and adaptability to large scale dynamic sensor networks. Simulation results show that MMSPEED provides QoS differentiation in both reliability and timeliness domains and, as a result, significantly improves the effective capacity of a sensor network in terms of number of flows that meet both reliability and timeliness requirements up to 50 percent (12 flows versus 18 flows).","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2006.79","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1624344","System design;simulations;sensor networks;service differentiation;QoS;real-time;reliability;localized routing protocol.","Wireless application protocol;Intelligent networks;Wireless sensor networks;Quality of service;Temperature sensors;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Routing protocols;Temperature distribution;Large-scale systems;Temperature control","routing protocols;quality of service;telecommunication network reliability;wireless sensor networks","multipath multi-SPEED routing protocol;MMSPEED;QoS guarantee;reliability;wireless sensor networks;packet delivery mechanism;timeliness domain;geographic packet forwarding","","520","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a result, no dc-link voltage variation occurs. This leads to the possibility of making a large reduction in the size of dc-link capacitors, which are expensive, bulky, and have a lifetime limit. However, a converter current control loop inherently involves a delay in supplying the required current. In this paper, a capacitor current is nullified with a feedforward compensation term. To minimize the response delay, the authors calculate the compensation amount in terms of voltage and inject it at the voltage node. In calculating the compensation term, a differentiator is incorporated with a one-step predictor developed from converter and inverter dynamics.

Since illumination variations mainly lie in the low-frequency band, an appropriate number of DCT coefficients are truncated to minimize variations under different lighting conditions. Experimental results on the Yale B database and CMU PIE database show that the proposed approach improves the performance significantly for the face images with large illumination variations. Moreover, the advantage of our approach is that it does not require any modeling steps and can be easily implemented in a real-time face recognition system.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2005.857353","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1605391","Discrete cosine transform;face recognition;illumination normalization;logarithm transform","Lighting;Robustness;Face recognition;Discrete cosine transforms;Histograms;Image databases;Adaptive equalizers;Erbium;Shape","face recognition;feature extraction;lighting;discrete cosine transforms","illumination compensation;illumination normalization approach;robust real-time face recognition system;discrete cosine transform;DCT;logarithm transform;lighting conditions;Yale B database;CMU PIE database","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Face;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Lighting;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photography;Photometry;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","356","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, nondominated sorting genetic algorithm, niched Pareto genetic algorithm, and strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA) have been developed and successfully applied to an environmental/economic electric power dispatch problem. A new procedure for quality measure is proposed in this paper in order to evaluate different techniques. A feasibility check procedure has been developed and superimposed on MOEA to restrict the search to the feasible region of the problem space. A hierarchical clustering algorithm is also imposed to provide the power system operator with a representative and manageable Pareto-optimal set. Moreover, an approach based on fuzzy set theory is developed to extract one of the Pareto-optimal solutions as the best compromise one. These multiobjective evolutionary algorithms have been individually examined and applied to the standard IEEE 30-bus six-generator test system. Several optimization runs have been carried out on different cases of problem complexity. The results of MOEA have been compared to those reported in the literature. The results confirm the potential and effectiveness of MOEA compared to the traditional multiobjective optimization techniques.

We show that in this 2D representation, it is possible to relight all the image pixels in the same way, effectively deriving a 2D image representation which is additionally shadow-free. Finally, we show how to recover a 3D, full color shadow-free image representation by first (with the help of the 2D representation) identifying shadow edges.

This can be achieved by suitable combination of passive elements and active FACTS controllers. In this paper, series passive compensation and shunt active compensation provided by a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) connected at the electrical center of the transmission line are considered. It is possible to damp subsynchronous resonance (SSR) caused by series capacitors with the help of an auxiliary subsynchronous damping controller (SSDC) on STATCOM. The objective of this paper is to investigate the SSR characteristics of the system and propose a new design procedure for SSDC based on nonlinear optimization to meet the specifications on the damping torque in the range of critical torsional frequencies. The SSDC uses the Thevenin voltage signal to modulate the reactive current reference of STATCOM. The Thevenin voltage signal is derived from the locally available STATCOM bus voltage and reactive current signals. The STATCOM configurations considered in this paper are 12 pulse, two- and three-level voltage source converter with Type-2 and Type-1 control, respectively. The controller regulates either reactive current (supplied by the STATCOM) or the bus voltage. The 3-phase model of the STATCOM is based on switching functions. By neglecting harmonics in the switching function, D-Q model is derived which is combined with similar models of the other system components for linear analysis. The results of the linear analysis are validated by carrying out transient simulation based on the detailed nonlinear models. The study is performed on the system adapted from the IEEE First Benchmark Model.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2005.861332","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1645181","Damping torque;eigenvalue;FACTS;static synchronous compensator (STATCOM);subsynchronous damping controller (SSDC);subsynchronous resonance (SSR);torsional interaction (TI);voltage source converter (VSC)","Damping;Automatic voltage control;Voltage control;Power transmission lines;Load flow control;Shunt (electrical);Resonance;Capacitors;Design optimization;Torque","performance evaluation;static VAr compensators;load flow control;flexible AC transmission systems;torque;power transmission control;control system synthesis","performance evaluation;subsynchronous damping controller;STATCOM;transmission line;power flow control;voltage regulation;FACTS controllers;static synchronous compensator;subsynchronous resonance;nonlinear optimization;damping torque;reactive current reference;three-level voltage source converter;switching functions;linear analysis;transient simulation;IEEE first benchmark model","","126","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Because of measurement noise, the nonlinear localization equations become inconsistent; and the hyperbolae or circles no longer intersect at a single point. It is now necessary to find an emitter position estimate that minimizes its deviations from the true position. Methods that first linearize the equations and then perform gradient searches for the minimum suffer from initial condition sensitivity and convergence difficulty. Starting from the maximum likelihood (ML) function, this paper derives a closed-form approximate solution to the ML equations. When there are three sensors on a straight line, it also gives an exact ML estimate.

Each of the four different attempts to improve operating system reliability focuses on preventing buggy device drivers from crashing the system. In the Nooks approach, each driver is individually hand wrapped in a software jacket to carefully control its interactions with the rest of the operating system, but it leaves all the drivers in the kernel. The paravirtual machine approach takes this one step further and moves the drivers to one or more machines distinct from the main one, taking away even more power from the drivers. Both of these approaches are intended to improve the reliability of existing (legacy) operating systems. In contrast, two other approaches replace legacy operating systems with more reliable and secure ones. The multiserver approach runs each driver and operating system component in a separate user process and allows them to communicate using the microkernel's IPC mechanism.

The currents induced on the arrays are presented for the first time and their study reveals two distinct resonance phenomena associated with these surfaces. A new technique is presented to tailor the spectral position of the AMC operation and the EBG. Square patch arrays with fixed element size and variable periodicities are employed as working examples to demonstrate the dependence of the spectral AMC and EBG characteristics on array parameters. It is revealed that as the array periodicity is increased, the AMC frequency is increased, while the EBG frequency is reduced. This is shown to occur due to the different nature of the resonance phenomena and the associated underlying physical mechanisms that produce the two effects.

The basic problem consists of designing a PLL circuit that can track accurately and continuously the positive-sequence component at the fundamental frequency and its phase angle even when the system voltage of the bus, to which the active power line conditioner is connected, is distorted and/or unbalanced. The fundamentals of the PLL circuit are discussed. It is shown that the PLL can fail in tracking the system voltage during startup under some adverse conditions. Moreover, it is shown that oscillations caused by the presence of subharmonics can be very critical and can pull the stable point of operation synchronized to that subharmonic frequency. Oscillations at the reference input are also discussed, and the solution of this problem is presented.

To improve the linearity, an optimum gate bias is applied for the cancellation of the nonlinear harmonic generated by g/sub m3/ and a new harmonic termination technique at the common source node is adopted along with normal harmonic termination at the drain. The harmonic termination at the source effectively suppresses the second harmonic generated from the input and output.

These attacks can easily be accomplished by an adversary by either bypassing MAC-layer protocols or emitting a radio signal targeted at jamming a particular channel. In this article we survey different jamming attacks that may be employed against a sensor network. In order to cope with the problem of jamming, we discuss a two-phase strategy involving the diagnosis of the attack, followed by a suitable defense strategy. We highlight the challenges associated with detecting jamming. To cope with jamming, we propose two different but complementary approaches. One approach is to simply retreat from the interferer which may be accomplished by either spectral evasion (channel surfing) or spatial evasion (spatial retreats). The second approach aims to compete more actively with the interferer by adjusting resources, such as power levels and communication coding, to achieve communication in the presence of the jammer.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.2006.1637931","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1637931","","Jamming;Media Access Protocol;Wireless communication;Switches;Wireless sensor networks;Signal generators;Packet switching;Resumes;Energy conservation;Power supplies","wireless sensor networks;jamming;access protocols","jamming sensor networks;wireless sensor networks;radio interference;MAC-layer protocols;defense strategy;channel surfing;spatial evasion;spatial retreats","","285","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Most previous multiple-instance learning (MIL) algorithms are developed based on the assumption that a bag is positive if and only if at least one of its instances is positive. Although the assumption works well in a drug activity prediction problem, it is rather restrictive for other applications, especially those in the computer vision area. We propose a learning method, MILES (multiple-instance learning via embedded instance selection), which converts the multiple-instance learning problem to a standard supervised learning problem that does not impose the assumption relating instance labels to bag labels. MILES maps each bag into a feature space defined by the instances in the training bags via an instance similarity measure. This feature mapping often provides a large number of redundant or irrelevant features. Hence, 1-norm SVM is applied to select important features as well as construct classifiers simultaneously.

Success requires the effective interaction of two adaptive controllers: the user's brain, which produces brain activity that encodes intent, and the BCI system, which translates that activity into device control commands. In order to facilitate this interaction, many laboratories are exploring a variety of signal analysis techniques to improve the adaptation of the BCI system to the user. In the literature, many machine learning and pattern classification algorithms have been reported to give impressive results when applied to BCI data in offline analyses. However, it is more difficult to evaluate their relative value for actual online use. BCI data competitions have been organized to provide objective formal evaluations of alternative methods.

The template object is represented by multiple image fragments or patches. The patches are arbitrary and are not based on an object model (in contrast with traditional use of modelbased parts e.g. limbs and torso in human tracking). Every patch votes on the possible positions and scales of the object in the current frame, by comparing its histogram with the corresponding image patch histogram. We then minimize a robust statistic in order to combine the vote maps of the multiple patches. A key tool enabling the application of our algorithm to tracking is the integral histogram data structure [18]. Its use allows to extract histograms of multiple rectangular regions in the image in a very efficient manner. Our algorithm overcomes several difficulties which cannot be handled by traditional histogram-based algorithms [8, 6]. First, by robustly combining multiple patch votes, we are able to handle partial occlusions or pose change. Second, the geometric relations between the template patches allow us to take into account the spatial distribution of the pixel intensities - information which is lost in traditional histogram-based algorithms. Third, as noted by [18], tracking large targets has the same computational cost as tracking small targets.

Current approaches for the analysis of motion patterns depend on known scenes, where objects move in predefined ways. It is highly desirable to automatically construct object motion patterns which reflect the knowledge of the scene. In this paper, we present a system for automatically learning motion patterns for anomaly detection and behavior prediction based on a proposed algorithm for robustly tracking multiple objects. In the tracking algorithm, foreground pixels are clustered using a fast accurate fuzzy k-means algorithm. Growing and prediction of the cluster centroids of foreground pixels ensure that each cluster centroid is associated with a moving object in the scene. In the algorithm for learning motion patterns, trajectories are clustered hierarchically using spatial and temporal information and then each motion pattern is represented with a chain of Gaussian distributions. Based on the learned statistical motion patterns, statistical methods are used to detect anomalies and predict behaviors. Our system is tested using image sequences acquired, respectively, from a crowded real traffic scene and a model traffic scene. Experimental results show the robustness of the tracking algorithm, the efficiency of the algorithm for learning motion patterns, and the encouraging performance of algorithms for anomaly detection and behavior prediction","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2006.176","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1661547","Tracking multiple objects;learning statistical motion patterns;anomaly detection;behavior understanding.","Layout;Motion detection;Clustering algorithms;Pattern analysis;Motion analysis;Robustness;Tracking;Traffic control;Object detection;Gaussian distribution","Gaussian distribution;image motion analysis;image sequences;object detection;pattern classification;surveillance;target tracking","learning statistical motion patterns;anomaly detection;behavior prediction;multiple object tracking;fuzzy k-means algorithm;Gaussian distributions;image sequences;traffic scene","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Statistical;Motion;Pattern Recognition, Automated","352","","53","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An important and emerging category of such electronic systems are battery-powered mobile appliances, such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cell phones, which are severely constrained in the resources they possess, namely, processor, battery, and memory. This work focuses on one important constraint of such devices-battery life-and examines how it is impacted by the use of various security mechanisms. In this paper, we first present a comprehensive analysis of the energy requirements of a wide range of cryptographic algorithms that form the building blocks of security mechanisms such as security protocols. We then study the energy consumption requirements of the most popular transport-layer security protocol: Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). We investigate the impact of various parameters at the protocol level (such as cipher suites, authentication mechanisms, and transaction sizes, etc.) and the cryptographic algorithm level (cipher modes, strength) on the overall energy consumption for secure data transactions. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of the energy requirements of SSL. For our studies, we have developed a measurement-based experimental testbed that consists of an iPAQ PDA connected to a wireless local area network (LAN) and running Linux, a PC-based data acquisition system for real-time current measurement, the OpenSSL implementation of the SSL protocol, and parameterizable SSL client and server test programs. Based on our results, we also discuss various opportunities for realizing energy-efficient implementations of security protocols. We believe such investigations to be an important first step toward addressing the challenges of energy-efficient security for battery-constrained systems.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2006.16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1563998","Index Terms- 3DES;AES;cryptographic algorithms;DES;Diffie-Hellman;DSA;ECC;embedded system;energy analysis;handheld;low-power;RSA;security;security protocols;SSL.","Energy consumption;Cryptography;Cryptographic protocols;Data security;Personal digital assistants;Current measurement;System testing;Energy efficiency;Home appliances;Cellular phones","cryptography;mobile handsets;wireless LAN;Linux;data acquisition;telecommunication security;protocols","energy consumption;cryptographic algorithms;battery-powered mobile appliances;transport-layer security protocols;secure sockets layer;IPAQ PDA;wireless local area network;wireless LAN;Linux;PC-based data acquisition","","232","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The focus of this work is on the issues of feature extraction and classification for rear-view vehicle detection. Specifically, by treating the problem of vehicle detection as a two-class classification problem, we have investigated several different feature extraction methods such as principal component analysis, wavelets, and Gabor filters. To evaluate the extracted features, we have experimented with two popular classifiers, neural networks and support vector machines (SVMs). Based on our evaluation results, we have developed an on-board real-time monocular vehicle detection system that is capable of acquiring grey-scale images, using Ford's proprietary low-light camera, achieving an average detection rate of 10 Hz. Our vehicle detection algorithm consists of two main steps: a multiscale driven hypothesis generation step and an appearance-based hypothesis verification step. During the hypothesis generation step, image locations where vehicles might be present are extracted. This step uses multiscale techniques not only to speed up detection, but also to improve system robustness. The appearance-based hypothesis verification step verifies the hypotheses using Gabor features and SVMs. The system has been tested in Ford's concept vehicle under different traffic conditions (e.g., structured highway, complex urban streets, and varying weather conditions), illustrating good performance.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2006.877062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1643708","Gabor filters;neural networks (NNs);principal component analysis (PCA);support vector machines (SVMs);vehicle detection;wavelets","Vehicle detection;Computer vision;Feature extraction;Robustness;Remotely operated vehicles;Vehicle driving;Mobile robots;Focusing;Principal component analysis;Wavelet analysis","road vehicles;traffic engineering computing;feature extraction;image classification;principal component analysis;wavelet transforms;Gabor filters;neural nets;support vector machines;cameras","monocular precrash vehicle image detection;onroad vehicle detection;driver assistance systems;autonomous self-guided vehicles;feature extraction;rear-view vehicle detection;two-class classification problem;principal component analysis;Gabor filters;neural networks;support vector machines;grey-scale images;Ford proprietary low-light camera;multiscale driven hypothesis generation step;appearance-based hypothesis verification step;image locations;Ford concept vehicle","Accidents, Traffic;Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Motor Vehicles;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Vision, Monocular","157","","45","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Manufacturing scheduling is the process of selecting a process plan and assigning manufacturing resources for specific time periods to the set of manufacturing processes in the plan. It is, in fact, an optimization process by which limited manufacturing resources are allocated over time among parallel and sequential activities. Manufacturing process planning and scheduling are usually considered to be two separate and distinct phases. Traditional optimization approaches to these problems do not consider the constraints of both domains simultaneously and result in suboptimal solutions. Without considering real-time machine workloads and shop floor dynamics, process plans may become suboptimal or even invalid at the time of execution. Therefore, there is a need for the integration of manufacturing process-planning and scheduling systems for generating more realistic and effective plans. After describing the complexity of the manufacturing process-planning and scheduling problems, this paper reviews the research literature on manufacturing process planning, scheduling as well as their integration, particularly on agent-based approaches to these difficult problems.

First, a double-balanced Gilbert-type mixer using the current bleeding technique has been fabricated and measured for lowering flicker corner frequency. Second, a double-balanced Gilbert-type mixer using the current bleeding technique with one resonating inductor has been designed to improve conversion gain and flicker-noise performance. Third, by using two separate inductors at the node between the current bleeding device and local oscillator switches, conversion gain and flicker-noise performance are significantly improved. A conventional Gilbert-type mixer without any technique has also been fabricated and measured for comparative purposes. The Gilbert-type mixer using the current bleeding technique with two resonating inductors has a measured conversion gain of 16.1 dB, a measured input third-order intercept point of -5 dBm, a measured noise figure of 9.8 dB at 1 MHz, and a flicker corner frequency of 125 kHz while consuming only 7 mW of dc power.

However, the changes in the resonant frequencies are significantly different for the first and second resonances and, hence, a dual-band antenna with considerable frequency ratio tuning range can be obtained. Based on this technique, an electronically tunable dual-band antenna with a frequency ratio in the range of 1.2-1.65 is designed and fabricated using a single varactor with a capacitance range of 0.5-2.2 pF.

In this paper, some known results of SMV are generalized to MMV. Some of these new results take advantages of additional information in the formulation of MMV. We consider the uniqueness under both an lscr0-norm-like criterion and an lscr1-norm-like criterion. The consequent equivalence between the lscr0-norm approach and the lscr1-norm approach indicates a computationally efficient way of finding the sparsest representation in a redundant dictionary. For greedy algorithms, it is proven that under certain conditions, orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) can find the sparsest representation of an MMV with computational efficiency, just like in SMV. Simulations show that the predictions made by the proved theorems tend to be very conservative; this is consistent with some recent advances in probabilistic analysis based on random matrix theory.

State-of-the-art short-time noise reduction techniques are most often expressed as a spectral gain depending on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The well-known decision-directed (DD) approach drastically limits the level of musical noise, but the estimated a priori SNR is biased since it depends on the speech spectrum estimation in the previous frame. Therefore, the gain function matches the previous frame rather than the current one which degrades the noise reduction performance. The consequence of this bias is an annoying reverberation effect. We propose a method called two-step noise reduction (TSNR) technique which solves this problem while maintaining the benefits of the decision-directed approach. The estimation of the a priori SNR is refined by a second step to remove the bias of the DD approach, thus removing the reverberation effect. However, classic short-time noise reduction techniques, including TSNR, introduce harmonic distortion in enhanced speech because of the unreliability of estimators for small signal-to-noise ratios. This is mainly due to the difficult task of noise power spectrum density (PSD) estimation in single-microphone schemes. To overcome this problem, we propose a method called harmonic regeneration noise reduction (HRNR). A nonlinearity is used to regenerate the degraded harmonics of the distorted signal in an efficient way. The resulting artificial signal is produced in order to refine the a priori SNR used to compute a spectral gain able to preserve the speech harmonics. These methods are analyzed and objective and formal subjective test results between HRNR and TSNR techniques are provided. A significant improvement is brought by HRNR compared to TSNR thanks to the preservation of harmonics","1558-7924","","10.1109/TASL.2006.872621","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1709898","A posteriori signal-to-noise ratio (SNR);a priori SNR;harmonic regeneration;noise reduction;speech enhancement","Signal to noise ratio;Speech enhancement;Noise reduction;Working environment noise;Degradation;Reverberation;Harmonic distortion;Noise level;Spectral analysis;Performance gain","harmonic distortion;microphones;reverberation;speech enhancement","signal-to-noise ratio estimation;single-microphone speech enhancement;noisy environments;noise reduction techniques;decision-directed approach;speech spectrum estimation;reverberation effect;two-step noise reduction;harmonic distortion;noise power spectrum density;harmonic regeneration noise reduction;speech harmonics","","146","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This method is general and can be applied under the assumption that there exists repetitive patterns in a local neighborhood of a point. By introducing spatial adaptivity, we extend the work earlier described by Buades et al. which can be considered as an extension of bilateral filtering to image patches.

Because of the thin GaN cap layer, devices show minimal current-collapse effects prior to high-electric-field stress, despite the fact that they are not passivated. This comes at the price of a relatively high gate-leakage current. Under the assumption that donor-like electron traps are present within the GaN cap, two-dimensional numerical device simulations provide an explanation for the influence of the GaN cap layer on current collapse and for the correlation between the latter and the gate-leakage current. Both ON-state and OFF-state stresses produce simultaneous current-collapse increase and gate-leakage-current decrease, which can be interpreted to be the result of gate-drain surface degradation and reduced gate electron injection. This study shows that although the thin GaN cap layer is effective in suppressing surface-related dispersion effects in virgin devices, it does not, per se, protect the device from high-electric-field degradation, and it should, to this aim, be adopted in conjunction with other technological solutions like surface passivation, prepassivation surface treatments, and/or field-plate gate","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2006.885681","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4016351","AlGaN/GaN high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs);device simulation;gate lag;hot-electron degradation;hot-electron stress","","aluminium compounds;gallium compounds;high electron mobility transistors;hot carriers;III-V semiconductors;semiconductor device models;semiconductor device reliability;silicon compounds;wide band gap semiconductors","current collapse;high electric field reliability;HEMT;high-electron-mobility transistors;device simulation;gate lag;hot electron degradation;hot electron stress;GaN-AlGaN-GaN","","104","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we have laid out a theory of sensemaking that might be useful for intelligent systems applications. It's a general, empirically grounded account of sensemaking that goes significantly beyond the myths and puts forward some nonobvious, testable hypotheses about the process. When people try to make sense of events, they begin with some perspective, viewpoint, or framework - however minimal. For now, let's use a metaphor and call this a frame. We can express frames in various meaningful forms, including stories, maps, organizational diagrams, or scripts, and can use them in subsequent and parallel processes. Even though frames define what count as data, they themselves actually shape the data Furthermore, frames change as we acquire data. In other words, this is a two-way street: Frames shape and define the relevant data, and data mandate that frames change in nontrivial ways. We examine five areas of empirical findings: causal reasoning, commitment to hypotheses, feedback and learning, sense-making as a skill, and confirmation bias. In each area the Data/Frame model, and the research it's based on, doesn't align with common beliefs.

Static synchronous compensators (STATCOMs) provide a power-electronics-based means of embedded control of transmission-line voltage and power flows. The integration of energy storage with a STATCOM can extend traditional STATCOM capabilities to four-quadrant power flow control and transient stability improvement. This paper discusses energy storage systems (ESSs) integrated with conventional and multilevel bidirectional power converters for a hybrid STATCOM/ESS.

These models were trained and tested using spike train data gathered from the Fourier analysis of the input current waveform in the presence of multiple devices. The performance of these models was compared in terms of their accuracy, generalization ability, and noise tolerance limits. The results showed that MLPs and SVM were both able to determine the presence of devices based on their harmonic signatures with high accuracy.

These applications accept user inputs and use them to form SQL statements at runtime. During an SQL injection attack, an attacker might provide malicious SQL query segments as user input which could result in a different database request. By using SQL injection attacks, an attacker could thus obtain and/or modify confidential/sensitive information. An attacker could even use a SQL injection vulnerability as a rudimentary IP/Port scanner of the internal corporate network. Several papers in literature have proposed ways to prevent SQL injection attacks in the application layer by examining dynamic SQL query semantics at runtime. However, very little emphasis is laid on securing stored procedures in the database layer which could also suffer from SQL injection attacks. Some papers in literature even refer to stored procedures as a remedy against SQL injection attacks. As stored procedures reside on the database front, the methods proposed by them cannot be applied to secure stored procedures themselves. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to defend against the attacks targeted at stored procedures. This technique combines static application code analysis with runtime validation to eliminate the occurrence of such attacks. In the static part, we design a stored procedure parser, and for any SQL statement which depends on user inputs, we use this parser to instrument the necessary statements in order to compare the original SQL statement structure to that including user inputs. The deployment of this technique can be automated and used on a need-only basis. We also provide a preliminary evaluation of the results of the technique proposed, as performed on several stored procedures in the SQL Server 2005 database.","2377-5408","0-7695-2551-2","10.1109/ASWEC.2006.40","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1615052","","Application software;Runtime;Data security;Protection;Information security;Performance evaluation;Transaction databases;Internet;Computer security;Data engineering","program diagnostics;program verification;SQL;query processing;security of data;grammars","SQL injection attacks;interactive Web applications;database services;malicious SQL query segments;SQL query semantics;static application code analysis;stored procedure parser;SQL Server 2005 database","","29","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To extract a feature vector from the EMG signal, we use a wavelet packet transform that is a generalized version of wavelet transform. For dimensionality reduction and nonlinear mapping of the features, we also propose a linear-nonlinear feature projection composed of principal components analysis (PCA) and a self-organizing feature map (SOFM). The dimensionality reduction by PCA simplifies the structure of the classifier and reduces processing time for the pattern recognition. The nonlinear mapping by SOFM transforms the PCA-reduced features into a new feature space with high class separability. Finally, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) is used as the classifier. Using an analysis of class separability by feature projections, we show that the recognition accuracy depends more on the class separability of the projected features than on the MLP's class separation ability. Consequently, the proposed linear-nonlinear projection method improves class separability and recognition accuracy. We implement a real-time control system for a multifunction virtual hand. Our experimental results show that all processes, including virtual hand control, are completed within 125 ms, and the proposed method is applicable to real-time myoelectric hand control without an operational time delay","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2006.883695","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1710164","EMG;linear-nonlinear feature projection;pattern recognition;principal components analysis;self-organizing feature map;wavelet packet transform","Real time systems;Electromyography;Pattern recognition;Principal component analysis;Wavelet packets;Wavelet transforms;Feature extraction;Multilayer perceptrons;Control systems;Delay effects","electromyography;medical control systems;medical signal processing;multilayer perceptrons;pattern recognition;principal component analysis;prosthetics;self-organising feature maps;signal classification;virtual reality;wavelet transforms","real-time EMG pattern recognition system;electromyogram;linear-nonlinear feature projection;multifunction myoelectric hand;feature extraction;wavelet packet transform;wavelet transform;dimensionality reduction;principal components analysis;PCA;self-organizing feature map;SOFM;classifier;nonlinear mapping;multilayer perceptron;class separability;real-time control system;multifunction virtual hand;125 ms","Action Potentials;Artificial Intelligence;Artificial Limbs;Computer Simulation;Computer Systems;Electromyography;Hand;Humans;Linear Models;Models, Biological;Muscle, Skeletal;Nonlinear Dynamics;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Principal Component Analysis;Prosthesis Design;Robotics;User-Computer Interface","204","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The models are static polynomial, parallel Hammerstein (PH), Volterra, and radial basis-function neural network (RBFNN). Two PAs were investigated: one was designed for the third-generation (3G) mobile telecommunication systems and one was designed for the second-generation (2G). The RBFNN reduced the total model error slightly more than the PH, but the error out of band was significantly lower for the PH. The Volterra was found to give a lower model error than did a PH of the same nonlinear order and memory depth. The PH could give a lower model error than the best Volterra, since the former could be identified with a higher nonlinear order and memory depth. The qualitative conclusions are the same for the 2G and 3G PAs, but the model errors are smaller for the latter. For the 3G PA, a static polynomial gave a low model error as low as the best PH and lower than the RBFNN for the hardest cross validation.

The Shannon capacity of this MIMO broadcast channel (MIMO-BC) can be achieved using a non-linear preceding technique known as dirty paper coding (DPC) which is difficult to implement in practice. Motivated to study simpler transmission techniques, we focus on a linear precoding technique based on the zero-forcing (ZF) algorithm. In contrast to the typical sum power constraint (SPC), we consider a per-antenna power constraint (PAPC) motivated both by current antenna array designs where each antenna is powered by a separate amplifier and by future wireless networks where spatially separated antennas transmit cooperatively to users. We show that the problem of power allocation for maximizing the weighted sum rate under ZF with PAPC is a constrained convex optimization problem that can be solved using conventional numerical optimization techniques. For the special case of two users, we find an analytic solution based on waterfilling techniques. For the case where the number of users increases without bound, we show that ZF with PAPC is asymptotically optimal in the sense that the ratio of the expected sum-rate capacities between ZF with PAPC and DPC with SPC approaches one. We also show how the results can be generalized for multiple frequency bands and for a hybrid power constraint. Finally, we provide numerical results that show ZF with PAPC achieves a significant fraction of the optimum DPC sum-rate capacity in practical cases where K is bounded","1948-3252","0-7803-9710-X","10.1109/SPAWC.2006.346354","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4153898","","MIMO;Broadcasting;Transmitting antennas;Constraint optimization;Downlink;Wireless communication;Antenna arrays;Power amplifiers;Wireless networks;Frequency","antenna arrays;broadcast channels;linear codes;MIMO communication;radio links;transmitting antennas","zero-forcing precoding;MIMO broadcast channel;per-antenna power constraints;wireless communication system;Shannon capacity;dirty paper coding;linear precoding technique;sum power constraint;antenna array;constrained convex optimization problem;waterfilling techniques;sum-rate capacities","","52","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, to-date, there is very little research done in characterizing the reliability of DSRC communication based on real-world experimental data, and its effect on the reliability of vehicle safety applications. Our experimental set-up includes a fleet of three vehicles equipped with DSRC communication system, GPS receiver and a number of vehicle safety applications based on vehicle-to-vehicle communication. This paper analyzes the link-level behavior of DSRC vehicle-to-vehicle communication in a wide variety of traffic environments based on real-world experimental data. In addition, we also characterize the application level reliability of DSRC for vehicle safety communication (VSC) system. Based on our experiments, we show that the reliability of DSRC vehicle-to-vehicle communication is adequate since packet drops do not occur in bursts most of the time. We also show that the application level reliability of VSC applications based on DSRC communication is quite satisfactory. Finally, we develop an analytical model to relate application level reliability with communication reliability and VSC system parameter, laying out a clear way to improve reliability of VSC applications under harsh traffic environments. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to characterize the application-level reliability of DSRC communication for VSC applications based on real-world experimental data.

Moreover, it suggests that line currents of linear loads with sinusoidal supply voltage contain a nonsinusoidal component. This paper shows, moreover, that the IRP p-q Theory is not capable to identify power properties of three-phase loads instantaneously. A pair of instantaneous values of p and q powers does not allow us to conclude whether the load is resistive, reactive, balanced, or unbalanced.

The proposed antenna designs are based on the unique property of anti-parallel phase and group velocity of the CRLH-TL at its fundamental mode. In this mode, the propagation constant increases as the frequency decreases, therefore, a small guided wavelength can be obtained at a lower frequency to provide the small lambdag/2 resonant length used to realize a compact antenna design. Furthermore, the physical size and the operational frequency of the antenna depend on the unit cell size and the equivalent transmission line model parameters of the CRLH-TL, including series inductance, series capacitance, shunt inductance and shunt capacitance. Optimization of these parameters as well as miniaturization techniques of the physical size of unit cell is investigated. A four unit-cell resonant antenna is designed and tested at 1.06 GHz.

We use a two-stage protocol, where in one stage the transmitter sends information and in the other, the relays encode their received signals into a ""distributed"" linear dispersion (LD) code, and then transmit the coded signals to the receive node. We show that for high SNR, the pairwise error probability (PEP) behaves as (logP/P)min{TH}, with T the coherence interval, that is, the number of symbol periods during which the channels keep constant, R the number of relay nodes, and P the total transmit power. Thus, apart from the log P factor, the system has the same diversity as a multiple-antenna system with R transmit antennas, which is the same as assuming that the R relays can fully cooperate and have full knowledge of the transmitted signal. We further show that for a network with a large number of relays and a fixed total transmit power across the entire network, the optimal power allocation is for the transmitter to expend half the power and for the relays to collectively expend the other half. We also show that at low and high SNR, the coding gain is the same as that of a multiple-antenna system with R antennas.

Motion control technology has been contributed to a variety of industrial applications. The achievement of force control is one of the deep technical issues in motion control and industrial applications. Force control has been researched for more than four decades. Generally, force sensor has been utilized in force control. However, a force sensor has certain disadvantages and prevents the realization of precise force control. Especially, sensor noise causes degradation on control performance. Thus, force sensorless control has been developed. Here, both performances of a force control system with force sensor and force sensorless control system are observed in experiments. In addition, external forces are classified into reaction forces and action forces. Most force control systems are targets of reaction force control. However, action force control system is required to adopt to more variety applications. Thus, at first, reaction force control system and action force control system are described. In addition, the relationship between both force control system and control stiffness is expressed. Control stiffness is a performance index of motion control. Control stiffness is then used to evaluate the performance of both force control system.

In such applications, light-load efficiency is crucial for extending battery life, since mobile devices operate in stand-by mode for most of the time. The proposed technique adaptively reduces the inductor current ripple with decreasing load current while soft switching the converter to also reduce switching losses, thereby significantly improving light-load efficiency and therefore extending the operation life of battery-powered devices. A load-dependent, mode-hopping strategy is employed to maintain high efficiency over a wide load range. Hysteretic (sliding-mode) control with user programmable hysteresis is implemented to adaptively regulate the current ripple and therefore optimize conduction and switching losses. Experimental results show that for a 1-A, 5- to 1.8-V buck regulator, the proposed technique achieved 5% power efficiency improvement (from 72% to 77%) at 100 mA of load current and a 1.5% improvement (from 84% to 85.5%) at 300 mA, which constitute light-load efficiency improvements, when compared to the best reported, state-of-the-art techniques. As a result, the battery life in a typical digital signal processing microprocessor application is improved by 7%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed solution.","1558-3791","","10.1109/TCSII.2005.859572","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1618905","Battery life;buck converter;dc–dc converter;efficiency;hysteretic control;sliding-mode control;soft switching;switching regulator","DC-DC power converters;Switching converters;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Batteries;Switching loss;Hysteresis;Inductors;Sliding mode control;Regulators","DC-DC power convertors;low-power electronics;adaptive control;variable structure systems;electric current control;secondary cells","DC-DC converter;adaptive current-ripple control;low-voltage converters;battery life;mobile devices;inductor current ripple;switching losses;battery-powered devices;hysteretic control;sliding-mode control;user programmable hysteresis;buck regulator;digital signal processing;microprocessor;soft switching;switching regulator;1 A;100 mA;300 mA;5 to 1.8 V","","104","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The commonly used LRU policy implicitly partitions a shared cache on a demand basis, giving more cache resources to the application that has a high demand and fewer cache resources to the application that has a low demand. However, a higher demand for cache resources does not always correlate with a higher performance from additional cache resources. It is beneficial for performance to invest cache resources in the application that benefits more from the cache resources rather than in the application that has more demand for the cache resources. This paper proposes utility-based cache partitioning (UCP), a low-overhead, runtime mechanism that partitions a shared cache between multiple applications depending on the reduction in cache misses that each application is likely to obtain for a given amount of cache resources. The proposed mechanism monitors each application at runtime using a novel, cost-effective, hardware circuit that requires less than 2kB of storage. The information collected by the monitoring circuits is used by a partitioning algorithm to decide the amount of cache resources allocated to each application. Our evaluation, with 20 multiprogrammed workloads, shows that UCP improves performance of a dual-core system by up to 23% and on average 11% over LRU-based cache partitioning","2379-3155","0-7695-2732-9","10.1109/MICRO.2006.49","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041865","","Runtime;Application software;Circuits;Yarn;Hardware;Monitoring;Partitioning algorithms;Resource management;Multicore processing","cache storage;logic partitioning;microprocessor chips;multiprogramming;resource allocation","utility-based cache partitioning;runtime mechanism;LRU policy;multiprogrammed workloads;LRU-based cache partitioning;on-chip cache resource","","558","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The reflectarray consists of three layers of rectangular patch arrays separated by a honeycomb and backed by a ground plane. The beam shaping for each polarization is achieved by adjusting the phase of the reflection coefficient at each reflective element independently for each linear polarization. The phase shift for each polarization is controlled by varying either the x or y patch dimensions. The dimensions of the rectangular patches are optimized to achieve the required phase shift for each beam at central and extreme frequencies in the working band. The reflectarray has been designed to produce a contoured beam for a European coverage in H-polarization in a 10% bandwidth, and a pencil beam to illuminate the East Coast in North America in V-polarization.

Therefore, operating system (OS) plays a more important role in embedded systems to utilize various hardware and software resources. However, no OS can meet all requirements of various embedded systems. Due to the advance of reconfigurable processors, system requirements can be more dynamic. Embedded OS has becoming more critical in the development of embedded systems and thus there is a strong need of configurable embedded OS to better and faster build up the target system. In this paper, we propose a configurable OS, called COS, based on SOA (service-oriented architecture) for embedded SoC (system on a chip) systems to build an application specific OS according to the system requirements. COS can be easily configured to better utilize the resources of the target embedded platform and have better support to the embedded application. Moreover, the COS can easily extend new features or functionalities of other OSes and even be adapted to the designs of other OSes. We implement COS on an ARM platform to prove its configurability and also evaluate its overhead. We believe that COS can be configured to meet the various requirements in embedded SoC systems and help to speed up the embedded system development process","2325-1301","0-7695-2676-4","10.1109/RTCSA.2006.24","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1691319","Configurable OS;Service-Oriented Architecture;SoC;Embedded OS.","Embedded system;Kernel;System-on-a-chip;Service oriented architecture;Operating systems;Real time systems;Laboratories;Computer science;Power engineering and energy;System performance","embedded systems;operating systems (computers);reconfigurable architectures;system-on-chip;systems analysis","configurable embedded OS;embedded SoC system;embedded system on chip system;service-oriented architecture;ARM platform;embedded system development process","","1","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This metallic pattern is then modified by designing the parallel strips in a compact fashion to reduce the overall antenna dimensions and obtain a reduced-size CBSA. It is shown that, for a simple straight slot antenna, the overall occupied volume of the modified cavity backing the slot antenna can be reduced by more than 65% without affecting the high radiation efficiency of the antenna. A number of traditional cavity backed slot antennas and the proposed modified CBSAs are designed, fabricated, and measured. The reduced-size CBSAs show a very low input VSWR, low cross-polarized radiation levels, and high radiation efficiency.

Sigma-point filters use a carefully selected set of sample points to more accurately map the probability distribution than the linearization of the standard extended Kalman filter (KKF), leading to faster convergence from inaccurate initial conditions in position/attitude estimation problems. The filter formulation is based on standard inertial navigation equations. The global attitude parameterization is given by a quaternion, while a generalized three-dimensional attitude representation is used to define the local attitude error. A multiplicative quaternion-error approach is used to guarantee that quaternion normalization is maintained in the filter.

In contrast to state-of-the-art stochastic MIMO channel models, the spatial correlation properties of the channel are not divided into separate contributions from transmitter and receiver. Instead, the joint correlation properties are modeled by describing the average coupling between the eigenmodes of the two link ends. The necessary and sufficient condition for the proposed model to hold is that the eigenbasis at the receiver is independent of the transmit weights, and vice versa. The authors discuss the mathematical elements of the model, which can be easily extracted from measurements, from a radio propagation point of view and explain the underlying assumption of the model in physical terms. The validation of the proposed model by means of measured data obtained from two completely different measurement campaigns reveals its ability to better predict capacity and spatial channel structure than other popular stochastic channel models.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2006.1576533","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1576533","","Stochastic processes;MIMO;Receivers;Mathematical model;Predictive models;Radio transmitters;Sufficient conditions;Data mining;Radio propagation;Channel capacity","stochastic processes;MIMO systems;radio links;wireless channels;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","stochastic MIMO wireless radio channels;joint correlation property;link ends;multiple-input multiple-output;spatial correlation properties;transmitter;receiver;eigenmodes;radiopropagation;spatial channel structure","","329","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, loss analysis is carried out to estimate effectiveness in using SiC-based power switching devices.

Use of single supply level shifter greatly reduces the supply routing and layout congestion within the chip when level shifting is required between different voltage domains. It also reduces pin count if level shifting is required between two or more chips operating at different supply voltages in a multi-voltage system. The proposed circuit is generic in nature and the voltage range at which level shifting can be done is limited by the technology only.

Both static nonlinearities and different orders of dynamic behavior can be separately identified and the proposed representation retains the important property of linearity with respect to series coefficients. This model can, therefore, be easily extracted directly from the measured time domain of input and output samples of an amplifier by employing simple linear system identification algorithms.

As a result, speckle noise reduction is an important prerequisite, whenever ultrasound imaging is used for tissue characterization. Among the many methods that have been proposed to perform this task, there exists a class of approaches that use a multiplicative model of speckled image formation and take advantage of the logarithmical transformation in order to convert multiplicative speckle noise into additive noise. The common assumption made in a dominant number of such studies is that the samples of the additive noise are mutually uncorrelated and obey a Gaussian distribution. The present study shows conceptually and experimentally that this assumption is oversimplified and unnatural. Moreover, it may lead to inadequate performance of the speckle reduction methods. The study introduces a simple preprocessing procedure, which modifies the acquired radio-frequency images (without affecting the anatomical information they contain), so that the noise in the log-transformation domain becomes very close in its behavior to a white Gaussian noise. As a result, the preprocessing allows filtering methods based on assuming the noise to be white and Gaussian, to perform in nearly optimal conditions. The study evaluates performances of three different, nonlinear filters - wavelet denoising, total variation filtering, and anisotropic diffusion - and demonstrates that, in all these cases, the proposed preprocessing significantly improves the quality of resultant images. Our numerical tests include a series of computer-simulated and in vivo experiments.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2006.1588392","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1588392","","Biomedical imaging;Ultrasonic imaging;Speckle;Noise reduction;Additive noise;Gaussian noise;Medical diagnostic imaging;Filtering;Image resolution;Image converters","biological tissues;biomedical ultrasonics;medical image processing;image denoising;AWGN;nonlinear filters","image despeckle;medical ultrasound images;speckle noise reduction;image resolution;image contrast;tissue characterization;logarithmical transformation;additive noise;Gaussian distribution;radio-frequency images;log-transformation domain;white Gaussian noise;filtering methods;nonlinear filters;wavelet denoising;total variation filtering;anisotropic diffusion","Algorithms;Artifacts;Carotid Arteries;Echocardiography;Echocardiography;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Phantoms, Imaging;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","217","","50","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An improvement of 13-dB IIP3 is attained without significant degradation of other performance criteria like gain, noise figure, common-mode rejection ratio, etc., at similar power consumption. This is achieved by applying a newly proposed differential circuit gm"" (the second derivatives of transconductance) cancellation technique, called the differential multiple gated transistor (DMGTR). In the DMGTR amplifier, the negative value of gm"" in the fully differential amplifier can be compensated by the positive value of gm"" in the pseudo differential amplifier which is properly sized and biased. By adopting the DMGTR, a low-power highly linear RF PGA is implemented. Also, in order to have wide gain range with fine step resolution, a new RF PGA architecture is proposed.

We show that improved gait recognition can be achieved after normalization of dynamics and focusing on the shape information. We normalize for gait dynamics using a generic walking model, as captured by a population hidden Markov model (pHMM) defined for a set of individuals. The states of this pHMM represent gait stances over one gait cycle and the observations are the silhouettes of the corresponding gait stances. For each sequence, we first use Viterbi decoding of the gait dynamics to arrive at one dynamics-normalized, averaged, gait cycle of fixed length. The distance between two sequences is the distance between the two corresponding dynamics-normalized gait cycles, which we quantify by the sum of the distances between the corresponding gait stances. Distances between two silhouettes from the same generic gait stance are computed in the linear discriminant analysis space so as to maximize the discrimination between persons, while minimizing the variations of the same subject under different conditions. The distance computation is constructed so that it is invariant to dilations and erosions of the silhouettes. This helps us handle variations in silhouette shape that can occur with changing imaging conditions. We present results on three different, publicly available, data sets. First, we consider the HumanID gait challenge data set, which is the largest gait benchmarking data set that is available (122 subjects), exercising five different factors, i.e., viewpoint, shoe, surface, carrying condition, and time. We significantly improve the performance across the hard experiments involving surface change and briefcase carrying conditions. Second, we also show improved performance on the UMD gait data set that exercises time variations for 55 subjects. Third, on the CMU Mobo data set, we show results for matching across different walking speeds. It is worth noting that there was no separate training for the UMD and CMU data sets.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2006.122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1624352","Gait recognition;biometrics;LDA;gait shape;population HMM.","Legged locomotion;Shape;Biometrics;Hidden Markov models;Linear discriminant analysis;Viterbi algorithm;Decoding;Footwear;Computer displays;Computer vision","gait analysis;image recognition;biometrics (access control);hidden Markov models;image representation;Viterbi decoding","improved gait recognition;gait dynamics normalization;gait biometrics;gait shape;shape information;generic walking model;population hidden Markov model;gait stance representation;Viterbi decoding;dynamics-normalized gait cycles;linear discriminant analysis;distance computation;silhouette shape;HumanID gait challenge data set;gait benchmarking data set;surface change;briefcase carrying conditions;UMD gait data set;CMU Mobo data set;walking speeds","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biometry;Cluster Analysis;Computer Simulation;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Gait;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Markov Chains;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photography;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","214","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In a \kappa-anonymized dataset, each record is indistinguishable from at least k—1 other records with respect to certain ""identifying"" attributes. In this paper we show with two simple attacks that a \kappa-anonymized dataset has some subtle, but severe privacy problems. First, we show that an attacker can discover the values of sensitive attributes when there is little diversity in those sensitive attributes. Second, attackers often have background knowledge, and we show that \kappa-anonymity does not guarantee privacy against attackers using background knowledge. We give a detailed analysis of these two attacks and we propose a novel and powerful privacy definition called \ell-diversity. In addition to building a formal foundation for \ell-diversity, we show in an experimental evaluation that \ell-diversity is practical and can be implemented efficiently.","2375-026X","0-7695-2570-9","10.1109/ICDE.2006.1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1617392","","Medical diagnostic imaging;Publishing;Data privacy;Medical conditions;Joining processes;Insurance;Cardiac disease;Computer science;Information resources;Information analysis","","","","889","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Installing a super-capacitor as an auxiliary power source to improve the performance of electric vehicles is a feasible and realistic solution. In this paper, the structure of a multi-energy system and the principles of flow of the multi energy of electric vehicles were introduced first, explaining how different sources of energy work in different situations. A model of electric vehicle with a battery and a super-capacitor, based on Matlab/Simulink was built up. The model was validated by comparing the simulation results and the actual data from later field tests. The drive cycle used in the simulation was the CYC_CONST_45. Comparisons were made between the model of the vehicle with a super-capacitor and the model of a vehicle without a super-capacitor. Field tests of an electric vehicle were conduct and analyses were made. The analysis includes vehicle dynamic performance and economical performance in urban environments where the vehicle accelerated and decelerated frequently. The results showed that installing a super-capacitor improves the working conditions of the battery. The variation of the current drawn by the vehicle was smoothed due to the working of the super-capacitor, which provided better working conditions for the battery and increased the operating life of the battery. A super-capacitor can also improve the acceleration performance of the vehicle. The super-capacitor could provide large current in short time, delivering extra energy to meet the energy requirement when it is needed. A battery and a super-capacitor working together can reduce the average energy consumption. The average energy consumption of a vehicle with a super-capacitor is only 77% of that of a vehicle without a super-capacitor.

"Static code analysis","P. Louridas","Greek Res. & Technol. Network, Greece","IEEE Software","","2006","23","4","58","61","Programmers usually employ static checkers, it checks our programs for errors without executing them, in a process called static code analysis. In this way, it works with a program that has an initial indication of correctness (because it compiles) and try to avoid well-known traps and pitfalls before measuring it against its specifications (when it's tested). We use FindBugs, a popular open source static code checker for Java. Static code checkers in Java come in two flavors: those that work directly on the program source code and those that work on the compiled bytecode. Although each code checker works in its own way, most share some basic traits. They read the program and construct some model of it, a kind of abstract representation that they can use for matching the error patterns they recognize. They also perform some kind of data-flow analysis, trying to infer the possible values that variables might have at certain points in the program. Data-flow analysis is especially important for vulnerability checking, an increasingly important area for code checkers","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2006.114","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1657940","software testing;static checkers;debugging","Java;Computer bugs;Open source software;Insects;Inspection;Software testing","data flow analysis;Java;program testing;program verification;public domain software","static code analysis;program testing;program debugging;FindBugs;open source code checker;Java;data-flow analysis","","40","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The D-CRLH is the ""dual"" of the conventional CRLH in the sense that it has a series parallel (instead of series) LC tank and a shunt series (instead of parallel) LC tank. This topological duality results in dual properties. The D-CRLH indeed exhibits its left-handed (LH) band at high frequencies and its right-handed (RH) band at low frequencies and is of stop-band nature, in opposition to the CRLH which is low-frequency-LH/high-frequency-RH and pass-band. The so-called balanced condition is still valid in the D-CRLH for broadband matching. However, phase origin is at dc and infinity instead, as at the LH-RH transition, and the gap between the RH and LH bands cannot be closed up in practical implementations. In contrast, the D-CRLH provides an unlimited LH bandwidth.

The system is structured as a toolkit to allow the implementation of the following satellite applications: TV and sound broadcasting, interactivity (i.e., Internet access), and professional services, such as TV contribution links and digital satellite news gathering. It has been specified around three concepts: best transmission performance approaching the Shannon limit, total flexibility, and reasonable receiver complexity. Channel coding and modulation are based on more recent developments by the scientific community: low density parity check codes are adopted, combined with QPSK, 8PSK, 16APSK, and 32APSK modulations for the system to work properly on the nonlinear satellite channel. The framing structure allows for maximum flexibility in a versatile system and also synchronization in worst case configurations (low signal-to-noise ratios). Adaptive coding and modulation, when used in one-to-one links, then allows optimization of the transmission parameters for each individual user,dependant on path conditions. Backward-compatible modes are also available,allowing existing DVB-S integrated receivers-decoders to continue working during the transitional period.

Several maximum power point tracking (MPPT) methods that force the operating point to oscillate have been presented in the past few decades. In the MPPT system, the ideal operation is to determine the maximum power point (MPP) of the photovoltaic (PV) array directly rather than to track it by using the active operation of trial and error, which causes undesirable oscillation around the MPP. Since the output features of a PV cell vary with environment changes in irradiance and temperature from time to time, real-time operation is required to trace the variations of local MPPs in PV power systems. The method of real-time estimation proposed in this paper uses polynomials to demonstrate the power-voltage relationship of PV panels and implements the recursive least-squares method and Newton-Raphson method to identify the voltage of the optimal operating point. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is successfully demonstrated by computer simulations and experimental evaluations of two major types of PV panels, namely: 1) crystalline silicon and 2) copper-indium-diselenide thin film","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2006.878355","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1667899","Curve fitting;least-squares method (LS);Newton–Raphson method (NRM);parameter estimation;photovoltaic (PV) power systems;polynomials;real-time systems","Real time systems;Photovoltaic systems;Control systems;Solar power generation;Temperature;Power system simulation;Recursive estimation;Polynomials;Newton method;Voltage","least squares approximations;Newton-Raphson method;photovoltaic power systems;power engineering computing;solar cell arrays","real-time identification;photovoltaic power systems;maximum power point tracking methods;photovoltaic array;real-time estimation;power voltage relationship;recursive least squares method;Newton-Raphson method;computer simulations","","171","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the performance of SVM-based relevance feedback is often poor when the number of labeled positive feedback samples is small. This is mainly due to three reasons: 1) an SVM classifier is unstable on a small-sized training set, 2) SVM's optimal hyperplane may be biased when the positive feedback samples are much less than the negative feedback samples, and 3) overfitting happens because the number of feature dimensions is much higher than the size of the training set. In this paper, we develop a mechanism to overcome these problems. To address the first two problems, we propose an asymmetric bagging-based SVM (AB-SVM). For the third problem, we combine the random subspace method and SVM for relevance feedback, which is named random subspace SVM (RS-SVM). Finally, by integrating AB-SVM and RS-SVM, an asymmetric bagging and random subspace SVM (ABRS-SVM) is built to solve these three problems and further improve the relevance feedback performance","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2006.134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1634340","Classifier committee learning;content-based image retrieval;relevance feedback;asymmetric bagging;random subspace;support vector machines.","Bagging;Image retrieval;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Negative feedback;Content based retrieval;Radio frequency;Machine learning;Algorithm design and analysis;Pattern classification","content-based retrieval;image classification;image retrieval;relevance feedback;support vector machines","asymmetric bagging;random subspace method;support vector machines;relevance feedback;content-based image retrieval","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Database Management Systems;Databases, Factual;Feedback;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated","556","","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Control allocators compute the commands that are applied to the actuators so that a certain set of forces or moments are generated by the control effectors.

Because the quaternion kinematics equation is linear, the combination of the two yields a linear KF that eliminates the usual linearization procedure and is less sensitive to initial estimation errors. General accurate expressions for the covariance matrices of the system state-dependent noises are developed. In addition, an analysis shows how to compute these covariance matrices efficiently. An adaptive version of the filter is also developed to handle modeling errors of the dynamic system noise statistics.

It integrates the terminal voltage of the unenergized winding that contains the back electromotive force (EMF) information and uses a phase-locked loop (PLL) to determine the proper commutation sequence for the BLDC motor. However, even without pulsewidth modulation, the terminal voltage is distorted by voltage pulses due to the freewheel diode conduction. The pulses, which appear very wide in an ultrahigh-speed (120 kr/min) drive, are also integrated by the ASIC. Consequently, the motor commutation is significantly retarded, and the drive performance is deteriorated. In this paper, it is proposed that the ASIC should integrate the third harmonic back EMF instead of the terminal voltage, such that the commutation retarding is largely reduced and the motor performance is improved. Basic principle and implementation of the new ASIC-based sensorless controller will be presented, and experimental results will be given to verify the control strategy. On the other hand, phase delay in the motor currents arises due to the influence of winding inductance, reducing the drive performance. Therefore, a novel circuit with discrete components is proposed. It also uses the integration of third harmonic back EMF and the PLL technique and provides controllable advanced commutation to the BLDC motor.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2006.870664","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1614125","Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC);brushless direct current (BLDC) motor;phase-locked loop (PLL);sensorless control;third harmonic back electromotive force (EMF);ultrahigh-speed motor","Sensorless control;Brushless motors;Phase locked loops;Brushless DC motors;Application specific integrated circuits;Voltage;Commutation;DC motors;Pulse modulation;Motor drives","phase locked loops;application specific integrated circuits;permanent magnet motors;brushless DC motors;DC motor drives;electric potential;pulse width modulation;machine windings;machine control;commutation","sensorless control;phase locked loop;PLL;back electromotive force;EMF;application-specific integrated circuit;ASIC;ML4425;permanent-magnet brushless direct current;motor drives;pulse width modulation;freewheel diode conduction;phase delay;winding inductance;ultrahigh-speed motor","","108","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To determine whether the current pixel is corrupted, the proposed BDND algorithm first classifies the pixels of a localized window, centering on the current pixel, into three groups-lower intensity impulse noise, uncorrupted pixels, and higher intensity impulse noise. The center pixel will then be considered as ""uncorrupted,"" provided that it belongs to the ""uncorrupted"" pixel group, or ""corrupted."" For that, two boundaries that discriminate these three groups require to be accurately determined for yielding a very high noise detection accuracy-in our case, achieving zero miss-detection rate while maintaining a fairly low false-alarm rate, even up to 70% noise corruption. Four noise models are considered for performance evaluation. Extensive simulation results conducted on both monochrome and color images under a wide range (from 10% to 90%) of noise corruption clearly show that our proposed switching median filter substantially outperforms all existing median-based filters, in terms of suppressing impulse noise while preserving image details, and yet, the proposed BDND is algorithmically simple, suitable for real-time implementation and application.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2005.871129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1632204","Image denoising;impulse noise detection;nonlinear filter;switching median filter","Nonlinear filters;Degradation;Noise reduction;Colored noise;Image quality;Noise robustness;Samarium;Information filtering;Information filters;Pixel","median filters;image denoising;image colour analysis;impulse noise","switching median filter;boundary discriminative noise detection;corrupted images;impulse noise detection method;color images;impulse noise suppression","Algorithms;Artifacts;Discriminant Analysis;Filtration;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","311","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To overcome the problem of intermittent power generation, PV power systems may be integrated with other power sources. Fuel cells are an attractive option because of high efficiency, modularity and fuel flexibility; however, one main week point is their slow dynamics. On the other hand, current technology batteries by themselves are usually insufficient to provide the long-term energy that the increasing loads require. Hybrid systems composed of fuel cells and batteries can be integrated with PV power systems to provide uninterrupted high-quality power. The goal of this study is to design an effective power management system for a PV/fuel cell/battery hybrid power system so that the combination can be used as a reliable power source.

Since sub-threshold voltages leave less room for large static noise margin (SNM), a thorough understanding of the impact of various design decisions and other parameters becomes critical. This paper analyzes SNM for sub-threshold bitcells in a 65-nm process for its dependency on sizing, VDD, temperature, and local and global threshold variation.

In the LSB matching, the choice of whether to add or subtract one from the cover image pixel is random. The new method uses the choice to set a binary function of two cover pixels to the desired value. The embedding is performed using a pair of pixels as a unit, where the LSB of the first pixel carries one bit of information, and a function of the two pixel values carries another bit of information. Therefore, the modified method allows embedding the same payload as LSB matching but with fewer changes to the cover image. The experimental results of the proposed method show better performance than traditional LSB matching in terms of distortion and resistance against existing steganalysis.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2006.870357","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1618698","Information hiding;steganography","Pixel;Steganography;Histograms;Payloads;Gray-scale;Terminology;Detectors;Information technology;Calibration;Signal processing algorithms","data encapsulation;image matching","least-significant-bit matching;LSB;steganographic method;binary function;cover image;distortion;steganalysis","","477","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Civilian applications include monitoring forest fires, oil fields, and pipelines and tracking wildlife. Applications to homeland security include border patrol and monitoring the perimeter of nuclear power plants. Military applications are numerous. The current approach to these applications is to use a single manned vehicle for surveillance. However, manned vehicles are typically large and expensive. In addition, hazardous environments and operator fatigue can potentially threaten the life of the pilot. Therefore, there is a critical need for automating aerial surveillance using unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). This paper gives an overview of a cooperative control strategy for aerial surveillance that has been successfully flight tested on small (48-in wingspan) UAVs. Our approach to cooperative control problems can be summarized in four steps: 1) the definition of a cooperation constraint and cooperation objective; 2) the definition of a coordination variable as the minimal amount of information needed to effect cooperation; 3) the design of a centralized cooperation strategy; and 4) the use of consensus schemes to transform the centralized strategy into a decentralized algorithm.

Further, the input-series connection enables the use of low-voltage MOSFETs that are optimized for very low RDSON , thus, resulting in lower conduction losses. In the proposed scheme, the duty ratio to all the converter modules connected in input-series and output-parallel (ISOP) configuration is made common. This scheme does not require a dedicated input-voltage or load-current-share controller. It relies on the inherent self-correcting characteristic of the ISOP connection when the duty ratio of all the converters is the same.

It is demonstrated that the characteristic current densities also remain invariant for the most common circuit topologies such as MOSFET cascodes, MOS-SiGe HBT cascodes, current-mode logic (CML) gates, and nMOS transimpedance amplifiers (TIAs) with active pMOSFET loads. As a consequence, it is proposed that constant current-density biasing schemes be applied to MOSFET analog/mixed-signal/RF and high-speed digital circuit design. This will alleviate the problem of ever-diminishing effective gate voltages as CMOS is scaled below 90 nm, and will reduce the impact of statistical process variation, temperature and bias current variation on circuit performance. The second half of the paper illustrates that constant current-density biasing allows for the porting of SiGe BiCMOS cascode operational amplifiers, low-noise CMOS TIAs, and MOS-CML and BiCMOS-CML logic gates and output drivers between technology nodes and foundries, and even from bulk CMOS to SOI processes, with little or no redesign.

All three methods utilize the output voltage switching ripple for pulse-width modulation (PWM), hence, are collectively referred to as ripple-based control. A general modeling method based on the Krylov-Bogoliubov-Mitropolsky ripple estimation technique is applied to develop averaged models for single-channel as well as multichannel buck converters employing each of the control methods. Unlike existing models that are limited to small-signal operation, the proposed models are valid for large-signal operation and are capable of predicting subharmonic instability without including any sample-and-hold block as used in previous models. The paper also shows that adding parallel, high-quality ceramic capacitors at the output, which are ignored in previous models, can lead to pulse skipping and ripple instability, and a solution based on proper selection of the ceramic capacitors and/or ramp compensation at the PWM is presented. The models are further applied to analyze and compare the performance of the three control methods in terms of ripple stability, effective load current feedforward gain, and output impedance.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2005.869747","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1603666","Averaged modeling;enhanced;load current feedforward;ripple-based control;ripple estimation;ripple instability;voltage regulator modules (VRMs);VRM control","Voltage control;Regulators;Pulse width modulation;Predictive models;Space vector pulse width modulation;Ceramics;Capacitors;Output feedback;Buck converters;Performance analysis","voltage regulators;control system analysis;PWM power convertors;ceramic capacitors","ripple-based control;voltage regulator;enhanced V/sup 2/ control;voltage switching ripple;pulse-width modulation;PWM;Krylov-Bogoliubov-Mitropolsky ripple estimation;multichannel buck converters;subharmonic instability;ceramic capacitors;pulse skipping;load current feedforward gain;output impedance","","119","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The effectiveness of passive islanding detection methods (IDMs) is usually demonstrated by means of nondetection zones (NDZs) represented in a power mismatch space (/spl Delta/P versus /spl Delta/Q). Active frequency drifting IDMs have been shown to provide improved performance but their theoretical NDZ cannot be described in the /spl Delta/P versus /spl Delta/Q space for a general RLC load. This paper shows that a load parameter space based on the values of the quality factor and resonant frequency of the local load (Q/sub f/ versus f/sub 0/) can be used in these cases. It employs a single curve to represent the NDZ of frequency drifting IDMs for any RLC loads. Equations that represent NDZs of three common active IDMs in the Q/sub f/ versus f/sub 0/ load parameter space are derived and it is shown that the slip mode frequency shift and the Sandia frequency shift IDMs can be designed to guarantee islanding detection for equivalent RLC loads with a quality factor smaller than a design value.

All basic properties of f-divergences including relations to the decision errors are proved in a new manner replacing the classical Jensen inequality by a new generalized Taylor expansion of convex functions. Some new properties are proved too, e.g., relations to the statistical sufficiency and deficiency. The generalized Taylor expansion also shows very easily that all f-divergences are average statistical informations (differences between prior and posterior Bayes errors) mutually differing only in the weights imposed on various prior distributions. The statistical information introduced by De Groot and the classical information of Shannon are shown to be extremal cases corresponding to alpha=0 and alpha=1 in the class of the so-called Arimoto alpha-informations introduced in this paper for 0<alpha<1 by means of the Arimoto alpha-entropies. Some new examples of f-divergences are introduced as well, namely, the Shannon divergences and the Arimoto alpha-divergences leading for alphauarr1 to the Shannon divergences. Square roots of all these divergences are shown to be metrics satisfying the triangle inequality.

Our approach requires neither an explicit body model nor prior labeling of body parts in the image. Instead, it recovers pose by direct nonlinear regression against shape descriptor vectors extracted automatically from image silhouettes. For robustness against local silhouette segmentation errors, silhouette shape is encoded by histogram-of-shape-contexts descriptors. We evaluate several different regression methods: ridge regression, relevance vector machine (RVM) regression, and support vector machine (SVM) regression over both linear and kernel bases. The RVMs provide much sparser regressors without compromising performance, and kernel bases give a small but worthwhile improvement in performance. The loss of depth and limb labeling information often makes the recovery of 3D pose from single silhouettes ambiguous. To handle this, the method is embedded in a novel regressive tracking framework, using dynamics from the previous state estimate together with a learned regression value to disambiguate the pose. We show that the resulting system tracks long sequences stably. For realism and good generalization over a wide range of viewpoints, we train the regressors on images resynthesized from real human motion capture data. The method is demonstrated for several representations of full body pose, both quantitatively on independent but similar test data and qualitatively on real image sequences. Mean angular errors of 4-6/spl deg/ are obtained for a variety of walking motions.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2006.21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542030","Index Terms- Computer vision;human motion estimation;machine learning;multivariate regression.","Humans;Image sequences;Labeling;Shape;Support vector machines;Kernel;Learning systems;Biological system modeling;Robustness;Image segmentation","computer vision;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis;support vector machines;image motion analysis;image sequences","monocular image sequences;3D human pose;learning-based method;nonlinear regression;shape descriptor vectors;image silhouettes;silhouette shape;histogram-of-shape-contexts descriptors;ridge regression;relevance vector machine regression;support vector machine regression;human motion estimation","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Joints;Joints;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photography;Posture;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","454","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The transceiver has been designed to meet all narrowband blocker, newly proposed Adjacent Channel II, and Category 10 HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access) requirements. The design is part of a reconfigurable reference platform for multi-band, multi-mode (GSM/EDGE + WCDMA) radios. The zero-IF receiver is comprised of a novel multi-band quadrature mixer, seventh-order baseband filtering, and a novel DC offset correction scheme, which exhibits no settling time or peak switching transients after gain steps. The receiver lineup is designed to optimize HSDPA throughput and minimize sensitivity to analog baseband filter bandwidth variations. The direct-launch transmitter is made up of a third-order baseband filter, an I/Q modulator with variable gain, an integrated transformer, an RF variable gain amplifier, and a power amplifier driver. At +9.5-dBm output power, the transmitter achieves an error vector magnitude (EVM) of 4%. Fractional-N synthesizers achieve fast lock times of 50 /spl mu/s (150 /spl mu/s) within 20 ppm (0.1 ppm). Automatically calibrated, integrated VCOs achieve a 1.6-GHz tuning range to facilitate coverage over all six 3GPP frequency bands. The IC draws 34 mA in receive (18-mA receiver plus 16-mA fractional-N PLL/VCO) and 50 to 62 mA in transmit (-76 dBm to +9.5 dBm), including PLL/VCO, using a 2.775-V supply voltage. The RF transceiver is integrated with the baseband signal processing and associated passives in a 165-pad package, resulting in the first tri-band 3G radio transceiver with a digital interface which requires no external components.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2006.872743","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1624402","Carrier leakage;DCOC;digital interface;direct conversion;direct launch;EDGE;EVM;fractional-N;HSDPA;multi-band;multi-mode;transceiver;UMTS;WCDMA;3G","Multiaccess communication;Transceivers;Baseband;Power amplifiers;Filters;Radio transmitters;Gain;Radio frequency;Radiofrequency amplifiers;Phase locked loops","3G mobile communication;cellular radio;UHF integrated circuits;frequency synthesizers;transceivers;code division multiple access;voltage-controlled oscillators;high-speed integrated circuits","single-chip tri-band cellular transceiver;WCDMA cellular transceiver;HSDPA cellular transceiver;narrowband blocker;adjacent channel II;category 10 HSDPA;high speed downlink packet access;multi-band multi-mode radios;zero-IF receiver;multi-band quadrature mixer;seventh-order baseband filtering;DC offset correction scheme;analog baseband filter;direct-launch transmitter;third-order baseband filter;I-Q modulator;RF variable gain amplifier;power amplifier driver;integrated VCO;tri-band 3G radio transceiver;16 mA;18 mA;34 mA;50 to 62 mA;1.9 GHz;2.1 GHz;800 MHz;850 MHz;50 mus;150 mus;2.7775 V","","57","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A patch antenna tested the performance of the magnetic metamaterial as a substrate and validated that a single substrate can achieve a range of miniaturization values. The effective medium metamaterial substrate employed electromagnetically small embedded circuits (ECs) to achieve permeability and permittivity greater than that of the host dielectric. Geometric control of the ECs allowed mu and epsi to be tailored to the application. The magnetic metamaterial exhibited enhanced mu and epsi with acceptable loss-factor levels. Models for predicting mu and epsi are presented, the benefits of employing metamaterial substrates are discussed, and the results in this antenna experiment are presented. The metamaterial exhibits performance characteristics not achievable from natural materials. Of particular significance is that with the permeability varying strongly and predictably with frequency, the miniaturization factor may be selected by tuning the operating frequency. Simulations indicate that such performance can be extended to several gigahertz with current technology. Relative permeability values in the mur=1-5 range are achievable for moderately low-loss applications.

"A New State Estimation Model of Utilizing PMU Measurements","H. Zhao","Fu Jian Province Power Company Limited","2006 International Conference on Power System Technology","","2006","","","1","5","The PMU can measure voltage phasors of the PMU node and current phasors of the correlative branch, and voltage phasors of the correlative nodes can be calculated by PMU measurements, so the state variable of these nodes are known. Two ways of research on the state estimation(SE) with PMU measurements are: one regards the PMU measurements as normal measurements and uses them together with SCADA measurements in the nonlinear state estimation; the other is linear state estimation with only PMU measurements on the condition that the system is observable fully with PMUs. The former has not considered the PMU's ability of measuring state variables, and the latter is difficult to realize now. Considering the high measurement precision and reliability of the PMU, the paper gives a new model to regard the state variable measured or calculated by PMU as the state variable of nodes in the state estimation. The model can utilize the PMU's ability of measuring state variables, reduce the scale of estimator. The improvement of calculating time- consuming and convergence speed in the new model is analyzed by the simulation. In the new SE model, the weight of PMU measurements is assumed to be infinite, and not equal to the variance reciprocal of measurements error, so the state estimation precision is influenced by the weight departure of the PMU measurements. The paper analyses and expands the new model more deeply, and presents a double state estimation model: at first, the nonlinear SE is done on the condition of taking the state variable measured or calculated by PMU as the state variable of nodes, then the linear SE is done with both nonlinear SE results and PMU measurements. The model adds little calculation time, but improves the SE equations' convergence speed and estimation precision simultaneously. The double state estimation model is validated by the simulation.","","1-4244-0110-0","10.1109/ICPST.2006.321443","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4116086","state estimation;PMU measurements;double state estimation","State estimation;Phasor measurement units;Convergence;Nonlinear equations;Measurement errors;Difference equations;Current measurement;Voltage;Power system modeling;Area measurement","phase measurement;power system measurement;state estimation","state estimation model;PMU measurements;voltage phasors;current phasors;double state estimation","","21","","2","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, the impact of cycling at different DODs on LMP battery cycling performances was investigated. The depth of discharge was correlated to capacity fade and coulombic efficiency. Various cycling protocols covering a range of DODs have been applied to LMP cells at 43 degC and 60 degC.

This paper proposes a residual test (RT) that can simultaneously determine the number of line-of-sight (LOS) BS and identify them. Then, localization can proceed with only those LOS BS. The RT works on the principle that when all measurements are LOS, the normalized residuals have a central Chi-Square distribution, versus a noncentral distribution when there is NLOS. The residuals are the squared differences between the estimates and the true position. Normalization by their variances gives a unity variance to the resultant random variables. In simulation studies, for the chosen geometry and NLOS and measurement noise errors, the RT can determine the correct number of LOS-BS over 90% of the time. For four or more BS, where there are at least three LOS-BS, the estimator has variances that are near the Cramer--Rao lower bound.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2005.861207","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1583910","Mobile positioning;non-line-of-sight (NLOS);time-of-arrival (ToA)","Base stations;Testing;Geometry;Random variables;Solid modeling;Noise measurement;Time measurement;Error correction;Mobile handsets;Global Positioning System","time-of-arrival estimation;mobile communication","time-of-arrival based localization;NLOS conditions;base stations;mobile station;nonline-of-sight path;residual test;chi-square distribution","","293","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Typically, an HEV combines two power trains, a conventional power source such as a gasoline engine, a diesel engine, or a fuel cell stack, and an electric drive system (involving a motor and a generator) to produce driving power with a potential of higher fuel economy than conventional vehicles. Furthermore, such vehicles do not require external charging and thus work within the existing fueling infrastructures. The power-split power train configuration of an HEV has the individual advantages of the series and parallel types of HEV power train configurations. A sophisticated control system, however, is required to manage the power-split HEV power trains. Designing such a control system requires a reasonably accurate HEV system plant model. Much research has been done for developing dynamic plant models for the series and parallel types, but a complete and validated dynamic model for the power-split HEV power train is still in its infancy. This paper presents a power-split power train HEV dynamic model capable of realistically replicating all the major steady-state and transient phenomena appearing under different driving conditions. A mathematical derivation and modeling representation of this plant model and its components is shown first. Next, the analysis, verification, and validation through computer simulation and comparison with the data actually measured in the test vehicle at the Ford Motor Company's test track is performed. The excellent agreements between the model and the experimental results demonstrate the fidelity and validity of the derived plant model. Since this plant model was built by integrating the subsystem models using a system-oriented approach with a hierarchical methodology, it is easy to change subsystem functionalities. The developed plant model is useful for analyzing and understanding the dominant dynamics of the power train system, the interaction between subsystems and components, and system transients due to the change of operational state and the influence of disturbances. This plant model can also be employed for the development of vehicle system controllers, evaluation of energy management strategies, issue resolution, and verification of coded algorithms, among many other purposes","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2006.878563","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4012546","Electronic-continuously variable transmission (e-CVT);derivation;hybrid electric vehicle (HEV);modeling;power-split;simulation;validation","Hybrid electric vehicles;Power system modeling;Vehicle dynamics;Diesel engines;Energy management;Control system synthesis;Mathematical model;Testing;Petroleum;Fuel cells","energy management systems;hybrid electric vehicles","power-split hybrid electric vehicle model;HEV system plant model;steady-state phenomena;transient phenomena;mathematical derivation;computer simulation;Ford Motor Company's test track;system-oriented approach;vehicle system controller;energy management strategy","","83","","41","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Together with the continuing trend of reduction in device dimensions this has led to dramatic increase in the thermal issues within electronic circuits. Thermal management is therefore becoming increasingly more critical and fundamental to ensuring that electronic devices operate within their specification. Although a thermal management system may make use of all modes of heat transfer to maintain temperatures within their appropriate limits and to ensure optimum performance and reliability, conductive heat transfer is typically used to spread the heat out from its point of generation and into the extended surface area of a heat sink. To minimise the contact resistance, thermal interface materials (TIMs) are introduced to the joint to fill the air gaps and are an essential part of an assembly when solid surfaces are attached together. This paper reviews the conventional interface materials and then goes on to present a comprehensive review of the emerging state-of-the-art research in the use of carbon nanotube based materials.

Straining silicon fundamentally changes the mechanical, electrical (band structure and mobility), and chemical (diffusion and activation) properties. As silicon is strained and subjected to high-temperature thermal processing, it undergoes mechanical deformations that create defects, which may significantly limit yield. Engineers have to manipulate these properties of silicon to balance the performance gains against defect generation. This paper will elucidate the current understanding and ongoing published efforts on all these critical properties in bulk strained silicon. The manifestation of these properties in CMOS transistor performance and designs that successfully harness strain is reviewed in the last section. Current manufacturable strained-silicon technologies are reviewed with particular emphasis on scalability.

First, the energy conservation principle is adopted to build a mathematical model of the motor-mechanism-coupled system. Moreover, an adaptive sliding-mode control system is developed for stabilizing and tracking control of the dual-axis inverted-pendulum system, where an adaptive algorithm is investigated to relax the requirement of the bound of lumped uncertainty in the traditional sliding-mode control.

With the digital implementation, the proposed scheme shows a much more precise control of the leakage cancellation when compared to conventional analog implementations. The dc-offset problem in analog mixers that affects the cancellation performance is eliminated. A radar test bed at 26 GHz has been built and tested in several radar modes.

This paper addresses both the architecture and the circuits for the RF front-end of a terminal with cellular (GSM, EDGE and UMTS), LAN (IEEE802.11a/b/g) and Bluetooth radio interfaces. A multi-standard simulator has been developed to validate the architectural and design choices in terms of error rates at bit or packet level. The simulator takes into account implementation non-idealities and performs all tests to be passed to comply with the given standards. It also hints at the need for implementation margins as well as at possible optimization between different RF-blocks. The final solution, still under design, will consists of two chips, one including the TX and the other the RX for all the above standards. The cellular (plus Bluetooth) transmitter relies on a Linear amplification with Non-linear Component (LINC) architecture that uses direct modulation of the carrier. This allows power saving because DAC and up-conversion mixers are not required. The WLAN (plus Bluetooth) transmitter adopts a direct-conversion architecture that implements an internal output matching over all the frequency bands while maintaining good system efficiency. The same building blocks are used for all standards, saving power and chip area. The cellular receiver architecture is able to reconfigure between Low-IF for GSM and direct conversion for UMTS and Bluetooth. The key aspects in achieving the specs in a fully integrated fashion are a mixer with a very high dynamic range, a careful control of DC offsets and a highly tunable VCO. The WLAN receiver also uses direct-conversion with a Low Noise Amplifier based on a common gate topology that uses positive feedback through integrated transformers to improve input matching and noise. The frequency down-converter uses current driven passive mixers to achieve low 1/f noise corner, and high linearity with low power consumption. Finally, the base-band blocks can be shared among all the standard, thanks to their high reconfigurability. The paper describes the ideas behind the key RF blocks and some details of circuit implementation. Experimental measurements from sub-blocks in a 0.13 /spl mu/m CMOS technology are presented and discussed.","1558-0830","","10.1109/MCAS.2006.1607637","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607637","","System analysis and design;Radio frequency;Bluetooth;GSM;3G mobile communication;Circuit simulation;Radio transmitters;Wireless LAN;Impedance matching;CMOS technology","reconfigurable architectures;cellular radio;3G mobile communication;wireless LAN;Bluetooth;circuit simulation","wireless multi-standard terminals;system analysis;system design;reconfigurable RF front-end;GSM;EDGE;UMTS;LAN;IEEE802.11a/b/g;Bluetooth radio interfaces;multi-standard simulator;error rates;linear amplification with non-linear component architecture;mixer;DC offset;tunable VCO;low noise amplifier;positive feedback;integrated transformers;input matching;input noise;frequency down-converter;current driven passive mixers;base-band blocks;0.13 micron","","62","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

RNC makes decision on which channel is used by which BS at super-frame level and BSs then make decision on which user is assigned to which channel at frame-level. Two optimization problems for RNC and BSs are formulated and computationally efficient algorithms that perform the function of interference avoidance and traffic/channel adaptation are developed.

The problem of dc-side voltage ripple and ac-side harmonics generation due to unbalanced voltages/currents is solved by using switching function modulation, enabling the use of a relatively small capacitor on the dc side. The control algorithm is also suitable for high-power applications using multipulse voltage-source converters.

Dept., Rutgers Univ., Newark, NJ, USA; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","","2006","18","3","304","319","Removing objects that are noisy is an important goal of data cleaning as noise hinders most types of data analysis. Most existing data cleaning methods focus on removing noise that is the product of low-level data errors that result from an imperfect data collection process, but data objects that are irrelevant or only weakly relevant can also significantly hinder data analysis. Thus, if the goal is to enhance the data analysis as much as possible, these objects should also be considered as noise, at least with respect to the underlying analysis. Consequently, there is a need for data cleaning techniques that remove both types of noise. Because data sets can contain large amounts of noise, these techniques also need to be able to discard a potentially large fraction of the data. This paper explores four techniques intended for noise removal to enhance data analysis in the presence of high noise levels. Three of these methods are based on traditional outlier detection techniques: distance-based, clustering-based, and an approach based on the local outlier factor (LOF) of an object. The other technique, which is a new method that we are proposing, is a hyperclique-based data cleaner (HCleaner). These techniques are evaluated in terms of their impact on the subsequent data analysis, specifically, clustering and association analysis. Our experimental results show that all of these methods can provide better clustering performance and higher quality association patterns as the amount of noise being removed increases, although HCleaner generally leads to better clustering performance and higher quality associations than the other three methods for binary data.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2006.46","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1583581","Index Terms- Data cleaning;very noisy data;hyperclique pattern discovery;local outlier factor (LOF);noise removal.","Data analysis;Cleaning;Proteins;Noise level;Object detection;Computer Society;Computer errors;Text analysis;Error analysis","data analysis;pattern clustering;noise;data mining","data analysis;noise removal;distance-based technique;clustering-based technique;local outlier factor;hyperclique-based data cleaner;HCleaner;data mining","","90","","43","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It employs the three-arm rectifier-inverter topology with PV modules connected directly on the dc-link. The common-arm is with line-frequency switching and synchronous to the input voltage, aiming for a lower switching loss and decoupling the control of rectifier and inverter portions. As a result, the rectifier and inverter portions can be controlled independently with the rectifier-arm and inverter-arm, respectively. For maximum power point tracking (MPFF) of the PV modules and balancing the power among utility, PV, and the load, a variable dc-link voltage is adopted and controlled by the rectifier-arm based on the MPPT control algorithm. The inverter-arm then regulates the load voltage with good regulation and low distortion. Due to large variation of the dc-link voltage, a feedforward plus feedback control technique with variable gain is developed to keep constant bandwidth of the current loop at any operation condition. Therefore, the performance of the rectifier and inverter portions can be ensured.

However, another special system for indoor localization is needed in the complicated indoor environment, where the Global Positioning System (GPS) is not available. RFID technology makes the building up of indoor localization system with low cost possible. LANDMARC is an indoor localization system using RFID technology, which introduces the concept of reference tag to reduce the number of deployed RFID readers and provides high possibility to be used in reality, and we can guarantee the accuracy of localization and thus lower the cost of importing system with it. In this paper, we analyze the existing LANDMARC system, solve the potential problems within it and propose a more efficient mechanism to enhance the accuracy of indoor localization","","0-7695-2553-9","10.1109/SUTC.2006.1636157","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1636157","","Active RFID tags;Technical Activities Guide -TAG;Radiofrequency identification;Ubiquitous computing;Global Positioning System;Costs;Indoor environments;Sensor systems;Computer networks;Pervasive computing","indoor radio;mobile computing;radiofrequency identification","location-aware technology;ubiquitous computing;indoor localization mechanism;RFID technology;radiofrequency identification;LANDMARC system","","46","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Chattering Problem in Sliding Mode Control Systems","V. Utkin; Hoon Lee","Ohio State Univ., Columbus, OH; Ohio State Univ., Columbus, OH","International Workshop on Variable Structure Systems, 2006. VSS'06.","","2006","","","346","350","In practical applications of sliding mode control, engineers may experience undesirable phenomenon of oscillations having finite frequency and amplitude, which is known as `chattering'. At the first stage of sliding mode control theory development the chattering was the main obstacle for its implementation. The major attention was paid to the systems with motion equations in canonical space - space of a system output and its high order derivatives. Small time constants of real differentiators could not be disregarded, if control actions were discontinuous state functions, and they led to oscillations in the vicinity of discontinuity surfaces in the system state space. Chattering is a harmful phenomenon because it leads to low control accuracy, high wear of moving mechanical parts, and high heat losses in power circuits. There are two reasons which can lead to chattering. Similarly to the systems in canonical space, the chattering can be caused by fast dynamics which were neglected in the ideal model. These `unmodeled' dynamics with small time constants are usually disregarded in models of servomechanisms, sensors and data processors. The second reason of chattering is utilization of digital controllers with finite sampling rate, which causes so called `discretization chatter'. Theoretically the ideal sliding mode implies infinite switching frequency. Since the control is constant within a sampling interval, switching frequency can not exceed that of sampling, which lead to chattering as well","2158-3986","1-4244-0208-5","10.1109/VSS.2006.1644542","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1644542","","Sliding mode control;Sampling methods;Power system modeling;Switching frequency;Equations;Control systems;State-space methods;Temperature control;Circuits;Servomechanisms","control nonlinearities;discrete systems;state-space methods;variable structure systems","chattering problem;sliding mode control system;motion equations;system state space;canonical space;digital control;discretization chatter;infinite switching frequency","","47","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When it is applied to medium and large capacity compensators, the voltage stress across each switch is so high that the corresponding dv/dt causes large electromagnetic interference. The multilevel voltage source inverter topologies are good substitutes, since they can reduce voltage stress and improves output harmonic contents. The existing three-level neutral point clamped (NPC) inverter in three-phase three-wire systems can be used in three-phase four-wire systems also, because the split dc capacitors provide a neutral connection. This paper presents a comparison study between the three-level four-leg NPC inverter and the three-level NPC inverter. A fast and generalized applicable three-dimensional space vector modulation (3DSVM) is proposed for controlling a three-level NPC inverter in a three-phase four-wire system. The zero-sequence component of each vector is considered in order to implement the neutral current compensation. Both simulation and experimental results are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed 3DSVM control strategy.

This paper presents the design, analysis, and implementation of a simple neutral-point voltage regulator for a three-level diode-clamped multilevel inverter, which uses a multiple-carrier sine-triangle modulator in conjunction with a closed-loop controller for neutral-point regulation. Redundant state choices are controlled via a continuous offset voltage that regulates the dc injection into the midpoint of the dc bus. A small-signal transfer function is developed in closed form, for neutral-point regulation, with the voltage offset as the control variable. Besides maintaining dc-bus voltage balance, the use of the approach leads to a significant reduction in the voltage distortion at the neutral point, allowing a definitive reduction in the required dc bus capacitance.

These characteristics are derived by analyzing the phishing data archive provided by the anti-phishing working group (APWG). Because it is based on the generic characteristics of phishing attacks, LinkGuard can detect not only known but also unknown phishing attacks. We have implemented LinkGuard in Windows XP. Our experiments verified that LinkGuard is effective to detect and prevent both known and unknown phishing attacks with minimal false negatives.

Banking institutions, the insurance and medical professions, goods and commodity exchanges, the airline industry, and local, state, and federal government agencies have all sought increased computer security and confidence in their computer communications. * Computer security techniques, defense methodologies, and security appliances are discussed and analyzed. These discussions will center on various computer and network security devices. With these devices, the foundations for a rigorous security policy can be created. Security policies are important in preventing compromises of network security and threats affecting secure computer communications. Vulnerabilities in computer networks are identified in terms of exploits. The deployment of scanning technologies can discover these exploits and their affects on the integrity of the information exchanged. These same technologies can assign risk factors and pose suggestions for corrective actions in the computer environment. A firewall system installation is deployed on the network of the enterprise to protect and secure a computer communications architecture. Intrusion detection techniques include signature identification of the intruder to locate and respond to network and host-based intruder attacks. Some of these same techniques will uncover the forensic evidence and explain how the computer or network system was compromised.

Network security perimeter devices such as firewalls, IPSec, and IDS/IPS devices operate based on locally configured policies. However, configuring network security policies remains a complex and error-prone task due to rule dependency semantics and the interaction between policies in the network. This complexity is likely to increase as the network size increases. A successful deployment of a network security system requires global analysis of policy configurations of all network security devices in order to avoid policy conflicts and inconsistency. Policy conflicts may cause serious security breaches and network vulnerability such as blocking legitimate traffic, permitting unwanted traffic, and insecure data transmission. This article presents a comprehensive classification of security policy conflicts that might potentially exist in a single security device (intrapolicy conflicts) or between different network devices (interpolicy conflicts) in enterprise networks.

Windpower presently is the fastest growing power generation sector in the world. However, windpower is intermittent. To be able to trade efficiently, make the best use of transmission line capability, and address concerns with system frequency in a re-regulated system, accurate very short-term forecasts are essential. The research introduces a novel approach-the application of an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system to forecasting a wind time series. Over the very short-term forecast interval, both windspeed and wind direction are important parameters. To be able to be gain the most from a forecast on this time scale, the turbines must be directed toward on oncoming wind. For this reason, this paper forecasts wind vectors, rather than windspeed or power output.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2006.873421","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1626404","Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS);intelligent systems;very short-term forecasting;windpower","Wind forecasting;Wind energy generation;Wind power generation;Power generation;Australia;Production;Oceans;Hydroelectric power generation;Power transmission lines;Frequency","load forecasting;wind power plants;power transmission;time series;fuzzy neural nets;power engineering computing","short-term wind forecasting;Tasmanian power generation;wind power;transmission line capability;adaptive neurofuzzy inference system;wind time series","","214","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method is based on injecting a disturbance signal into the system through either the direct axis (d-axis) or the quadrature axis (q-axis) current controllers of the interface voltage-sourced converter. Signal injection through the d-axis controller modulates the amplitude of the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC), whereas signal injection through the q-axis controller causes a frequency deviation at PCC, under islanded conditions. Monitoring strategies to detect islanding are also presented for the proposed injection method. The feasibility of the proposed method is evaluated under the UL1741 anti-islanding test configuration. The studies reported in this paper are based on time-domain simulations in the PSCAD/EMTDC environment. The studies show that the proposed islanding detection method succeeds in detecting the islanding phenomenon as fast as 33.3 ms for the parameter setting of the test system, and always meets the two-second UL detection requirement.

Such voltage ratings are attractive for pulsed power and high-voltage switch-mode converter applications. However, as the IGBT voltage ratings increase, the rate of current rise and fall are generally reduced. This tradeoff is difficult to avoid as IGBTs must maintain a low resistance in the epitaxial or drift region layer. For high-voltage-rated IGBTs with thick drift regions to support the reverse voltage, the required high carrier concentrations are injected at turn on and removed at turn off, which slows the switching speed. An option for faster switching is to series multiple, lower voltage-rated IGBTs. An IGBT-stack prototype with six, 1200 V rated IGBTs in series has been experimentally tested. The six-series IGBT stack consists of individual, optically isolated, gate drivers and aluminum cooling plates for forced air cooling which results in a compact package. Each IGBT is overvoltage protected by transient voltage suppressors. The turn-on current rise time of the six-series IGBT stack and a single 6.5 kV rated IGBT has been experimentally measured in a pulsed resistive-load, capacitor discharge circuit. The IGBT stack has also been compared to two IGBT modules in series, each rated at 3.3 kV, in a boost circuit application switching at 9 kHz and producing an output of 5 kV. The six-series IGBT stack results in improved turn-on switching speed, and significantly higher power boost converter efficiency due to a reduced current tail during turn off.

We analytically derive the time domain SC-FDMA signals and numerically compare PAPR characteristics using the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of PAPR. The results show that SC-FDMA signals indeed have lower PAPR compared to those of OFDMA.

For high efficiency, class J/E operation was employed, which can attain up to 80% efficiency over a wide range of input powers and power supply voltages. For nonconstant envelope input, the average efficiency is further increased by employing the envelope-tracking architecture using a wide-bandwidth high-efficiency envelope amplifier. The linearity of overall system is enhanced by digital pre-distortion.

Best practice is to use super-capacitors with batteries, reducing the deep charge-discharge cycle and battery size. According to the energy requirements of the EV bus, the control strategies of the energy management system about the dynamic battery and super-capacitor EV bus are studied. With batteries and super-capacitors electric vehicle as the main research subjects, which runs between system and parts time after time, different parts of the dynamic model was built, which include road-load model, super-capacitors model, direct current link model, power transform model and system circuit model etc. The electric vehicle simulation model with the control system of the multi-energy dynamic assembly is built, and simulated, in the ECE 15 which is an urban driving cycle and EDUC (extra urban driving cycle). Simulation results show that the dynamic performance is increased with super-capacitors in the same condition. Based on simulation, average energy consumptions with super-capacitors and without super-capacitors are calculated in typical urban driving and suburb driving cycles respectively. Calculations show that whilst average energy consumption with super-capacitors in urban driving cycle is reduced, this is not so in the suburb driving cycle. The developing low floorboard EV bus (BK6121EV) with multi-energy dynamic assembly system was used to experiment on the test road surface of Tong county in Beijing city, under the different states of the super-capacitors controller on-off. The trend of tested data curve is consistent with the simulation.

In the human face detection applications, face(s) most frequently form an inconsequential part of the images. Consequently, preliminary segmentation of images into regions that contain ""non-face"" objects and regions that may contain ""face"" candidates can greatly accelerate the process of human face detection. Most existing face detection approaches have assumptions, which make them applicable only under some specific conditions. Existing techniques for face detection in colour images are plagued by poor performance in the presence of scale variation, variation in illumination, variation in skin colours, complex backgrounds etc. In this research work we have made a humble attempt to propose an algorithm for face detection in colour images in the presence of varying lighting conditions, for varied skin colours as well as with complex backgrounds. Based on a novel tangible skin component extraction modus operandi and detection of the valid face candidates, our method detects skin regions over the entire image and engenders face candidates based on the signatures of the detected skin patches. The algorithm constructs the boundary for each face candidate. Experimental results demonstrate successful face detection over a wide range of facial variations in colour, position, scale, varying lighting conditions, orientation, 3D pose, and expression in images from the database which is enriched with several photo collections (both indoors and outdoors with all the above mentioned extreme cases taken into consideration). In view of the capability to handle high degree of variability, that our approach can handle we articulate that our approach outperforms all the published popular methods","1553-572X","978-1-5090-9155-3","10.1109/IECON.2006.348133","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4153394","Face detection;Face recognition;Lighting compensation;Colour transformation;Skin tone;Facial map;Signatures","Skin;Lighting;Face detection;Humans;Application software;Image databases;Computer interfaces;Face recognition;Video surveillance;Image segmentation","face recognition;image colour analysis;image segmentation;lighting;video surveillance;visual databases","skin illumination compensation model;human computer interface;face recognition video surveillance;face image database management;human face detection applications;image segmentation;colour images","","15","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The tail current is made large when the oscillator output voltage reaches its maximum or minimum value and when the sensitivity of the output phase to injected noise is the smallest; the tail current is made small during the zero crossings of the output voltage when the phase noise sensitivity is large. The phase noise contributions of the active devices are decreased and the VCO has a larger oscillation amplitude and thus better DC to RF conversion compared to a standard VCO with equal power dissipation. A circuit design to implement tail current-shaping is presented that does not dissipate any extra power, does not use additional (noisy) active devices and occupies a small area.

However, PCA is not very effective for the extraction of the most discriminant features, and LDA is not stable due to the small sample size problem . In this paper, we propose some new (linear and nonlinear) feature extractors based on maximum margin criterion (MMC). Geometrically, feature extractors based on MMC maximize the (average) margin between classes after dimensionality reduction. It is shown that MMC can represent class separability better than PCA. As a connection to LDA, we may also derive LDA from MMC by incorporating some constraints. By using some other constraints, we establish a new linear feature extractor that does not suffer from the small sample size problem, which is known to cause serious stability problems for LDA. The kernelized (nonlinear) counterpart of this linear feature extractor is also established in the paper.

The Fourier transformation and the finite-element method considering the carrier harmonics are applied to this calculation. The calculated iron loss is compared with the measurement at each driving condition. The measured and the calculated results agree well.

Two of the major benefits of the LLC resonant topology are the ability of the power MOSFETs and secondary rectifiers to be soft-switched and the capability of operating down to zero load.

Compared with the traditional full-bridge converter, the input current ripple and output filter can be reduced. In addition, all the switches can realize zero-voltage switching from nearly zero to full load, and the switches of the TL leg sustain only half of the input voltage. Moreover, the rectifier diodes can achieve zero-current switching, and the voltage stress across them can be minimized to the output voltage.

Traditionally the Hough transform, (a special case of the Radon transform) has been widely used to solve this problem for binary images. In this paper, we pose the problem of detecting straight lines in gray-scale images as an inverse problem. Our formulation is based on use of the inverse Radon operator, which relates the parameters determining the location and orientation of the lines in the image to the noisy input image. The advantage of this formulation is that we can then approach the problem of line detection within a regularization framework and enhance the performance of the Hough-based line detector through the incorporation of prior information in the form of regularization. We discuss the type of regularizers that are useful for this problem and derive efficient computational schemes to solve the resulting optimization problems enabling their use in large applications. Finally, we show how our new approach can be alternatively viewed as one of finding an optimal representation of the noisy image in terms of elements chosen from a dictionary of lines. This interpretation relates the problem of Hough-based line finding to the body of work on adaptive signal representation.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2005.863021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1593662","Basis pursuit;Hough transform;inverse problems;line detection;Radon transform;regularization;tomography","Detectors;Sensor arrays;Shape;Computer vision;Image processing;Inverse problems;Object recognition;Image edge detection;Application software;Voting","Hough transforms;Radon transforms;image representation","line image detection;regularized Hough transform;computer vision processing;Radon transform;gray-scale images;image representation","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","124","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The control scheme consists of a synchronous frame decoupling current controller, MTPA torque controller, and adaptive parameter estimator. The estimator is applied to the q-axis current dynamics as the d-axis inductance can be assumed to be constant without loss of accuracy. Since the q-axis current dynamics is being disturbed by the magnet's back-EMF voltage, the proposed estimator is combined with a robust active-state decoupling scheme to ensure unbiased parameter estimate. The robust decoupling scheme is realized by estimating the magnet's flux linkage by a simple adaptation algorithm based on the steepest descent method. The system's model is greatly simplified when the robust decoupling scheme is combined with the q-axis current dynamics. Relying on the simplified model, a natural adaptive observer is used to estimate the q-axis current. Unknown motor parameters are estimated by minimizing the state estimation error using an iterative gradient algorithm offered by the affine projection. The estimated parameters are used for the self-tuning control.

"Enabling RFID in retail","G. Roussos","Birkbeck Coll., London Univ., UK","Computer","","2006","39","3","25","30","The past two years have witnessed an explosion of interest in radio-frequency identification and supporting technologies, due primarily to their rapidly expanding use in tracking grocery products through the supply chain. Currently such applications monitor store-keeping units (SKUs) rather than individual goods, as the relatively high cost of RFID deployment and the very low profit margin of supermarket products make item-level tagging impractical. Yet, economic and technical concerns aside, it is easy to envision a supermarket in which each item is tagged with an RFID label and all shopping carts feature RFID readers. The carts could potentially include onboard computers that recognize products placed inside and that display information and promotions retrieved wirelessly from the system back end. RFID-enabled smart phones, which are commercially available today and becoming increasingly popular, could carry out the same function. Item-level deployment of RFID technology would also allow for quick checkout aisles that scan all products at once and thus eliminate queues, which are consistently reported as one of the most negative aspects of supermarket shopping. A simple extension of this system would be to embed RFID devices in consumers' loyalty or frequent-shopper cards to identify individuals. This could expedite system login and charge the shopping cost directly to the customer's account at the point of sale-unless removed at the POS, item-level tags will inevitably follow the consumer home. This scenario undoubtedly raises numerous privacy concerns.","1558-0814","","10.1109/MC.2006.88","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607945","RFID technology;Security and privacy","Radiofrequency identification;Costs;Computer displays;Explosions;Radio frequency;Supply chains;Monitoring;Tagging;RFID tags;Information retrieval","supply chain management;retail data processing;radiofrequency identification","supply chain;store-keeping units;RFID readers;RFID-enabled smart phones;supermarket shopping carts;RFID device embedding;onboard computers;grocery product tracking","","81","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In order to support such large payloads, the radio physical layer must employ receiver algorithms that provide a significant increase in spectrum efficiency (and, hence, capacity) over current wireless systems. Recently, an explosion of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) studies have appeared with many journals presenting special issues on this subject. This has occurred due to the potential of MIMO to provide a linear increase in capacity with antenna numbers. Environmental considerations and tower loads will often restrict the placing of large antenna spans on base stations (BSs). Similarly, customer device form factors also place a limit on the antenna numbers that can be placed with a mutual spacing of 0.5 wavelength. The use of cross-polarized antennas is widely used in modern cellular installations as it reduces spacing needs and tower loads on BSs. Hence, this approach is also receiving considerable attention in MIMO systems. In order to study and compare various receiver architectures that are based on MIMO techniques, one needs to have an accurate knowledge of the MIMO channel. However, very few studies have appeared that characterize the cross-polarized MIMO channel. Recently, the third-generation partnership standards bodies (3GPP/3GPP2) have defined a cross-polarized channel model for MIMO systems but this model neglects the elevation spectrum. In this paper, we provide a deeper understanding of the channel model for cross-polarized systems for different environments and propose a composite channel impulse model for the cross-polarized channel that takes into account both azimuth and elevation spectrum. We use the resulting channel impulse response to derive closed-form expressions for the spatial correlation. We also present models to describe the dependence of cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) on distance, azimuth and elevation and delay spread. In addition, we study the impact of array width, signal-to-noise ratio, and antenna slant angle on the mutual information (MI) of the system. In particular, we present an analytical model for large system mean mutual information values and consider the impact of elevation spectrum on MI. Finally, the impact of multipath delays on XPD and MI is also explored.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2005.862398","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1603707","Capacity;cross-polarized channels;multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO)","Polarization;MIMO;Mutual information;Poles and towers;Loaded antennas;Azimuth;Delay;Payloads;Physical layer;Receivers","4G mobile communication;3G mobile communication;cellular radio;indoor radio;radio receivers;MIMO systems;transient response;electromagnetic wave polarisation;correlation methods;multipath channels;delays;antenna arrays","fourth-generation system;outdoor environment;indoor-stationary environment;radio physical layer;receiver algorithm;spectrum efficiency;multiple-input-multiple-output;MIMO channel;tower load;base station;customer device;cross-polarized antenna;cellular installation;third-generation partnership standards body;3GPP2;azimuth spectrum;impulse response;closed-form expression;spatial correlation;cross-polarization discrimination;XPD;system mutual information;elevation spectrum;multipath delay;100 Mbit/s;1 Gbit/s","","167","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using the controller passivity concept, the Lyapunov-Krasovskii technique, and Parseval's identity, we can passify the combination of the delayed communication and control blocks altogether robustly, as long as the delays are finite constants and an upper bound for the round-trip delay is known. Having explicit position feedback through the delayed P-action, the proposed framework enforces master-slave position coordination, which is often compromised in the conventional scattering-based teleoperation.

We identify three negative side-effects of reordering introduced by CMT that must be managed before efficient parallel transfer can be achieved: (1) unnecessary fast retransmissions by a sender; (2) overly conservative congestion window (cwnd) growth at a sender; and (3) increased ack traffic due to fewer delayed acks by a receiver. We propose three algorithms which augment and/or modify current SCTP to counter these side-effects. Presented with several choices as to where a sender should direct retransmissions of lost data, we propose five retransmission policies for CMT. We demonstrate spurious retransmissions in CMT with all five policies and propose changes to CMT to allow the different policies. CMT is evaluated against AppStripe, which is an idealized application that stripes data over multiple paths using multiple SCTP associations. The different CMT retransmission policies are then evaluated with varied constrained receive buffer sizes.

Two exoskeleton architectures are pursued based on examining human walking data.

In order to have high-power density, the converter can be designed to operate in discontinuous conducting mode (DCM) such that the passive inductor can be minimized. The DCM associated current ripple can be alleviated by multiphase interleaved operation. However DCM operation tends to increase turn-off loss because of a high peak current and its associated parasitic ringing due to the oscillation between the inductor and the device output capacitance. Thus the efficiency is suffered with the conventional DCM operation. Although to reduce the turn-off loss, a lossless capacitor snubber can be added across the switch, the energy stored in the capacitor needs to be discharged before device is turned on in order to realize zero-voltage switching. This paper adopts a gate signal complimentary control scheme to turn on the non-active switch and divert the current into the anti-paralleled diode of the active switch so that the main switch can turn on under zero-voltage condition. Thus both soft switching turn-on and turn-off are achieved. This diverted current also eliminates the parasitic ringing in inductor current. For capacitor value selection, there is a trade-off between turn-on and turn-off losses. This paper suggests the optimization of capacitance selection through a series of hardware experiments to ensure the overall power loss minimization under complimentary DCM operating condition. A 100kW hardware prototype is constructed and tested. The experimental results are provided to verify the proposed design approach.","2377-6617","0-7803-9716-9","10.1109/pesc.2006.1712087","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1712087","Bidirectional dc-dc converter;synchronous operating mode;high power density;high power dc-dc converter","Inductors;Switches;Capacitors;Inductance;Capacitance;Snubbers;Logic gates","","","","2","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We demonstrate that with a few augmentations, existing 2D SLAM technology can be extended to perform full 3D SLAM in less benign, outdoor, undulating environments. In particular, we use data acquired with a 3D laser range finder. We use a simple segmentation algorithm to separate the data stream into distinct point clouds, each referenced to a vehicle position. The SLAM technique we then adopt inherits much from 2D delayed state (or scan-matching) SLAM in that the state vector is an ever growing stack of past vehicle positions and inter-scan registrations are used to form measurements between them. The registration algorithm used is a novel combination of previous techniques carefully balancing the need for maximally wide convergence basins, robustness and speed.

"A Convolutional Neural Network Approach for Objective Video Quality Assessment","P. Le Callet; C. Viard-Gaudin; D. Barba","Inst. de Recherche en Commun. et Cybernetique de Nantes, Nantes Univ.; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","","2006","17","5","1316","1327","This paper describes an application of neural networks in the field of objective measurement method designed to automatically assess the perceived quality of digital videos. This challenging issue aims to emulate human judgment and to replace very complex and time consuming subjective quality assessment. Several metrics have been proposed in literature to tackle this issue. They are based on a general framework that combines different stages, each of them addressing complex problems. The ambition of this paper is not to present a global perfect quality metric but rather to focus on an original way to use neural networks in such a framework in the context of reduced reference (RR) quality metric. Especially, we point out the interest of such a tool for combining features and pooling them in order to compute quality scores. The proposed approach solves some problems inherent to objective metrics that should predict subjective quality score obtained using the single stimulus continuous quality evaluation (SSCQE) method. This latter has been adopted by video quality expert group (VQEG) in its recently finalized reduced referenced and no reference (RRNR-TV) test plan. The originality of such approach compared to previous attempts to use neural networks for quality assessment, relies on the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) that allows a continuous time scoring of the video. Objective features are extracted on a frame-by-frame basis on both the reference and the distorted sequences; they are derived from a perceptual-based representation and integrated along the temporal axis using a time-delay neural network (TDNN). Experiments conducted on different MPEG-2 videos, with bit rates ranging 2-6 Mb/s, show the effectiveness of the proposed approach to get a plausible model of temporal pooling from the human vision system (HVS) point of view. More specifically, a linear correlation criteria, between objective and subjective scoring, up to 0.92 has been obtained on a set of typical TV videos","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2006.879766","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1687939","Convolutional neural network (CNN);MPEG-2;temporal pooling;video quality assessment","Neural networks;Quality assessment;Humans;Design methodology;Testing;Cellular neural networks;Feature extraction;Bit rate;Machine vision;TV","convolution;delay systems;neural nets;video signal processing","convolutional neural network;objective video quality assessment;digital videos;reduced reference quality metric;single stimulus continuous quality evaluation method;video quality expert group;time-delay neural network","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Neural Networks (Computer);Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photography;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Video Recording","101","","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Selenium is an open-source project for in-browser testing, originally developed by ThoughtWorks and now boasting an active community of developers and users. One of Selenium's stated goals is to become the de facto open-source replacement for proprietary tools such as WinRunner. Of particular interest to the agile community is that it offers the possibility of test-first design of Web applications, red-green signals for customer acceptance tests, and an automated regression test bed for the Web tier. This experience report describes the standard environment for testing with Selenium, as well as modifications we performed to incorporate our script pages into a wiki. It includes lessons we learned about continuous integration, script writing, and using the Selenium Recorder (renamed IDE). We also discuss how long it took to write and maintain the scripts in the iterative development environment, how close we came to covering all of the functional requirements with tests, how often the tests should be (and were) run, and whether additional automated functional testing below the GUI layer was still necessary and/or appropriate. While no silver bullet, Selenium has become a valuable addition to our agile testing toolkit, and is used on the majority of our Web application projects. It promises to become even more valuable as it gains widespread adoption and continues to be actively developed","","0-7695-2562-8","10.1109/AGILE.2006.19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1667589","","Automatic testing;Open source software;Silver;Writing;Application software;Java;Software testing;Signal design;Performance evaluation;Graphical user interfaces","Internet;program testing;program verification;project management;public domain software;software development management","functional test automation;Selenium open-source project;in-browser testing;open-source replacement;proprietary tools;WinRunner;agile community;test-first design;customer acceptance tests;automated regression test;Web tier;script pages;continuous integration;script writing;Selenium Recorder;iterative development environment;functional requirements;GUI layer;agile testing toolkit;Web application projects","","43","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The estimator is based on the envelope of the unmodulated received signal and an expression between the Rician channel statistics and K factor is presented. We depict its functionality for fixed and low mobility systems, with different carrier frequencies, thus making the estimator candidate for use not only for specific systems such as mobile communications.

Person reidentification approaches have two aspects: (i) establish correspondence between parts, and (ii) generate signatures that are invariant to variations in illumination, pose, and the dynamic appearance of clothing. A novel spatiotemporal segmentation algorithm is employed to generate salient edgels that are robust to changes in appearance of clothing. The invariant signatures are generated by combining normalized color and salient edgel histograms. Two approaches are proposed to generate correspondences: (i) a model based approach that fits an articulated model to each individual to establish a correspondence map, and (ii) an interest point operator approach that nominates a large number of potential correspondences which are evaluated using a region growing scheme.

In a patient study, following a standard /sup 18/F-FDG PET/CT scan, a super-resolution scan around one small lesion was performed using axial shifts without increasing the patient radiation exposure. In the phantom study, smaller features (3 mm) could be resolved axially with the super-resolution method than without (6 mm). The super-resolution images had better resolution than the original images and provided higher contrast ratios in coronal images and in 3-D acquisition transaxial images. The coronal super-resolution images had superior resolution and contrast ratios compared to images reconstructed by merely interleaving the data to the proper axial location. In the patient study, super-resolution reconstructions displayed a more localized /sup 18/F-FDG uptake.

The only assumption is that the image projection function can be described by a Taylor series expansion whose coefficients are estimated by solving a two-step least-squares linear minimization problem. To test the proposed technique, we calibrated a panoramic camera having a field of view greater than 200 in the vertical direction, and we obtained very good results. To investigate the accuracy of the calibration, we also used the estimated omni-camera model in a structure from motion experiment. We obtained a 3D metric reconstruction of a scene from two highly distorted omnidirectional images by using image correspondences only. Compared with classical techniques, which rely on a specific parametric model of the omnidirectional camera, the proposed procedure is independent of the sensor, easy to use, and flexible.","","0-7695-2506-7","10.1109/ICVS.2006.3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1578733","","Cameras;Calibration;Robot vision systems;Layout;Mirrors;Lenses;Motion estimation;Machine vision;Computer vision;Cognitive robotics","","","","174","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional DVS techniques require significant voltage safety margins to guarantee computational correctness at the worst case combination of process, voltage and temperature conditions, leading to a loss in energy efficiency. In Razor-based DVS, however, the supply voltage is automatically reduced to the point of first failure using the error detection and correction mechanism, thereby eliminating safety margins while still ensuring correct operation. In addition, the supply voltage can be intentionally scaled below the point of first failure of the processor to achieve an optimal tradeoff between energy savings from further voltage reduction and energy overhead from increased error detection and correction activity. We tested and measured savings due to Razor DVS for 33 different dies and obtained an average energy savings of 50% over worst case operating conditions by scaling supply voltage to achieve a 0.1% targeted error rate, at a fixed frequency of 120 MHz.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2006.870912","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1610623","Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS);error detection and correction;self-tuning processor;voltage safety margins","Voltage control;Delay;Error correction;Safety;Dynamic voltage scaling;Timing;Silicon;Temperature;Energy efficiency;Testing","microprocessor chips;error detection;error correction;voltage control;integrated circuit design;elemental semiconductors;silicon","self-tuning processor;DVS processor;delay-error detection;delay-error correction;dynamic voltage scaling;error detection mechanism;error correction mechanism;silicon measurements;supply voltage control;DVS techniques;120 MHz;0.18 micron;64 bit;Si","","261","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This generalization gives a lower bound on the fraction of output nodes of degree 2 of a Raptor code if the error probability of the belief-propagation decoder converges to zero. Using information-theoretic arguments, we will show that if a sequence of output degree distributions is to achieve the capacity of the underlying channel, then the fraction of nodes of degree 2 in these degree distributions has to converge to a certain quantity depending on the channel. For the class of erasure channels this quantity is independent of the erasure probability of the channel, but for many other classes of BIMSCs, this fraction depends on the particular channel chosen. This result has implications on the ""universality"" of Raptor codes for classes other than the class of erasure channels, in a sense that will be made more precise in the paper.

These tags derive their power supply from the incoming RF energy through rectification instead of from a battery. The regulator is functional with just 110 nA current. Owing to the huge variation of the rectified voltage (by as much as tens of volts), voltage limiters and clamps are employed at various points along the regulation path. A limiter at the rectifier output clamps the rectifier voltage to a narrower range of 1.4 V. A fine-regulator, then, regulates the supply voltage close to a bandgap reference value of 1.25 V. The key aspect of this regulator is the dynamic bandwidth boosting that takes place in the regulator by sensing the excess current that is bypassed in the limter (during periods of excess energy) and increasing its bias current and hence bandwidth, accordingly. A higher bandwidth is necessary for quick recovery from line transients due to the burst nature of RF transmission, with a larger energy burst requiring a higher bandwidth to settle quickly without large line transients. The challenge of compensating such a regulator across various load currents and RF energy levels is described in this paper","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2006.881015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1683893","Frequency compensation;passive tags;power management;RFID;voltage regulator","Voltage;Regulators;Bandwidth;Boosting;Radiofrequency identification;Radio frequency;CMOS technology;Clamps;Rectifiers;Passive RFID tags","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;current limiters;radiofrequency identification;rectification;rectifying circuits;voltage regulators","voltage regulator system;dynamic bandwidth boosting;RFID systems;ultra-low-power RFID tags;passive tags;analog CMOS technology;voltage limiters;bandgap reference value;RF transmission;110 nA;0.15 micron;1.4 V","","76","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the difficulties for the development and quality assessment of such models has been the lack of gold standard data for their validation. Thus, while data on plasma concentrations of glucose are available, the rates of appearance in plasma of ingested glucose (Ra) were not available to develop such models. Here we utilize the recent availability of Ra data, estimated with a model-independent multiple tracer technique, to formulate a system model of intestinal glucose absorption. Two published and two new models are tested on this new data set. One of the two new models performed best: it is nonlinear, describes the Ra data well and its parameters are estimated with good precision.

The negative effective permeability is provided by the VLSRRs in a narrow band above their resonant frequency, which can be bias controlled by virtue of the presence of diode varactors. To achieve a negative effective permittivity in the left-handed structure, metallic vias emulating shunt inductances are periodically placed between the conductor strip and the ground plane. The lumped-element equivalent-circuit models of the designed structures have been derived. It has been found that these models provide a good qualitative description of device performance.

Such distance data may be acquired by a sensor node by communicating with its neighbors. We describe a general semidefinite programming (SDP)-based approach for solving the graph realization problem, of which the sensor network localization problems is a special case. We investigate the performance of this method on problems with noisy distance data. Error bounds are derived from the SDP formulation. The sources of estimation error in the SDP formulation are identified. The SDP solution usually has a rank higher than the underlying physical space which, when projected onto the lower dimensional space, generally results in high estimation error. We describe two improvements to ameliorate such a difficulty. First, we propose a regularization term in the objective function that can help to reduce the rank of the SDP solution. Second, we use the points estimated from the SDP solution as the initial iterate for a gradient-descent method to further refine the estimated points. A lower bound obtained from the optimal SDP objective value can be used to check the solution quality. Experimental results are presented to validate our methods and show that they outperform existing SDP methods. Note to Practitioners-Wireless sensor networks consist of a large number of inexpensive wireless sensors deployed in a geographical area with the ability to communicate with their neighbors within a limited radio range. Wireless sensor networks are finding increasing applicability to a range of monitoring applications in civil and military scenarios, such as biodiversity and geographical monitoring, smart homes, industrial control, surveillance, and traffic monitoring. It is often very useful in the applications of sensor networks to know the locations of the sensors. Global positioning systems suffer from many drawbacks in this scenario, such as high cost, line-of-sight issues, etc. Therefore, there is a need to develop robust and efficient algorithms that can estimate or ""localize"" sensor positions in a network by using only the mutual distance measures (received signal strength, time of arrival) that the wireless sensors receive from their neighbors. This paper describes an algorithm that solves the sensor network localization problem using advanced optimization techniques. We also study the effect of using very noisy measurements and propose robust methods to deal with high noise. Finally, simulation results for the algorithms are presented to demonstrate their performance in terms of computational effort and accuracy","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2006.877401","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1707954","Dimensionality reduction;graph realization;position estimation;semidefinite programming","Distance measurement;Wireless sensor networks;Biosensors;Intelligent sensors;Monitoring;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Estimation error;Biodiversity;Smart homes;Industrial control","civil engineering;distance measurement;error analysis;Global Positioning System;gradient methods;graph theory;industrial control;measurement errors;military systems;wireless sensor networks","sensor network localization problem;pairwise noisy distance measurements;semidefinite programming approach;graph realization problem;estimation error;gradient-descent method;wireless sensor networks;monitoring process;civil engineering;military systems;biodiversity;geographical monitoring;smart homes;industrial control;surveillance;traffic monitoring;Global Positioning Systems;mutual distance measures;dimensionality reduction;position estimation","","261","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A comparative investigation is performed into the use of different random modulation schemes (driven by the DSP-2 board with the TMS320C32) as against the normal PWM. The effectiveness of randomization on spreading those dominating frequencies that normally exist in constant frequency PWM schemes is evaluated by power spectral density (PSD) estimations in the low-frequency range. Some parasitical- and topology-based EMI sources in devices are presented and frequency analysis is shown by using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). SPICE simulations are also used to verify practical solutions for eliminating negative EMI sources and achieving EMC improvements. Finally, levels of conductive EMI are estimated with DFT, and experimentally verified to comply with the CISPR 25 (or EN 55025) regulations. Moreover, it is clearly shown, that limited speed PWM driving of the power switches with appropriate snubber circuits guarantees reduced conductive EMI.

The overall-bandwidth diminishing filter/functional block for extracting positive and negative sequence components has been avoided by employing dual current regulators in positive- and negative-rotating synchronous frames. The steady-state error due to 120-Hz ac signals has been reduced by employing a resonant-gain path in the current regulator. This paper also proposes simplified current-reference calculation scheme in the regulation of instantaneous active/reactive power. Compared to the previous works, the proposed control method has better transient response in compensation for generalized unbalanced operating conditions (unbalanced input supply and unbalanced input impedances) of wide range while still satisfying unity input power-factor correction and ripple-free dc-output-voltage regulation without adding any external hardware. The proposed control system has been analyzed and tuned based on the ac small signal perturbed model under unbalance. Simulation and experimental results confirm the proposed control method under severe unbalanced operating conditions.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2006.873673","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1634688","AC/DC converter;hybrid synchronous-frame controller;unbalance","Pulse width modulation;Pulse width modulation converters;DC-DC power converters;Transient response;Regulators;Filters;Steady-state;Resonance;Reactive power;Impedance","PWM power convertors;AC-DC power convertors;transient response;electric current control;voltage regulators;reactive power control","hybrid synchronous stationary frame;PWM AC-DC converter;transient response;pulsewidth modulation AC-DC converter;positive-rotating synchronous frame;negative-rotating synchronous frame;resonant-gain path;current regulator;current-reference calculation;instantaneous active-reactive power;power factor correction;dc output voltage regulation;ac small signal perturbed model;120 Hz","","181","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the nature of the underlying graph algorithm, this approach has the ability to also recognize patterns that are modified from their standard representation. Moreover, the approach exploits the fact that patterns reside in one or more inheritance hierarchies, reducing the size of the graphs to which the algorithm is applied.

The core of the technique is a new likelihood ratio test that combines matched-filter responses, confidence measures and vessel boundary measures. Matched filter responses are derived in scale-space to extract vessels of widely varying widths. A vessel confidence measure is defined as a projection of a vector formed from a normalized pixel neighborhood onto a normalized ideal vessel profile. Vessel boundary measures and associated confidences are computed at potential vessel boundaries. Combined, these responses form a six-dimensional measurement vector at each pixel. A training technique is used to develop a mapping of this vector to a likelihood ratio that measures the ""vesselness"" at each pixel. Results comparing this vesselness measure to matched filters alone and to measures based on the Hessian of intensities show substantial improvements, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The Hessian can be used in place of the matched filter to obtain similar but less-substantial improvements or to steer the matched filter by preselecting kernel orientations. Finally, the new vesselness likelihood ratio is embedded into a vessel tracing framework, resulting in an efficient and effective vessel centerline extraction algorithm","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2006.884190","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4016172","Likelihood ratio;matched filters;retina images;vessel extraction;vessel tracing","Retinal vessels;Matched filters;Image edge detection;Retina;Image sequence analysis;Computer science;Pathology;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical filters;Optical sensors","blood vessels;eye;feature extraction;Hessian matrices;matched filters;medical image processing","retinal vessel centerline extraction;multiscale matched filters;confidence measure;edge measure;false detections;likelihood ratio test;matched-filter response;vessel boundary measures;normalized pixel neighborhood;training technique;Hessian matrix","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Fluorescein Angiography;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Retinal Vessels;Retinoscopy;Sensitivity and Specificity","217","","72","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The differential evolution (DE) algorithm is an evolutionary algorithm that uses a rather greedy and less stochastic approach to problem solving than do classical evolutionary algorithms, such as genetic algorithms, evolutionary programming, and evolution strategies. DE also incorporates an efficient way of self-adapting mutation using small populations. The potentialities of DE are its simple structure, easy use, convergence property, quality of solution, and robustness. This paper proposes a new approach for solving economic load dispatch problems with valve-point effect. The proposed method combines the DE algorithm with the generator of chaos sequences and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) technique to optimize the performance of economic dispatch problems. The DE with chaos sequences is the global optimizer, and the SQP is used to fine-tune the DE run in a sequential manner. The combined methodology and its variants are validated for two test systems consisting of 13 and 40 thermal units whose incremental fuel cost function takes into account the valve-point loading effects. The proposed combined method outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in solving load dispatch problems with the valve-point effect.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2006.873410","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1626407","Chaotic sequences;differential evolution (DE);economic dispatch;evolutionary algorithms;optimization;power generation;valve-point effect","Chaos;Quadratic programming;Power generation economics;Fuel economy;Evolutionary computation;Optimization methods;Power system economics;Power systems;Stochastic processes;Problem-solving","quadratic programming;load dispatching;evolutionary computation;greedy algorithms;stochastic processes;power system economics","chaotic differential evolution algorithm;sequential quadratic programming;economic load dispatch optimization;valve-point effects;evolutionary algorithms;heuristic methods;multimodal optimization problems;greedy approach;stochastic approach;self-adapting mutation","","343","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Consequently, the connection of such resources to the utility grid needs a dc/ac conversion stage. Voltage source converters (VSC) are widely used for this application as they have a mature technology. These converters are usually connected to the utility grid through a simple L filter to reduce the current harmonics injected to the grid. However, higher order filters, like LCL filters, can provide better harmonic attenuation and reduce the filter size at the same time. This paper is concerned with the subject of grid connected converters via LCL filter topology. The advantages of using LCL filter as compared to simple L filter are discussed. Mathematical expressions and plots are given to show the performance of these filters. The design criteria are stated.

It was inspired by the problem of maximizing a lower bound on the energy. However, the algorithm is not guaranteed to increase this bound - it may actually go down. In addition, TRW does not always converge. We develop a modification of this algorithm which we call sequential tree-reweighted message passing. Its main property is that the bound is guaranteed not to decrease. We also give a weak tree agreement condition which characterizes local maxima of the bound with respect to TRW algorithms. We prove that our algorithm has a limit point that achieves weak tree agreement. Finally, we show that, our algorithm requires half as much memory as traditional message passing approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that on certain synthetic and real problems, our algorithm outperforms both the ordinary belief propagation and tree-reweighted algorithm in (M. J.

In these situations, however, the information level of the signal is often far lower than the actual bandwidth, which prompts the question of whether more efficient schemes can be developed for measuring such signals.

Our ""analog-to-information converter"" (AIC) is inspired by the theory of compressive sensing (CS), which states that a discrete signal having a sparse representation in some dictionary can be recovered from a small number of linear projections of that signal. We generalize the CS theory to continuous-time sparse signals, explain our proposed AIC system in the CS context, and discuss practical issues regarding implementation","","1-4244-0669-2","10.1109/DCAS.2006.321036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4115115","","Demodulation;Radar signal processing;Radio frequency;Bandwidth;RF signals;Signal processing;Analog-digital conversion;Signal sampling;Digital modulation;Digital filters","analogue-digital conversion;demodulation;filtering theory;modulation;signal sampling","analog-to-information conversion;random demodulation;radiofrequency signals;RF signals;modulation;filtering;signal sampling;compressive sensing;discrete signal;continuous-time sparse signals","","215","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"A Bio-Inspired Ultra-Energy-Efficient Analog-to-Digital Converter for Biomedical Applications","H. Y. Yang; R.

Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for such applications only need modest precision (les 8 bits) and modest speed (les 40 kHz) but need to be very energy efficient. ADCs for implanted medical devices need micropower operation to run on a small battery for decades. We present a bio-inspired ADC that uses successive integrate-and-fire operations like spiking neurons to perform analog-to-digital conversion on its input current. In a 0.18-mum subthreshold CMOS implementation, we were able to achieve 8 bits of differential nonlinearlity limited precision and 7.4 bits of thermal-noise-limited precision at a 45-kHz sample rate with a total power consumption of 960 nW. This converter's net energy efficiency of 0.12 pJ/quantization level appears to be the best reported so far. The converter is also very area efficient (<0.021 mm2) and can be used in applications that need several converters in parallel. Its algorithm allows easy generalization to higher speed applications through interleaving, to performing polynomial analog computations on its input before digitization, and to direct time-to-digital conversion of event-based cardiac or neural signals","1558-0806","","10.1109/TCSI.2006.884463","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4012363","Analog–digital (A/D);bio-inspired;energy efficient;successive subranging;time based;time to digital","Analog-digital conversion;Energy efficiency;Electrocardiography;Electroencephalography;Temperature sensors;Blood pressure;Wireless sensor networks;Batteries;Neurons;Energy consumption","biomedical equipment;medical signal processing;quantisation (signal);signal processing equipment","bio-inspired analog-to-digital converter;ultra energy efficiency analog-to-digital converter;biomedical applications;implanted medical devices;micropower operation;bio-inspired ADC;integrate-and-fire operations;spiking neurons;differential nonlinearlity limited precision;thermal-noise-limited precision;quantization level;polynomial analog computations;time-to-digital conversion;event-based cardiac signals;neural signals;45 kHz;9 nW;18 micron;7.4 bit;8 bit","","42","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The converter practically eliminates both low- and high-frequency current ripple on the batteries, thus maximizing battery life without penalizing the volume of the converter. Moreover, soft switching of all switches is achieved using the proposed integrated auxiliary commutation circuit (iACC). Just one iACC is used to provide soft-switching conditions for the three converters that compose the system: the preregulator (boost), the battery charger (bidirectional converter operating as a buck), and the backup converter (bidirectional converter operating as a boost). This auxiliary circuit has few components and low reactive energy, increasing the system's overall efficiency.

The proposed algorithm denoises the image, while simultaneously trainining a dictionary on its (corrupted) content using the K-SVD algorithm. As the dictionary training algorithm is limited in handling small image patches, we extend its deployment to arbitrary image sizes by defining a global image prior that forces sparsity over patches in every location in the image.

However, LPP is nonorthogonal, and this makes it difficult to reconstruct the data. The orthogonal locality preserving projection (OLPP) method produces orthogonal basis functions and can have more locality preserving power than LPP.

The complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of the MI is also obtained using a Gaussian approximation. The CDF of MI can serve as an upper bound to the outage probability of nonergodic MIMO Rician channels.

This paper describes automatic methods for MA detection and shows how image contrast normalization can improve the ability to distinguish between MAs and other dots that occur on the retina. Various methods for contrast normalization are compared. Best results were obtained with a method that uses the watershed transform to derive a region that contains no vessels or other lesions.

Basic principle of wind turbine power converter is that the rectifier transforms the variable frequency and variable voltage electricity into DC power, then the multiple boost DC-DC converter arises the DC voltage level and keeps it nearly constant over whole wind speed to satisfy the following dual VSL According to modeling and simulation of power AC-DC-AC converter for MW wind turbine grid interface, with analysis of several important waveforms, it is verified that the power AC-DC-AC converter with its control strategy works well and can efficiently convert electricity generated by wind generator and transform it to grid successfully.","2377-6617","0-7803-9716-9","10.1109/pesc.2006.1711994","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1711994","","Wind turbines;Analytical models;Integrated circuit modeling;Inverters;Generators;Rectifiers;Transforms","","","","1","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nano- and micro-filler mixture composites were made by dispersing nano-scale layered silicate fillers and micro-scale silica fillers in epoxy resin. To investigate the effects of nano- and micro-filler mixture, the thermal expansion coefficient and insulation breakdown properties by a needle-plate electrode method were measured for the filler mixture composite and the conventional filled epoxy. The filler mixture composite had almost the same thermal expansion coefficient as the conventional filled epoxy. In a continuous voltage rising test, the filler mixture composite had 7% higher insulation breakdown strength than the conventional filled epoxy. Moreover, under constant AC voltage (10 kV at 1 kHz), the filler mixture composite had an insulation breakdown time of more than 20,000 minutes whereas the conventional filled epoxy had a breakdown time of 830 minutes. Electron microscope observation showed that the area surrounded by dispersed micro-scale silica fillers were also filled with the nano-scale layered silicate fillers. Furthermore, the estimate of spacing between the fillers and the filler/epoxy interface area showed a more densely-packed structure of the filler mixture composite than the conventional filled epoxy. The morphological feature of the filler mixture composite seems to improve its insulation breakdown strength and time.","1558-4135","","10.1109/TDEI.2006.1624276","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1624276","","Dielectrics and electrical insulation;Breakdown voltage;Silicon compounds;Thermal expansion;Electric breakdown;Composite materials;Nanocomposites;Nanostructured materials;Epoxy resins;Electrodes","epoxy insulation;composite insulating materials;filled polymers;thermal expansion;nanocomposites;electric breakdown;electrodes;electron microscopes","nanofiller mixture;microfiller mixture;electrical insulation property;epoxy composites;silica filler;thermal expansion coefficient;insulation breakdown;needle-plate electrode;electron microscope;dispersion;voltage rising test;morphological feature","","147","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper demonstrates that similar performance gains can be obtained in wireless relay networks employing terminals with MIMO capability. We consider a setup where a designated source terminal communicates with a designated destination terminal, both equipped with M antennas, assisted by K single-antenna or multiple-antenna relay terminals using a half-duplex protocol. Assuming perfect channel state information (CSI) at the destination and the relay terminals and no CSI at the source, we show that the corresponding network capacity scales as C = (M/2) log(K) + O(1) for fixed M, arbitrary (but fixed) number of (transmit and receive) antennas N at each of the relay terminals, and K rarr infin. We propose a protocol that assigns each relay terminal to one of the multiplexed data streams forwarded in a ""doubly coherent"" fashion (through matched filtering) to the destination terminal. It is shown that this protocol achieves the cut-set upper bound on network capacity for fixed M and K rarr infin (up to an O(1)-term) by employing independent stream decoding at the destination terminal. Our protocol performs inter-stream interference cancellation in a completely decentralized fashion, thereby orthogonalizing the effective MIMO channel between source and destination terminals. Finally, we discuss the case where the relay terminals do not have CSI and show that simple amplify-and-forward relaying, asymptotically in K, for fixed M and fixed N ges 1, turns the relay network into a point-to-point MIMO link with high-SNR capacity C = (M/2) log(SNR) + O(1), demonstrating that the use of relays as active scatterers can recover spatial multiplexing gain in poor scattering environments","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2006.1638664","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1638664","","MIMO;Relays;Protocols;Scattering;Telecommunication network reliability;Performance gain;Channel state information;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Matched filters","antenna arrays;interference suppression;matched filters;MIMO systems;multiplexing;protocols;radio links;radio networks;space-time codes;wireless channels","MIMO relay networks;capacity scaling laws;multiple antennas;wireless link;multiple-input multiple-output;link reliability;spatial multiplexing;space-time coding;spectral efficiency;single-antenna;multiple-antenna relay terminals;half-duplex protocol;channel state information;matched filtering;network capacity;stream decoding;inter-stream interference cancellation","","489","","47","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Experiments are performed on a large data set consisting of 4,000 pedestrian and more than 25,000 nonpedestrian (labeled) images captured in outdoor urban environments. Statistically meaningful results are obtained by analyzing performance variances caused by varying training and test sets. Furthermore, we investigate how classification performance and training sample size are correlated. Sample size is adjusted by increasing the number of manually labeled training data or by employing automatic bootstrapping or cascade techniques.

The realism of such interactions can be dramatically improved by superimposing event-based, high-frequency transient forces over traditional position-based feedback. When scaled by impact velocity, hand-tuned pulses and decaying sinusoids produce haptic cues that resemble those experienced during real impacts. Our new method for generating appropriate transients inverts a dynamic model of the haptic device to determine the motor forces required to create prerecorded acceleration profiles at the user's fingertips. After development, the event-based haptic paradigm and the method of acceleration matching were evaluated in a carefully controlled user study. Sixteen individuals blindly tapped on nine virtual and three real samples, rating the degree to which each felt like real wood. Event-based feedback achieved significantly higher realism ratings than the traditional rendering method. The display of transient signals made virtual objects feel similar to a real sample of wood on a foam substrate, while position feedback alone received ratings similar to those of foam.

This approach is based on the d-axis current regulator output voltage of the drive system that has the information of rotor position error. Rotor velocity can be estimated through a rotor-position-tracking proportional-integral (PI) controller that controls the position error to zero. For zero and low-speed operation, the PI controller gains of rotor position tracking controller have a variable structure according to the estimated rotor velocity. In order to boost the bandwidth of the PI controller around zero speed, a loop recovery technique is applied to the control system. The proposed method only requires the flux linkage of the permanent magnet and is insensitive to parameter estimation error and variation. The designers can easily determine the possible operating range with a desired bandwidth and perform vector control even at low speeds.

Higher capacity of the wind turbine necessitates operation of the corresponding electric machine and the static converter system at higher voltages. This paper presents a neutral point diode clamped (NPC) converter system that inherently accommodates higher voltage and power ratings of a high capacity wind power unit. The overall control strategy of an NPC-based wind power unit and the details of the ac side and the dc side controls of the NPC converter system are also described. The generator-side NPC converter provides torque-speed control of the turbine-generator unit. The network-side NPC converter controls real and reactive power flow to the network and thus regulates the dc bus voltage and the ac side power-factor (or voltage) respectively. The paper also presents a new control approach to balance the dc capacitor voltages. The NPC converter system is augmented with a dc chopper that controls the synchronous generator field current. The NPC-based converter system is used to interface a 3 MW, direct-drive (gearless), synchronous machine based wind power unit to the utility grid.

"Overview of IEC 61850 and Benefits","R. E. Mackiewicz","SISCO Inc., Sterling Heights, MI","2006 IEEE PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition","","2006","","","623","630","Legacy substation automation protocols and architectures typically provided basic functionality for power system automation and were designed to accommodate the technical limitations of the networking technology available for implementation. There has recently been a vast improvement in networking technology that has changed dramatically what is now feasible for power system automation in the substation. Technologies such as switched Ethernet, TCP/IP, high-speed wide area networks, and high-performance low-cost computers are providing capabilities that could barely be imagined when most legacy substation automation protocols were designed. In order to take advantage of modern technology to deliver additional new benefits to users of substation automation, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has developed and released a new global standard for substation automation: IEC 61850. The paper will provide a basic technical overview of IEC 61850 and will discuss the benefits of each major aspect of the standard. The concept of a virtual model comprising both physical and logical device models that includes a set of standardized communications services will be described along with explanations of how these standardized models, object naming conventions, and communication services bring significant benefits to the substation automation user. New services to support self-describing devices and object-orient peer-to-peer data exchange will be explained with an emphasis on how these services can be applied to reduce costs for substation automation. The substation configuration language (SCL) of IEC 61850 will be presented with information on how the standardization of substation configuration will impact the future of substation automation. The paper will conclude with a brief introduction to the UCA International Users Group as a forum where users and suppliers cooperate in improving substation automation with testing, education, and demonstrations of IEC 61850 and other IEC standards technology","","1-4244-0177-1","10.1109/PSCE.2006.296392","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4075831","","IEC standards;Substation automation;Protocols;Power systems;Design automation;Ethernet networks;TCPIP;Wide area networks;Computer networks;Standards development","electronic data interchange;IEC standards;peer-to-peer computing;power engineering computing;substation automation","IEC 61850 standard;legacy substation automation protocols;power system automation;networking technology;switched Ethernet;TCP/IP;high-speed wide area networks;International Electrotechnical Commission;IEC;virtual model;logical device models;communication services;object naming conventions;object-orient peer-to-peer data exchange;costs reduction;substation configuration language;International Users Group;UCA forum","","57","","2","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The distance field has been found to be a useful construction within the areas of computer vision, physics, and computer graphics. This paper serves as an exposition of methods for the production of distance fields, and a review of alternative representations and applications of distance fields.

The quadrotor has been presented into three interconnected subsystems. The first one representing the under-actuated subsystem, gives the dynamic relation of the horizontal positions with the pitch and roll angles. The second fully-actuated subsystem represents the dynamic behavior of the vertical position and the yaw angle. The last subsystem gives the dynamic of the four rotors propeller system.

Salient features are generally determined from the local differential structure of images. They focus on the shape-saliency of the local neighborhood. The majority of these detectors are luminance-based, which has the disadvantage that the distinctiveness of the local color information is completely ignored in determining salient image features. To fully exploit the possibilities of salient point detection in color images, color distinctiveness should be taken into account in addition to shape distinctiveness. In this paper, color distinctiveness is explicitly incorporated into the design of saliency detection. The algorithm, called color saliency boosting, is based on an analysis of the statistics of color image derivatives. Color saliency boosting is designed as a generic method easily adaptable to existing feature detectors. Results show that substantial improvements in information content are acquired by targeting color salient features.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2006.3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542040","Index Terms- Image saliency;feature detection;image statistics;color imaging.","Boosting;Computer vision;Detectors;Event detection;Shape;Image color analysis;Image analysis;Algorithm design and analysis;Statistical analysis;Statistics","feature extraction;image colour analysis;statistical analysis","image feature detection;local color information;salient point detection;color saliency boosting;statistical analysis;color image derivatives;color imaging","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Color;Colorimetry;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","183","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method uses a new point of view to understand the matrix converter modulation method such as the voltage source inverter (VSI) modulation method. Using the proposed method, this paper presents the two-phase/three-phase modulation method and dynamic/steady-state overmodulation method for the matrix converter. These methods are well developed in the study of a VSI. By the proposed steady-state overmodulation method, it is possible to synthesize the fundamental component of output voltage to be equal to that of input voltage at the cost of some distortion of input current. The feasibility of the proposed modulation method has been verified by a computer simulation and experimental results. These results show that the proposed carrier-based modulation method can be implemented easily without any tables.

The first challenging task of this approach is to estimate precisely the unknown mixing matrix. In this paper, an algorithm for estimating the mixing matrix that can be viewed as an extension of the DUET and the TIFROM methods is first developed. Standard clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means method) also can be used for estimating the mixing matrix if the sources are sufficiently sparse. Compared with the DUET, the TIFROM methods, and standard clustering algorithms, with the authors' proposed method, a broader class of problems can be solved, because the required key condition on sparsity of the sources can be considerably relaxed. The second task of the two-stage approach is to estimate the source matrix using a standard linear programming algorithm. Another main contribution of the work described in this paper is the development of a recoverability analysis. After extending the results in , a necessary and sufficient condition for recoverability of a source vector is obtained. Based on this condition and various types of source sparsity, several probability inequalities and probability estimates for the recoverability issue are established. Finally, simulation results that illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results are presented.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2005.861743","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1576973","Blind source separation (BSS);probability;recoverability;sparse representation;wavelet packets","Blind source separation;Source separation;Sparse matrices;Clustering algorithms;Signal processing algorithms;Linear programming;Signal processing;Dictionaries;Independent component analysis;Sufficient conditions","blind source separation;signal representation;sparse matrices;linear programming","undetermined blind source separation;sparse representation approach;mixing matrix;clustering algorithms;two-stage approach;linear programming algorithm;recoverability analysis","","191","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Huang","California PATH, Univ. of California at Berkeley, Richmond, CA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2006","7","4","415","428","The vehicle collision warning system (CWS) is an important research and application subject for vehicle safety. Most of this topic's research focuses on autonomous CWSs, where each vehicle detects potential collisions based entirely on the information measured by itself. Recently, an alternative scenario has arisen. This scenario is known as cooperative driving, where either the vehicle or the infrastructure can communicate its location, intention, or other information to surrounding vehicles or nearby infrastructure. Since installing a low-cost global-positioning-system (GPS) unit is becoming a common practice in vehicle applications, its implications in cooperative driving and vehicle safety deserve closer investigation. Furthermore, the future trajectory prediction may lead to a straightforward approach to detect potential collisions, yet its effectiveness has not been studied. This paper explores the engineering feasibility of a future-trajectory-prediction-based cooperative CWS when vehicles are equipped with a relatively simple differential GPS unit and relatively basic motion sensors. The goals of this paper are twofold: providing an engineering argument of possible functional architectures of such systems and presenting a plausible example of the proposed future-trajectory-based design, which estimates and communicates vehicle positions and predicts and processes future trajectories for collision decision making. In this paper, common GPS problems such as blockage and multipath, as well as common communication problems such as dropout and delays, are assumed.

The technique is based on the correlation of the two EGIs in the Fourier domain and makes use of the spherical and rotational harmonic transforms. For pairs with low overlap which fail a critical verification step, the rotational alignment can be obtained by the alignment of constellation images generated from the EGIs. Rotationally aligned sets are matched by correlation using the Fourier transform of volumetric functions.

In its simplest form, the frequency diverse array applies a linear phase progression across the aperture. This linear phase progression induces an electronic beam scan, as in a conventional phased array. When an additional linear frequency shift is applied across the elements, a new term is generated which results in a scan angle that varies with range in the far-field. This provides more flexible beam scan options, as well as providing resistance to point interference such as multipath. More general implementations provide greater degrees of freedom for space-time-frequency-phase-polarization control, permitting novel concepts for simultaneous multi-mission operation, such as performing synthetic aperture radar and ground moving target indication at the same time.","2375-5318","0-7803-9496-8","10.1109/RADAR.2006.1631800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1631800","","Frequency diversity;Radar;Phased arrays;Laboratories;Educational institutions;Interference;Aperture antennas;Antenna arrays;Linear antenna arrays;Pattern analysis","phased array radar;array signal processing;radar signal processing;aperture antennas;radar antennas","frequency diverse array radar;linear phase progression;electronic beam scanning;linear frequency shift;interference;degrees of freedom;space-time-frequency-phase-polarization control;multimission operation","","223","","3","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It represents an expansion of the speech quality measure qC, introduced by Hansen and Kollmeier, and is based on a psychoacoustically validated, quantitative model of the ""effective"" peripheral auditory processing by Dau et al. To evaluate the audio quality of a given distorted signal relative to a corresponding high-quality reference signal, the auditory model is employed to compute ""internal representations"" of the signals, which are partly assimilated in order to account for assumed cognitive aspects. The linear cross correlation coefficient of the assimilated internal representations represents the perceptual similarity measure (PSM). PSM shows good correlations with subjective quality ratings if different types of audio signals are considered separately, whereas a better accuracy of signal-independent quality prediction is achieved by a second quality measure PSMt represented by the fifth percentile of the sequence of instantaneous audio quality PSM(t). The new measures were evaluated using a large database of subjective listening tests that were originally carried out on behalf of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and Moving Pictures Experts Group (MPEG) for the evaluation of various low bit-rate audio codecs. Additional tests with data unknown in the development phase of the model were carried out.

Two capacitive-ended interdigital coupled lines are then formed to assign their transmission zero towards the fourth-order resonant frequency of this MMR, thereby suppressing the first spurious passband. Moreover, two outer arms in the interdigital lines are properly tapered to compensate the phase imbalance or group delay near the UWB upper-end relying on extra capacitive-ended stubs.

A closer look at these problems reveals the relation between them, and, as conventional color digital cameras suffer from both low-spatial resolution and color-filtering, it is reasonable to address them in a unified context. In this paper, we propose a fast and robust hybrid method of super-resolution and demosaicing, based on a maximum a posteriori estimation technique by minimizing a multiterm cost function. The L/sub 1/ norm is used for measuring the difference between the projected estimate of the high-resolution image and each low-resolution image, removing outliers in the data and errors due to possibly inaccurate motion estimation. Bilateral regularization is used for spatially regularizing the luminance component, resulting in sharp edges and forcing interpolation along the edges and not across them. Simultaneously, Tikhonov regularization is used to smooth the chrominance components. Finally, an additional regularization term is used to force similar edge location and orientation in different color channels. We show that the minimization of the total cost function is relatively easy and fast. Experimental results on synthetic and real data sets confirm the effectiveness of our method.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2005.860336","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1556633","Color enhancement;demosaicing;image restoration;robust estimation;robust regularization;super-resolution","Image resolution;Color;Spatial resolution;Cost function;Motion estimation;Image restoration;Digital cameras;Robustness;Maximum a posteriori estimation;Motion measurement","image segmentation;image resolution;optical filters;maximum likelihood estimation;motion estimation","multiframe demosaicing;color image superresolution;image restoration;color digital cameras;low-spatial resolution;color-filtering;maximum a posteriori estimation;multiterm cost function;motion estimation;bilateral regularization;luminance component;Tikhonov regularization;chrominance components;cost function","Algorithms;Color;Colorimetry;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique","204","","44","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the output power induced in the photovoltaic modules depends on solar radiation and temperature of the solar cells. Therefore, to maximize the efficiency of the renewable energy system, it is necessary to track the maximum power point of the PV array. In this paper, a maximum power point tracker using fuzzy set theory is presented to improve energy conversion efficiency. A new method is proposed, by using a fuzzy cognitive network, which is in close cooperation with the presented fuzzy controller.

The transceiver integrates conventionally discrete optoelectronic functions such as high-speed 10-Gb/s electro-optic modulation and 10-Gb/s optical reception on an SOI substrate using a standard CMOS process. The high optical index contrast between silicon (n=3.5) and its oxide (n=1.5) allows for very large scale integration of optical devices, while the use of a standard CMOS process allows these devices to be seamlessly fabricated together with electronics on the same substrate. Such a high level of optoelectronic integration is unprecedented, and serves to substantially reduce system footprint and power dissipation, allowing efficient scaling to higher data rates and broader functionality.

Indirect-conversion receiver architecture is chosen to reduce the dc offset and 1/f noise that can degrade the signal-to-noise ratio and detection accuracy. Furthermore, the double-sideband signals at the transmitter output can be in quadrature by choosing a proper frequency separation to relieve the severe null point problem that occurs at high frequency. As a result,the detection accuracy is significantly improved with low transmitted power.

By introducing a cross-coupled capacitance between input and output ports of this high-pass filter and suitably designing the transition stretch stubs, a compact three-pole ultra-wideband bandpass filter is implemented with two transmission zeros located close to the passband edges. To further improve the selectivity, two microstrip shorted stubs are added to implement a five-pole ultra-wideband bandpass filter with good out-of-band response. Being developed from the quasi-lumped elements, and not from the transmission lines, the proposed ultra-wideband filters have sizes more compact than those of the published wideband filters.

Conventional linear average SNR characterization of fading channel performance lacks generality, since the same linear SNR value may lead to drastic block error rate differences in various fading channels. A unified metric is proposed in this paper for link performance characterization and quality modeling. This paper proposes a mutual-information-based (Mi-based) link quality model, which contains separate modulation and coding models. The modulation model maps the received SNR to the mutual information symbol by symbol. The coding model maps the sum or average of the mutual information to decoding performance for each coding block. The existing methods based on the effective signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of a multi-state channel have limited accuracy in the mixed modulation cases. Compared with the existing models, the Mi-model is simpler and easier to apply to mixed-modulation cases and different H-ARQ schemes.

Thus, to properly design linearized OTAs, the frequency dependence of these coefficients must be determined. In this paper, we present a frequency-dependent harmonic-distortion analytical method applied to a linear-enhanced OTA. This OTA, which is suitable for high-frequency operation, uses three linearization techniques simultaneously: 1) attenuation through floating-gate MOS transistors; 2) source degeneration; and 3) polynomial cancellation techniques. By using the harmonic-distortion analysis, some properties on the performance of OTA are used to improve the performance of OTA-C based circuits at high frequencies.

By properly arranging the individual /spl lambda//4 SIR, which has the same fundamental resonance frequency f/sub 0/, but has different spurious (harmonic) resonance frequencies, and also carefully misaligning the maximum current density nodes, several higher order spurious resonances may be suppressed so that a BPF with wide stopband may be realized. In this study, the basic concept of multiple spurious suppression is demonstrated by thoroughly investigating the spurious characteristics of the fourth-order interdigital BPFs, which consist of two different types of /spl lambda//4 SIRs. To widen the rejection bandwidth, the fourth-order coupled-resonator BPFs based on three and four different types of /spl lambda//4 SIRs are implemented and carefully examined.

With this method, the antiwindup and the flux-weakening control can be achieved simultaneously.

Walsh, et al., 2006). A state-machine control strategy is written based on joint angle and ground-exoskeleton force sensing to control the joint actuation at this exoskeleton hip and knee. The joint components of the exoskeleton in the sagittal plane consist of a force-controllable actuator at the hip, a variable-damper mechanism at the knee and a passive spring at the ankle. The control is motivated by examining human walking data. Positive, non-conservative power is added at the hip during the walking cycle to help propel the mass of the human and payload forward. At the knee, the damper mechanism is turned on at heel strike as the exoskeleton leg is loaded and turned off during terminal stance to allow knee flexion. The passive spring at the ankle engages in controlled dorsiflexion to store energy that is later released to assist in powered plantarflexion. Preliminary studies show that the state machines for the hip and knee work robustly and that the onset of walking can be detected in less than one gait cycle. Further, it is found that an efficient, underactuated leg exoskeleton can effectively transmit payload forces to the ground during the walking cycle","2153-0866","1-4244-0258-1","10.1109/IROS.2006.281932","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4058569","exoskeleton;state-machine;control;walking","Exoskeletons;Knee;Hip;Legged locomotion;Humans;Payloads;Force control;Springs;Leg;Costs","force control;force sensors;medical robotics;vibration control","autonomous underactuated exoskeleton;load-carrying augmentation;state-machine control;ground-exoskeleton force sensing;joint actuation;force-controllable actuator;variable-damper mechanism;exoskeleton leg","","60","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Overview of IEC 61850 and benefits","R. E. Mackiewicz","SISCO Inc., MI, USA","2006 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","","2006","","","8 pp.","","Legacy substation automation protocols and architectures typically provided basic functionality for power system automation and were designed to accommodate the technical limitations of the networking technology available for implementation. There has recently been a vast improvement in networking technology that has changed dramatically what is now feasible for power system automation in the substation. Technologies such as switched Ethernet, TCP/IP, high-speed wide area networks, and high-performance low-cost computers are providing capabilities that could barely be imagined when most legacy substation automation protocols were designed. IEC61850 is an important new international standard for substation automation that will have a very significant impact on how electric power systems are designed and built for many years to come. IEC61850 is a part of the International Electrotechnical Commission's (IEC) Technical Committee 57 (TC57) architecture for electric power systems. The model-driven approach of the TC57 standards, including IEC61850, is an innovative approach that requires a new way of thinking about substation automation that will result in very significant improvements in both costs and performance of electric power systems. This half-day IEC61850 tutorial takes a practical approach to helping utility engineers understand how IEC61850 can be used to benefit their organization. The tutorial begins by explaining why these standards are important, how they differ from legacy technology, and how these differences benefit users. The student is then guided through the IEC61850 standard itself to illustrate how IEC68150 delivers these benefits via standardized device, object, and service models.

TOPS can be used with arbitrary shaped one-dimensional (1-D) or two-dimensional (2-D) arrays. Unlike other coherent wideband methods, such as the coherent signal subspace method (CSSM) and WAVES, the new method does not require any preprocessing for initial values. The performance of those wideband techniques and incoherent MUSIC is compared with that of the new method through computer simulations. The simulations show that this new technique performs better than others in mid signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ranges, while coherent methods work best in low SNR and incoherent methods work best in high SNR.

These tools are able to accurately simulate the device's wearout process and predict its impact on the circuit performance. Nevertheless, an excessive simulation time, a tedious device testing work, and a complex parameter extraction process often limit the popularity of these tools in the product design and fabrication stages. In this paper, a new simulation program with integrated circuits emphasis (SPICE) reliability simulation method is developed, which shifts the focus of the reliability analysis from the device wearout to the circuit functionality. A set of accelerated lifetime models and failure equivalent circuit models have been proposed for the most common silicon intrinsic wearout mechanisms, including hot-carrier injection, time-dependent dielectric breakdown, and negative bias temperature instability. The accelerated lifetime models help to identify the most degraded transistors in a circuit in terms of the device's terminal voltage and current stress profiles. Then, the corresponding failure equivalent circuit models are incorporated into the circuit to substitute these identified transistors. Finally, the SPICE simulation is performed again to check the circuit functionality and analyze the impact of the device wearout on the circuit operation. Device individual wearout effect is lumped into a very limited number of SPICE circuit elements within each failure equivalent circuit model, and the circuit performance degradation and functionality are determined by the magnitude of these additional circuit elements. In this new method, it is unnecessary to perform a large number of small-step iterative SPICE simulation process as other tools required to obtain the accuracy. Therefore, the simulation time is obviously shortened. In addition, a reduced set of failure equivalent circuit model parameters, rather than a large number of device SPICE parameters, need to be accurately characterized at each interim wearout process. Thus, the device testing and parameter extraction work are also significantly simplified. These advantages will allow the circuit designers to perform a quick and efficient circuit reliability analysis and to develop practical guidelines for reliable electronic designs","1558-2574","","10.1109/TDMR.2006.876572","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1673717","Accelerated lifetime models;circuit reliability simulation;CMOS;failure equivalent circuit models;hot-carrier injection (HCI);negative bias temperature instability (NBTI);simulation program with integrated circuits emphasis (SPICE);time-dependent dielectric breakdown","SPICE;Circuit simulation;Very large scale integration;Integrated circuit reliability;Equivalent circuits;Integrated circuit modeling;Circuit optimization;Circuit testing;Parameter extraction;Analytical models","circuit simulation;CMOS integrated circuits;equivalent circuits;hot carriers;integrated circuit modelling;integrated circuit reliability;life testing;SPICE;VLSI","SPICE reliability simulation;deep submicrometer CMOS VLSI circuits;very large scale integration;circuit reliability modeling;product design;reliability analysis;device wearout;accelerated lifetime models;failure equivalent circuit models;hot-carrier injection;time-dependent dielectric breakdown;negative bias temperature instability;current stress profiles;device testing;parameter extraction","","29","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The robust transmission scheme is composed of an orthogonal space-time block code (OSTBC), whose outputs are transmitted through the eigenmodes of the channel estimate with an appropriate power allocation among them. At the receiver, the signal is detected assuming a perfect channel knowledge. The optimization problem corresponding to the design of the power allocation among the estimated eigenmodes, whose goal is the maximization of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), is transformed to a simple convex problem that can be easily solved. Different sources of errors are considered in the channel estimate, such as the Gaussian noise from the estimation process and the errors from the quantization of the channel estimate, among others.

The hybrid power source composed of fuel cells and batteries provides a much higher peak power than each component alone while preserving high energy density, which is important and desirable for many modern electronic devices, through an appropriately controlled dc/dc power converter that handles the power flow shared by the fuel cell and the battery. Rather than being controlled to serve only as a voltage or current regulator, the power converter is regulated to balance the power flow to satisfy the load requirements while ensuring the various limitations of electrochemical components such as battery overcharge, fuel cell current limit (FCCL), etc. Digital technology is applied in the control of power electronics due to many advantages over analog technology such as programmability, less susceptibility to environmental variations, and low parts count. The user can set the FCCL, battery current limit, and battery voltage limit in the digital controller. A control algorithm that is suitable for regulating the multiple variables in the hybrid system is described by using a state-machine-based model; the issues about embedded control implementation are addressed; and the large-signal behavior of the hybrid system is analyzed on a voltage-current plane.

Anyway, both PR and HC necessitate the resonant frequency value inside their internal model. Normally, the nominal value of the grid frequency and its multiples are used, but in the case when the grid frequency experiences fluctuations, the performance of both PR and HC is diminished. This paper discuss the possibility of improving the behavior of resonant controller and harmonic compensator in the case of grid frequency variations. The proposed solution makes use of the frequency information provided by the phase-locked loop (PLL) system already used in most of DPGS today. Experimental results are presented in order to validate the proposed solution and it shows to work very well.","1048-2334","0-7803-9547-6","10.1109/APEC.2006.1620754","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1620754","","Programmable control;Adaptive control;Resonance;Control systems;Distributed power generation;Frequency;Power system harmonics;Pi control;Proportional control;Phase locked loops","power conversion harmonics;resonant power convertors;distributed power generation;adaptive control;phase locked loops","adaptive resonant controller;grid-connected converters;distributed power generation systems;harmonic compensator;proportional resonant controller;proportional integral controller;PI controller;grid connected system;DPGS;grid frequency variations;phase locked loop;PLL","","50","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work investigated a penalized weighted least-squares (PWLS) approach to address this problem in two dimensions, where the WLS considers first- and second-order noise moments and the penalty models signal spatial correlations. Three different implementations were studied for the PWLS minimization. One utilizes a Markov random field (MRF) Gibbs functional to consider spatial correlations among nearby detector bins and projection views in sinogram space and minimizes the PWLS cost function by iterative Gauss-Seidel algorithm. Another employs Karhunen-Loeve (KL) transform to de-correlate data signals among nearby views and minimizes the PWLS adaptively to each KL component by analytical calculation, where the spatial correlation among nearby bins is modeled by the same Gibbs functional. The third one models the spatial correlations among image pixels in image domain also by a MRF Gibbs functional and minimizes the PWLS by iterative successive over-relaxation algorithm. In these three implementations, a quadratic functional regularization was chosen for the MRF model. Phantom experiments showed a comparable performance of these three PWLS-based methods in terms of suppressing noise-induced streak artifacts and preserving resolution in the reconstructed images. Computer simulations concurred with the phantom experiments in terms of noise-resolution tradeoff and detectability in low contrast environment.

Contrary to such approaches, we advocate proactively detecting and identifying botnets prior to their being used as part of a cyber-attack (Strayer et al., 2006). In this paper, we present our work on using machine learning-based classification techniques to identify the command and control (C2) traffic of IRC-based botnets - compromised hosts that are collectively commanded using Internet relay chat (IRC). We split this task into two stages: (I) distinguishing between IRC and non-IRC traffic, and (II) distinguishing between botnet and real IRC traffic. For stage I, we compare the performance of J48, naive Bayes, and Bayesian network classifiers, identify the features that achieve good overall classification accuracy, and determine the classification sensitivity to the training set size. While sensitive to the training data and the attributes used to characterize communication flows, machine learning-based classifiers show promise in identifying IRC traffic. Using classification in stage II is trickier, since accurately labeling IRC traffic as botnet and non-botnet is challenging.

Commercially available third-generation (3G) products adopt a hybrid direct conversion architecture, where an inter-stage surface acoustic wave (SAW) filter between low noise amplifier (LNA) and mixer attenuates out-of-band interferers, alleviating linearity requirements set on the downconversion mixer. As a drawback, an off-chip component and an additional LNA are introduced, raising costs. Leveraging an in-depth analysis of second-order inter-modulation mechanisms in active downconversion mixers, this paper presents the design of a 0.18-/spl mu/m CMOS solution with outstanding linearity and noise performances. The input transconductor is RC degenerated, the output resistors are carefully matched and, most important, the parasitic capacitors at switching pair common sources are tuned out. Sixty samples from two distinct fabrication lots have been characterized. Minimum IIP2 is +78 dBm. For comparison, a second solution where inter-modulation products generated by the switching pair are not filtered out has been fabricated and tested. IIP2 values are always lower.

A directivity of about 600 is measured at f=14.80 GHz which is to our knowledge one of the highest directivities reported for an antenna using Fabry-Perot resonances.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2005.861578","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1573759","Directive antennas;Fabry–Perot resonators;leaky wave antennas","Directive antennas;Resonance;Photonic crystals;Optical resonators;Optical refraction;Dielectric resonator antennas;Metamaterials;Microwave antennas;Space technology;Prototypes","directive antennas;microstrip antenna arrays;Fabry-Perot resonators;cavity resonators","directive antenna;electromagnetic resonance;Fabry-Perot cavity;ground plane;metallic grid;patch antenna;14.80 GHz","","139","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The device consists of a curved, cantilevered steering arm, mounted on an untethered scratch drive actuator (USDA). These two components are fabricated monolithically from the same sheet of conductive polysilicon, and receive a common power and control signal through a capacitive coupling with an underlying electrical grid. All locations on the grid receive the same power and control signal, so that the devices can be operated without knowledge of their position on the substrate. Individual control of the component actuators provides two distinct motion gaits (forward motion and turning), which together allow full coverage of a planar workspace. These MEMS micro-robots demonstrate turning error of less than 3.7/spl deg//mm during forward motion, turn with radii as small as 176 /spl mu/m, and achieve speeds of over 200 /spl mu/m/sec with an average step size as small as 12 nm. They have been shown to operate open-loop for distances exceeding 35 cm without failure, and can be controlled through teleoperation to navigate complex paths. The devices were fabricated through a multiuser surface micromachining process, and were postprocessed to add a patterned layer of tensile chromium, which curls the steering arms upward. After sacrificial release, the devices were transferred with a vacuum microprobe to the electrical grid for testing. This grid consists of a silicon substrate coated with 13-/spl mu/m microfabricated electrodes, arranged in an interdigitated fashion with 2-/spl mu/m spaces. The electrodes are insulated by a layer of electron-beam-evaporated zirconium dioxide, so that devices placed on top of the electrodes will experience an electrostatic force in response to an applied voltage. Control waveforms are broadcast to the device through the capacitive power coupling, and are decoded by the electromechanical response of the device body. Hysteresis in the system allows on-board storage of n=2 bits of state information in response to these electrical signals. The presence of on-board state information within the device itself allows each of the two device subsystems (USDA and steering arm) to be individually addressed and controlled. We describe this communication and control strategy and show necessary and sufficient conditions for voltage-selective actuation of all 2/sup n/ system states, both for our devices (n=2), and for the more general case (where n is larger.).","1941-0158","","10.1109/JMEMS.2005.863697","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1588903","Actuator;control;electrostatic;fabrication;locomotion;MEMS;micro-robot;PolyMUMPS;robotics;scrath-drive;steering;untethered","Electrostatics;Micromechanical devices;Electrodes;Actuators;US Department of Agriculture;Turning;Communication system control;Motion control;Open loop systems;Navigation","microrobots;micromachining;electrostatic actuators;telerobotics","untethered microrobot;electrostatic microrobot;globally controllable microrobot;MEMS microrobot;untethered scratch drive actuator;capacitive coupling;motion gaits;forward motion;turning motion;turning error;open-loop operation;teleoperation;surface micromachining;vacuum microprobe;electrical grid;microfabricated electrodes;electron-beam evaporation;electrostatic force;control waveforms;capacitive power coupling;electromechanical response;hysteresis characteristic;on-board state information;steering arm;communication strategy;control strategy;voltage-selective actuation;locomotion;polyMUMPS;scrath drive;10 micron;13 micron;60 micron;250 micron","","229","","50","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Current work on highly integrated power management applications often requires the ability to measure voltage quantities that exceed the supply voltage in magnitude. This is primarily due to a basic need to maximize efficiency by running the power management IC on as low supply voltage as possible, while still maintaining the ability to sample and measure quantities from the surroundings that could well exceed the battery voltage. In this paper, a new bootstrapped switch is presented. The switch enables the precise sampling of input signals well greater than the chip supply voltage with no static power consumption, and without activating on-chip parasitic body diodes. The bootstrapped switch, presented here, is designed to sample an input signal with a 0-5.5-V range at a supply voltage of 2.75 V.

A repeatable binary string, which we call a biometric key, is generated reliably from genuine iris codes. A well-known difficulty has been how to cope with the 10 to 20 percent of error bits within an iris code and derive an error-free key. To solve this problem, we carefully studied the error patterns within iris codes and devised a two-layer error correction technique that combines Hadamard and Reed-Solomon codes. The key is generated from a subject's iris image with the aid of auxiliary error-correction data, which do not reveal the key and can be saved in a tamper-resistant token, such as a smart card. The reproduction of the key depends on two factors: the iris biometric and the token. The attacker has to procure both of them to compromise the key. We evaluated our technique using iris samples from 70 different eyes, with 10 samples from each eye. We found that an error-free key can be reproduced reliably from genuine iris codes with a 99.5 percent success rate. We can generate up to 140 bits of biometric key, more than enough for 128-bit AES. The extraction of a repeatable binary string from biometrics opens new possible applications, where a strong binding is required between a person and cryptographic operations. For example, it is possible to identify individuals without maintaining a central database of biometric templates, to which privacy objections-might be raised","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2006.138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1668036","Biometrics;iris code;Hadamard code;Reed-Solomon code.","","biometrics (access control);cryptography;error correction codes;Hadamard codes;Reed-Solomon codes","iris biometric system;cryptographic application;binary string;error correction technique;Hadamard codes;Reed-Solomon codes;smart card","","325","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The effects of noise, bandwidth, stationary echoes, kernel size, downsampling, interpolation, and quadrature demodulation on the accuracy of the time delay estimates are measured in terms of bias and jitter. Particular attention is given to the accuracy and resolution of the displacement measurements and to the computational efficiency of the algorithms. In most cases, Loupas' two-dimensional (2-D) autocorrelator performs as well as the gold standard, normalized cross correlation. However, Loupas' algorithm's calculation time is significantly faster, and it is particularly suited to operate on the signal data format most commonly used in ultrasound scanners.

This paper used a simple SRAM circuit as an example to demonstrate how to apply SPICE to circuit reliability modeling, simulation, analysis, and design. The SRAM circuit, implemented with a commercial 0.25-mum technology, consists of functional blocks of 1-bit six-transistor cell, precharge, read/write control, and sense amplifier. The SRAM operation sequence of ""write 0, read 0, write 1, read 1"" was first simulated in SPICE to obtain the terminal voltage and current stress profiles of each transistor. Then, normalized lifetimes of all transistors in terms of each failure mechanism were calculated with the corresponding accelerated lifetime models. These lifetime values were sorted to single out the most damaged transistors. Finally, the selected transistors were substituted with failure equivalent circuit models, and SPICE simulations were performed again to characterize the circuit performance, functionality, and failure behaviors. The simulation shows that the 0.25-mum technology, hot-carrier injection (HCI), and time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) had significant effects on SRAM-cell stability and voltage-transfer characteristics, while negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) mainly degraded the cell transition speed when the cell state flipped. This illustrative SRAM simulation work proves that, with SPICE and the failure equivalent circuit models, circuit designers can better understand the damage effects of HCI/TDDB/NBTI on the circuit operation, quickly estimate the circuit lifetime, make appropriate performance/reliability tradeoffs, and formulate practical design guidelines to improve the circuit reliability","1558-2574","","10.1109/TDMR.2006.876568","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1673716","Circuit-reliability analysis;failure mechanisms;reliability modeling;simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis (SPICE) simulation;SRAM","Random access memory;Circuit simulation;SPICE;Semiconductor device modeling;Integrated circuit reliability;Equivalent circuits;Acceleration;Integrated circuit modeling;Human computer interaction;Niobium compounds","equivalent circuits;failure analysis;integrated circuit modelling;integrated circuit reliability;life testing;SPICE;SRAM chips","SRAM circuit-failure modeling;reliability simulation;SPICE;accelerated lifetime models;failure equivalent circuit modeling;semiconductor wear out mechanisms;CMOS VLSI circuit;read/write control;sense amplifier;current stress profiles;hot-carrier injection;time-dependent dielectric breakdown;SRAM-cell stability;voltage-transfer characteristics;negative bias temperature instability;cell transition speed;circuit lifetime;0.25 micron;1 bit","","23","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The basic idea is to combine a ray tracing algorithm with the principles of physical optics (PO) and the physical theory of diffraction (PTD). The ray tracing algorithm stochastically launches discrete rays and uses a ray density normalization. In order to perform simulations at finite objects the PO/PTD formulation is required. Thus, fast intersection routines can be implemented, while the ray density formulation reduces the PO and PTD integrals to a pure sum of ray contributions. Simulation results obtained with this model are verified by comparison with both exact simulations using a method of moments (MoM) code and measurement results, proving an excellent accuracy and fast computation even at complex objects. With this asymptotic approach, scattering properties of large objects that are too complex for exact methods can be analyzed with rather moderate computation efforts. Typical applications include the simulation of low observability (LO) designs as well as the generation of databases for identifying unknown aircraft by their radar signature.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2006.875910","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1638375","Numerical modeling;physical optics (PO);physical theory of diffraction (PTD);radar cross section (RCS);ray tracing","Ray tracing;Computational modeling;Optical scattering;Radar scattering;Physical optics;Physical theory of diffraction;Moment methods;Observability;Databases;Aircraft","radar cross-sections;ray tracing;physical optics;physical theory of diffraction;electromagnetic wave scattering;method of moments;aircraft","ray tracing algorithm;physical optics;physical theory-of-diffraction;PO-PTD formulation;radar cross section;RCS modeling;field scattering;ray density normalization;intersection routines;method-of-moment;MoM code;low observability design;aircraft identification;radar signature","","92","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A completely specified n-input, n-output Boolean function is called reversible if it maps each input assignment to a unique output assignment and vice versa. Logic synthesis for reversible functions differs substantially from traditional logic synthesis and is currently an active area of research. The authors present an algorithm and tool for the synthesis of reversible functions. The algorithm uses the positive-polarity Reed-Muller expansion of a reversible function to synthesize the function as a network of Toffoli gates. At each stage, candidate factors, which represent subexpressions common between the Reed-Muller expansions of multiple outputs, are explored in the order of their attractiveness. The algorithm utilizes a priority-based search tree, and heuristics are used to rapidly prune the search space. The synthesis algorithm currently targets the generalized n-bit Toffoli gate library. However, other algorithms exist that can convert an n-bit Toffoli gate into a cascade of smaller Toffoli gates. Experimental results indicate that the authors' algorithm quickly synthesizes circuits when tested on the set of all reversible functions of three variables. Furthermore, it is able to quickly synthesize all four-variable and most five-variable reversible functions that were in the test suite. The authors also present results for some benchmark functions widely discussed in literature and some new benchmarks that the authors have developed. The algorithm is shown to synthesize many, but not all, randomly generated reversible functions of as many as 16 variables with a maximum gate count of 25","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2006.871622","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1715418","Quantum computing;reversible computing;reversible logic synthesis","Circuit synthesis;Logic circuits;Quantum computing;Network synthesis;Circuit testing;Boolean functions;Benchmark testing;Signal synthesis;Libraries;Computer industry","Boolean functions;high level synthesis;logic circuits;quantum computing;Reed-Muller codes","reversible logic circuits;quantum computing;Boolean function;unique output assignment;positive-polarity Reed-Muller expansion;Toffoli gates;priority-based search tree;reversible computing;reversible logic synthesis","","226","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Several anti-islanding methods that are resident in the inverter have been investigated and classified as passive (measurement of the natural effects of islanding) or active (based on the measurement of the effects due to transients or harmonics deliberately introduced in the system). In case the power drained by the load matches the power generated by the DG inverter, the effect of islanding is small, and the passive methods fail. However, the active methods, which have been developed to overcome these limits, create disturbances that can interact with those generated by other DG systems. In this paper, a new anti-islanding method is proposed. It exploits the natural sensitivity of a grid-voltage sensorless control to disturbances to highlight the islanding condition. The adopted grid-voltage sensorless control is adapted to a single-phase system with the use of resonant controllers based on the internal model control law: resonant-controller-based observer results. Then, a Kalman-filter-based algorithm is used to detect the islanding condition based on the energy mismatch between the estimated third and fifth harmonics and the real ones.

As the maximum efficiency conditions impose the level of converted power, an intermittent time-modulated operation mode is applied to the thermodynamic converter to obtain a variable converted mean power. A smoothly variable output power is achieved with the help of a supercapacitive auxiliary storage device used as a filter.

Numerous coalition formation algorithms have been proposed in the software agent literature. Algorithms exist that form agent coalitions in both super additive and non-super additive environments. The algorithmic techniques vary from negotiation-based protocols in multi-agent system (MAS) environments to those based on computation in distributed problem solving (DPS) environments. Coalition formation behaviors have also been discussed in relation to game theory. Despite the plethora of MAS coalition formation literature, to the best of our knowledge none of the proposed algorithms have been demonstrated with an actual multi-robot system.

For simplicity, customer classification techniques usually used the historic load curves of each user. The first step in the methodology presented in this paper is anomalous data filtering: holidays, maintenance, and wrong measurements must be removed from the database. Subsequently, two different treatments (frequency and time domain) of demand data were tested to feed SOM maps and evaluate the advantages of each approach. Finally, the ability of SOM to classify new customers in different clusters is also examined. Both steps have been performed through a well-known technique: SOM maps.

Thus, the proposed inverter is suitable for applications with low voltage sources such as batteries, fuel cells, or solar cells. Furthermore, three-level waveforms of the proposed inverter can be achieved without the switch voltage unbalance problem.

The PWM active inverter utilizes a voltage oriented control (VOC) control structure, using a Park transform, to convert the measured ac currents to synchronous reference properties (d-q reference). Since both the PLL and the VOC are sharing some common properties (Park transform, reference angle), they are combined in one circuit. A field programmable gate array (FPGA) is used for the purpose. Cumbersome algorithms like sine and cosine calculations are replaced by look-up tables. This provides a fast and reliable tool, and no other control circuits are needed for inverter operation.

Ramana.Reddy@mail.wvu.edu","2006 First International Symposium on Pervasive Computing and Applications","","2006","","","5","5","Summary form only given. Pervasive computing, also referred to sometimes as ubiquitous computing deals with the idea of making ""computing power"" available anyplace, anytime in a uniform way so that it may be exploited for meeting the challenges faced by society. The obvious analogy to this is the electric power infrastructures, which made the society's work and play more effective and enjoyable. Can pervasive computing also have a similar or greater impact on society? The answer is undoubtedly a resounding yes. However, we have a long way to go and overcome many a challenge. In this talk, we discuss these issues: the implications, opportunities and challenges pervasive computing. There have been steady advances in the area of computing hardware contributing to the dramatic affordability of computers. The revolution brought about by the Internet and the liberalization of the communications industry has brought the world closer. Now, it is no longer possible to even define what device may be termed a computer as ""computing"" becomes embedded in everyday appliances large and small ranging from cars to washing machines. The merger of computing and communications together with miniaturization is leading the way. However, for the promise of pervasive computing to frilly materialize, technology and support structures need to advance along four directions: computing, communication, cognition, and collaboration - the 4Cs of pervasive computing. Among the 4Cs the first two: computing and communications are rapidly advancing especially with the introduction of GPS as an embedded service. For a user to truly benefit from pervasive computing, the first two Cs are not enough. The supporting systems need to exhibit cognition - an understanding of the situation or ""context awareness"" as it is often called. For over fifty years the field of artificial intelligence has contributed many ideas (expert systems, planning, and natural language understanding - to name a few). The ideas of agent based computing and service based architectures are making contributions in this regard. The field of CSCW (computer supported collaborative work) and related research are contributing to the fourth C as it tries to make the world small by enabling people worldwide to work together - albeit with the great inconvenience of dealing with myriad disparate tools, technologies and standards. It is not difficult to speculate how the world of tomorrow will be as we make steady progress on the 4Cs and the resulting advances in pervasive computing. A few are listed below: knowledge workers - a universal knowledge based assistant that helps you to work seamlessly in your local space or shared space exploiting the ambient computing and connectivity; intelligent transportation - a car that avoids accidents, repairs itself and adapts itself to the geographic location and services that are accessible; pervasive healthcare - physicians who can diagnose and treat (reprogramming a device!) patients anywhere and anytime; context-aware appliances - washing machines that know the requirements of clothes that are about to be washed; and enterprises - routine formation of collaborative enterprises worldwide. These are but a few of the exciting things that await us as we come to terms with pervasive computing. However, we need to be cognizant about the many challenges such as loss of privacy and freedoms that are cherished by the societies","","1-4244-0325-1","10.1109/SPCA.2006.297455","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4079026","","Pervasive computing;Embedded computing;Home appliances;Washing machines;Cognition;Collaboration;Ubiquitous computing;Hardware;Internet;Communication industry","social aspects of automation;ubiquitous computing","pervasive computing;ubiquitous computing;computing power;computing hardware;Internet;embedded service;cognition;context awareness;computer supported collaborative work","","9","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium, 2006.","","2006","","","127","132","Reliability of an individual unit during field use is important in many critical applications such as turbine engines, life-maintaining systems and civil engineering structures. The remaining useful life (RUL) of the unit indicates its ability of surviving the operation in the future. When the failure indication (degradation) has been detected, it is essential to estimate the RUL accurately for making a timely maintenance decision for failure avoidance. In recent years, RUL prediction in service has received increasing attention. As many powerful sensors and signal processing techniques appear, multiple degradation features can be extracted for degradation detection and quantification. These features can serve as the basis for RUL prediction. This paper presents the proportional hazards model and logistic regression model, which relates the multiple degradation features of sensor signals to the specific reliability indices of the unit, and enable us to predict its RUL. Comparisons are made for the two models regarding their effectiveness and computation effort. An example of bearing test is provided to demonstrate the proposed approach in practical use.

The contourlet expansion is composed of basis images oriented at various directions in multiple scales, with flexible aspect ratios. Given this rich set of basis images, the contourlet transform effectively captures smooth contours that are the dominant feature in natural images. We begin with a detailed study on the statistics of the contourlet coefficients of natural images: using histograms to estimate the marginal and joint distributions and mutual information to measure the dependencies between coefficients. This study reveals the highly non-Gaussian marginal statistics and strong interlocation, interscale, and interdirection dependencies of contourlet coefficients. We also find that conditioned on the magnitudes of their generalized neighborhood coefficients, contourlet coefficients can be approximately modeled as Gaussian random variables. Based on these findings, we model contourlet coefficients using a hidden Markov tree (HMT) model with Gaussian mixtures that can capture all interscale, interdirection, and interlocation dependencies. We present experimental results using this model in image denoising and texture retrieval applications. In denoising, the contourlet HMT outperforms other wavelet methods in terms of visual quality, especially around edges. In texture retrieval, it shows improvements in performance for various oriented textures.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2006.873450","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1632214","Contourlets;image modeling;multidirection;multiscale;multiscale geometric analysis;statistical models;wavelets","Hidden Markov models;Wavelet transforms;Statistical distributions;Filter bank;Histograms;Mutual information;Random variables;Image denoising;Image retrieval;Noise reduction","wavelet transforms;channel bank filters;Gaussian distribution;hidden Markov models;image denoising;image texture;image retrieval","directional multiscale modeling;image processing;contourlet transform;wavelet transform;multiscale filter bank;directional filter bank;nonGaussian marginal statistics;Gaussian random variables;hidden Markov tree model;Gaussian mixtures;image denoising;image texture retrieval","Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical","363","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For short duration requirements battery storage can bring about frequency control and stability and for longer duration requirements they can bring about energy management or reserves.

The method is robust to: 1) spatial variations in illumination resulting from instrument limitations and changes both within, and between patient visits; 2) imaging artifacts such as dust particles; 3) outliers in the training data; 4) segmentation and alignment errors. Robustness to illumination variation is achieved by a novel iterative algorithm to estimate the reflectance of the retina exploiting automatically extracted segmentations of the retinal vasculature, optic disk, fovea, and pathologies. Robustness to dust artifacts is achieved by exploiting their spectral characteristics, enabling application to film-based, as well as digital imaging systems. False changes from alignment errors are minimized by subpixel accuracy registration using a 12-parameter transformation that accounts for unknown retinal curvature and camera parameters. Bayesian detection and classification algorithms are used to generate a color-coded output that is readily inspected. A multiobserver validation on 43 image pairs from 22 eyes involving nonproliferative and proliferative diabetic retinopathies, showed a 97% change detection rate, a 3 % miss rate, and a 10% false alarm rate. The performance in correctly classifying the changes was 99.3%. A self-consistency metric, and an error factor were developed to measure performance over more than two periods. The average self consistency was 94% and the error factor was 0.06%. Although this study focuses on diabetic changes, the proposed techniques have broader applicability in ophthalmology.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2005.863971","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1634503","Bayesian classification;change analysis;change detection;diabetic retinopathy;illumination correction;retinal image analysis","Robustness;Retina;Diabetes;Retinopathy;Lighting;Image segmentation;Patient monitoring;Instruments;Optical imaging;Training data","diseases;eye;patient monitoring;biomedical optical imaging;medical image processing;image colour analysis;image classification;time series;image segmentation;iterative methods;Bayes methods","robust detection;classification algorithm;longitudinal time-series changes;color retinal fundus images;diabetic retinopathy monitoring;illumination;imaging artifacts;dust particles;outliers;segmentation errors;alignment errors;iterative algorithm;reflectance;retinal vasculature;optic disc;fovea;film-based imaging systems;digital imaging systems;subpixel accuracy registration;Bayesian detection;self-consistency metric;ophthalmology","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Color;Colorimetry;Diabetic Retinopathy;Fluorescein Angiography;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Retina;Sensitivity and Specificity","97","","68","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In practice, a number of loads are nonlinear in nature, and therefore, they inject harmonics in the generating systems. The SEIG's performance, being a weak isolated system, is very much affected by these harmonics. The additional drawbacks of the SEIG are poor voltage regulation and that it requires an adjustable reactive power source with varying loads to maintain a constant terminal voltage. A three-phase insulated-gate-bipolar-transistor-based current-controlled voltage source inverter working as STATCOM is used for harmonic elimination, and it provides the required reactive power for the SEIG, with varying loads to maintain a constant terminal voltage. A dynamic model of the SEIG-STATCOM feeding nonlinear loads using stationary d-q axes reference frame is developed for predicting the behavior of the system under transient conditions. The simulated results show that SEIG terminal voltage is maintained constant, even with nonlinear balanced and unbalanced loads, and free from harmonics using STATCOM-based voltage regulator","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2006.882008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1705635","Harmonic elimination;load balancing;nonlinear loads;self-excited induction generator (SEIG);static compensator (STATCOM)","Automatic voltage control;Regulators;Induction generators;Reactive power;Performance analysis;STATCOM;Voltage control;Insulation;Inverters;Power system harmonics","asynchronous generators;electric current control;harmonics suppression;insulated gate bipolar transistors;invertors;machine control;power conversion harmonics;reactive power;static VAr compensators;voltage control;voltage regulators","static compensator;STATCOM;voltage regulator;selfexcited induction generator;nonlinear loads;harmonics injection;voltage regulation;adjustable reactive power source;three-phase insulated-gate-bipolar-transistor;current-control;voltage source inverter;harmonic elimination;dynamic model;transient conditions;load balancing","","123","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The waypoints, including the source and the destination, run a high-level intersegment routing protocol, while the nodes on each segment run a low-level intrasegment routing protocol. One distinct advantage of our model is that when a node on the route moves out or fails, instead of discarding the whole original route and discovering a new route from the source to the destination, only the two waypoint nodes of the broken segment have to find a new segment. In addition, our model is lightweight because it maintains a hierarchy only for nodes on active routes. On the other hand, existing hierarchical routing protocols such as CGSR and ZRP maintain hierarchies for the entire network. We present an instantiation of WPR, where we use DSR as the intersegment routing protocol and AODV as the intrasegment routing protocol. This instantiation is termed DSR over AODV (DOA) routing protocol. Thus, DSR and AODV - two well-known on-demand routing protocols for MANETs - are combined into one hierarchical routing protocol and become two special cases of our protocol. Furthermore, we present two novel techniques for DOA: one is an efficient loop detection method and the other is a multitarget route, discovery. Simulation results show that DOA scales well for large networks with more than 1,000 nodes, incurring about 60 percent-80 percent less overhead than AODV, while other metrics are better than or comparable to AODV and DSR","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2006.150","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1683789","Ad hoc networks;routing protocols;scalability;hierarchical;DSR;AODV;MANET.","Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Network topology;Scalability;Computer networks;Mobile computing;Pervasive computing;Cities and towns;Portable computers;Personal digital assistants","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols","DOA;DSR intersegment routing protocol;AODV intrasegment routing protocol;mobile ad hoc networks;lightweight hierarchical routing model;way point routing;hierarchical routing protocols;CGSR;ZRP;on-demand routing protocols;MANET;loop detection method;multitarget route","","64","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For the three-cell FCMI, four levels of operation are expected if the traditional ratio of the capacitor voltages is 1:2:3. However, by altering the ratio, the inverter can operate as a five-, six-, seven-, or eight-level inverter. According to previous research, the eight-level case is referred to as maximally distended (or full binary combination schema) since it utilizes all possible transistor switching states. However, this case does not have enough per-phase redundancy to ensure capacitor voltage balancing under all modes of operation. In this paper, redundancy involving all phases is used along with per-phase redundancy to improve capacitor voltage balancing. It is shown that the four- and five-level cases are suitable for motor drive operation and can maintain capacitor voltage balance under a wide range of power factors and modulation indices. The six-, seven-, and eight-level cases are suitable for reactive power transfer in applications such as static var compensation.

As reported earlier, our experiments demonstrate that very high information transfer rates can be achieved using the readiness potential (RP) when predicting the laterality of upcoming left- versus right-hand movements in healthy subjects. A more recent study showed that the RP similarly accompanies phantom movements in arm amputees, but the signal strength decreases with longer loss of the limb. In a complementary approach, oscillatory features are used to discriminate imagined movements (left hand versus right hand versus foot). In a recent feedback study with six healthy subjects with no or very little experience with BCI control, three subjects achieved an information transfer rate above 35 bits per minute (bpm), and further two subjects above 24 and 15 bpm, while one subject could not achieve any BCI control. These results are encouraging for an EEG-based BCI system in untrained subjects that is independent of peripheral nervous system activity and does not rely on evoked potentials even when compared to results with very well-trained subjects operating other BCI systems.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2006.875557","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1642756","Brain–computer interface (BCI);classification;common spatial patterns;electroencephalogram (EEG);event-related desynchronization (ERD);information transfer rate;machine learning;readiness potential (RP);single-trial analysis","Brain computer interfaces;Communication system control;Control systems;Electroencephalography;Machine learning;Imaging phantoms;Nervous system;Foot;Information analysis;Pattern analysis","electroencephalography;handicapped aids;learning (artificial intelligence);biomechanics;phantoms;bioelectric potentials;medical computing","Berlin Brain-Computer Interface project;EEG-based communication;motor competences;128-channel electroencephalogram;advanced machine learning;information transfer rates;readiness potential;hand movements;phantom;arm amputees;peripheral nervous system activity;evoked potentials","Algorithms;Communication Aids for Disabled;Computer User Training;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials;Germany;Humans;Imagination;Learning;Man-Machine Systems;Movement;Neuromuscular Diseases;Psychomotor Performance","190","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This performance is superior to the mixer operating in the gate-pumped mode where the mixer shows a conversion loss of 12-15dB over an RF frequency range of 6.5-20 GHz.

One technology area where both these communities can benefit is in the design and realization of new forms of terahertz antennas and beam forming networks. Both frequency domain and optical time domain techniques make use of single mode, broad band terahertz antennas. However, most existing instruments utilize very simple structures that have been imported from the microwave community. The very special needs of newly proposed terahertz instruments, especially very wide band-width spectroscopy and high resolution imagers, require new antenna concepts and new ways of implementing already established antenna designs. More traditional applications for terahertz systems, in radio astronomy, remote sensing and radar, generally require large diameter, high surface accuracy antenna dishes that can benefit from active surface correction, new light weight materials and compact designs.

As an economically efficient mechanism, nodal pricing would properly reward DG for reducing line losses through increased revenues at nodal prices and signal prospective DG where it ought to connect with the distribution network. Applying nodal pricing to a model distribution network, we show significant price differences between buses reflecting high marginal losses. Moreover, we show the contribution of a DG resource located at the end of the network to significant reductions in losses and line loading.

The data indicate that automated static analysis is an affordable means of software fault detection. Using the orthogonal defect classification scheme, we found that automated static analysis is effective at identifying assignment and checking faults, allowing the later software production phases to focus on more complex, functional, and algorithmic faults. A majority of the defects found by automated static analysis appear to be produced by a few key types of programmer errors and some of these types have the potential to cause security vulnerabilities. Statistical analysis results indicate the number of automated static analysis faults can be effective for identifying problem modules.

Firstly, to equivalently place the dead time element outside the closed-loop speed control, a dead time compensator (DTC), based on the Smith predictor and a self-tuning proportional-integral model-following controller (ST-PI-MFC) is proposed. The model-following error is used to adaptively update the gains of the ST-PI-MFC via the affine projection algorithm (APA). Secondly, a disturbance observer, based on the time delay control (TDC) approach is used for torque feed forward control. The system's model is greatly simplified when the disturbance observer is combined with the motor. Relying on the simplified model, a natural adaptive observer is used to estimate the motor speed. Unknown motor parameters are estimated by minimizing the state estimation error using an iterative gradient algorithm offered by the affine projection. The estimated parameters are used to update the gains of the integral-proportional (IP) servo loop controller, the disturbance observer and the Smith model.

In addition, a VCSEL-based disruptive technology enables various consumer applications such as a laser mouse and laser printers. In this paper, the recent advance of VCSEL photonics will be reviewed, which include the wavelength extension of single-mode VCSELs and their wavelength integration/control.

"Probabilistic Optimal Power Flow in Electricity Markets Based on a Two-Point Estimate Method","G. Verbic; C. A. Canizares","Fac. of Electr. Eng., Univ. of Ljubljana; NA","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","","2006","21","4","1883","1893","This paper presents an application of a two-point estimate method (2PEM) to account for uncertainties in the optimal power flow (OPF) problem in the context of competitive electricity markets. These uncertainties can be seen as a by-product of the economic pressure that forces market participants to behave in an ""unpredictable"" manner; hence, probability distributions of locational marginal prices are calculated as a result. Instead of using computationally demanding methods, the proposed approach needs 2n runs of the deterministic OPF for n uncertain variables to get the result in terms of the first three moments of the corresponding probability density functions. Another advantage of the 2PEM is that it does not require derivatives of the nonlinear function used in the computation of the probability distributions. The proposed method is tested on a simple three-bus test system and on a more realistic 129-bus test system. Results are compared against more accurate results obtained from MCS. The proposed method demonstrates a high level of accuracy for mean values when compared to the MCS; for standard deviations, the results are better in those cases when the number of uncertain variables is relatively low or when their dispersion is not large","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2006.881146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1717593","Electricity markets;probabilistic optimal power flow (OPF);probability distribution;two-point estimate method (2PEM);uncertainty","Load flow;Power markets;Uncertainty;Electricity supply industry;Probability distribution;System testing;Power system planning;Power system stability;Random variables;Taylor series","load flow;power markets;statistical distributions","probabilistic optimal power flow;electricity markets;two-point estimate method;probability distributions;locational marginal prices;probability density functions;nonlinear function;standard deviations;uncertain variables","","217","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to further improve the usability, we perform various studies on the data with a view to minimizing the training time required. We present data collected from nine healthy subjects, along with the high accuracies (of the order of 95% or more) measured online. We show that the training time can be further reduced by a factor of two from its current value of about 20 min.

Conventional contrast enhancement techniques either often fail to produce satisfactory results for a broad variety of low-contrast images, or cannot be automatically applied to different images, because their parameters must be specified manually to produce a satisfactory result for a given image. This paper describes a new automatic method for contrast enhancement. The basic procedure is to first group the histogram components of a low-contrast image into a proper number of bins according to a selected criterion, then redistribute these bins uniformly over the grayscale, and finally ungroup the previously grouped gray-levels. Accordingly, this new technique is named gray-level grouping (GLG). GLG not only produces results superior to conventional contrast enhancement techniques, but is also fully automatic in most circumstances, and is applicable to a broad variety of images. An extension of GLG, selective GLG (SGLG), and its variations will be discussed in Part II of this paper. SGLG selectively groups and ungroups histogram components to achieve specific application purposes, such as eliminating background noise, enhancing a specific segment of the histogram, and so on. The extension of GLG to color images will also be discussed in Part II.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2006.875204","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1658093","Contrast enhancement;gray-level grouping;histogram;quality measure","Optimization methods;Histograms;Gray-scale;Background noise;Image processing;Image segmentation;Color;Piecewise linear techniques;US Department of Energy","image enhancement","gray-level grouping;automatic contrast enhancement technique;optimized image contrast enhancement;low-contrast images;histogram components;selective GLG;background noise elimination;color images","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Colorimetry;Computer Simulation;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Quality Control","159","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, high temperature deposited SiN/sub x/ recipes gave a 1-2 orders reduction in surface leakage, whereas low temperature deposition gave an increase. Gate lag measurements were found to correlate closely with the surface leakage component, giving direct evidence that the key device problem of current slump is associated with current flow at the AlGaN surface.","1558-0563","","10.1109/LED.2005.860383","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1561436","Gallium nitride;heterostructure field-effect transistors (HFETs);SiN;leakage currents;gate lag;current slump","Leakage current;Silicon compounds;Aluminum gallium nitride;Temperature;Testing;Gallium nitride;HEMTs;MODFETs;Passivation;Gate leakage","field effect transistors;passivation;isolation technology;leakage currents;III-V semiconductors;wide band gap semiconductors;aluminium compounds;gallium compounds;silicon compounds","surface leakage currents;heterostructure field effect transistors;surface leakage test structure;passivation;gate leakage;bulk leakage;low temperature deposition;gate lag;current slump;SiN;AlGaN-GaN","","79","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Experimental results show that the supervised learning-based two-step procedure achieved a boundary disagreement (mean absolute distance) of 0.85 while the disagreement produced by the pixel classification-based color image segmentation method is 3.59. Second, we develop a new marker detection algorithm for watershed-based separation of overlapping or touching cells.

In one method, separate distance measures are calculated for numeric and nominal variables, respectively, and are then combined into an overall distance measure. In another method, nominal variables are converted into numeric variables, and then a distance measure is calculated using all variables.

The objectives of this paper are to: 1) compare the absolute and relative differences of the vegetation signal across these sensors from a user perspective, and, to a lesser degree, 2) evaluate the possibility of merging the AVHRR historical data record with that of the more modern sensors in order to provide historical perspective on current vegetation activities. The statistical and correlation analyses demonstrate that due to the similarity in their overall variance, it is not necessary to choose between the longer time series of AVHRR and the higher quality of the more modern sensors.

The key component that allows the user to control the exoskeleton is the human machine interface (HMI). Setting the HMI at the neuro-muscular level may lead to seamless integration and intuitive control of the exoskeleton arm as a natural extension of the human body. At the core of the exoskeleton HMI there is a model of the human muscle, the ""myoprocessor,"" running in real-time and in parallel to the physiological muscle, that predicts joint torques as a function of the joint kinematics and neural activation levels. This paper presents the development of myoprocessors for the upper limb based on the Hill phenomenological muscle model. Genetic algorithms are used to optimize the internal parameters of the myoprocessors utilizing an experimental database that provides inputs to the model and allows for performance assessment. The results indicate high correlation between joint moment predictions of the model and the measured data. Consequently, the myoprocessor seems an adequate model, sufficiently robust for further integration into the exoskeleton control system","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2006.880883","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1710181","Exoskeletons;genetic algorithms;muscle models","Exoskeletons;Humans;Muscles;Predictive models;Joints;Rehabilitation robotics;Pathology;Biological system modeling;Kinematics;Genetic algorithms","biomechanics;genetic algorithms;interactive systems;kinematics;medical robotics;muscle;neurophysiology;patient rehabilitation;torque","real-time myoprocessors;neural controlled powered exoskeleton arm;exoskeleton robots;assistive/rehabilitative devices;human machine interface;neuromuscular level;human muscle;joint torque;joint kinematics;neural activation levels;Hill phenomenological muscle model;genetic algorithms;joint moment;exoskeleton control system","Arm;Biomimetics;Biomimetics;Computer Systems;Computer-Aided Design;Cybernetics;Feedback;Humans;Models, Biological;Movement;Muscle, Skeletal;Orthotic Devices;Peripheral Nervous System;Robotics;Robotics;Skeleton;Therapy, Computer-Assisted;Therapy, Computer-Assisted","150","","41","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a canonical first-order delay model that takes into account both correlated and independent randomness is proposed. A novel linear-time block-based statistical timing algorithm is employed to propagate timing quantities like arrival times and required arrival times through the timing graph in this canonical form. At the end of the statistical timing, the sensitivity of all timing quantities to each of the sources of variation is available. Excessive sensitivities can then be targeted by manual or automatic optimization methods to improve the robustness of the design. This paper also reports the first incremental statistical timer in the literature, which is suitable for use in the inner loop of physical synthesis or other optimization programs. The third novel contribution of this paper is the computation of local and global criticality probabilities. For a very small cost in computer time, the probability of each edge or node of the timing graph being critical is computed. Numerical results are presented on industrial application-specified integrated circuit (ASIC) chips with over two million logic gates, and statistical timing results are compared to exhaustive corner analysis on a chip design whose hardware showed early mode timing violations","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2005.862751","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1677699","Criticality probability;incremental timing;statistical static timing;variability","Timing;Probability;Application specific integrated circuits;Digital integrated circuits;Delay;Optimization methods;Robustness;Costs;Logic gates;Logic design","application specific integrated circuits;digital integrated circuits;integrated circuit design;logic design;statistical analysis","timing verification;incremental timing;statistical static timing analysis;application specific integrated circuits;digital integrated circuits;timing graph","","132","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The three models are used to test if any transmission line, transformer, or busbar within a blackout area is faulty. They can deal with uncertain or incomplete data and knowledge relating to power system diagnosis, so they are flexible. The structures and initial parameters of the Bayesian networks depend on the prior knowledge of the domain experts. The parameters can be revised by using an error back propagation algorithm similar to the back-propagation algorithm for artificial neural networks. The fault diagnosis models do not vary with the change of the network structure, so they can be applied to any transmission power system. Furthermore, they have clear semantics, rapid reasoning, powerful error tolerance ability, and no convergence problem during the diagnosing procedure. Experimental tests show that the approach is feasible and efficient, so the prototype program based on the approach is promising to be used in a large transmission power system for online fault diagnosis.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2005.858774","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1610672","Bayesian networks;fault diagnosis;Noisy-And node;Noisy-Or node;parameter revision","Bayesian methods;Power system faults;Fault diagnosis;Power system modeling;Circuit faults;Power system restoration;Fuzzy logic;Uncertainty;Backpropagation algorithms;Fuzzy neural networks","power transmission lines;power transmission faults;fault diagnosis;belief networks;backpropagation;neural nets;power engineering computing","Bayesian network-based approach;power system fault diagnosis;noisy-or nodes;noisy-and nodes;power transmission systems;power transmission line;blackout area;power system diagnosis;error back propagation algorithm;artificial neural networks;online fault diagnosis;error tolerance ability","","134","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Attempting to address this gap, a research model is developed by integrating relevant antecedents from previous literature and empirically tested in the context of an e-Government service tailored for senior citizens. Our findings reveal that consistent with previous technology acceptance studies, senior citizens' use intention is driven by their perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of the service. Additionally, their Internet safety perception impacts the acceptance of this online financial service. Furthermore, resource savings and self-actualization determine senior citizens' usefulness perception, whereas computer anxiety and computing support are antecedents of perceived ease of use.

This paper presents a digital very large scale integrated (VLSI) design flow to create secure power-analysis-attack-resistant ICs.

By using two studies of business firms and academic institutions, this paper: 1) develops and tests a model relating alignment, its antecedents, and its consequences and 2) examines differences in these relationships across organizational types and strategies. Findings indicate that alignment depends on shared domain knowledge and prior IS success, and also support the expected positive impact of alignment on organizational performance. Differences across Prospector, Analyzer, and Defender business strategies are examined. A key research contribution is the empirical demonstration that the importance of alignment, as well as the mechanisms used to attain alignment, vary by business strategy and industry. In past alignment studies, controlling for industry has not been uncommon. The findings suggest that future research studies should also control for business strategy. The article also empirically demonstrates that past implementation success influences alignment. In addition, it highlights the influence of a process variable, strategic planning, on the development of shared knowledge and, consequently, on alignment. This paper examines strategic issues related to the management of technology. Data from multiple surveys are used to test the extent to which strategic planning, shared business-IS knowledge, prior IS success, and other variables consistently enhance IS alignment. The study also provides empirical support for the popular argument that IS alignment improves organizational performance. It extends the current literature by examining the extent to which these findings hold across firm strategies and industries. The authors argue that not all firms are equally well served by allocating scarce resources to improve IS alignment.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2005.861804","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1580892","Academic institutions;antecedents of alignment;business strategy;information systems strategy;organizational characteristics;organizational performance;strategic alignment","Business data processing;Information systems;Strategic planning","business data processing;knowledge management;information systems;strategic planning","antecedent;information systems alignment;empirical investigation;organizational strategy;business firm;academic institution;shared domain knowledge;prospector;defender business strategy;business industry;industrial control;strategic planning;technology management;multiple survey data;shared business-IS knowledge;scarce resource allocation;strategic alignment","","163","","71","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Stabilizing and tracking control of nonlinear dual-axis inverted-pendulum system using fuzzy neural network","Rong-Jong Wai; Li-Jung Chang","Dept. of Electr.

Eng., Yuan Ze Univ., Chung Li, Taiwan","IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","","2006","14","1","145","168","Since the dynamic characteristics of a nonlinear inverted-pendulum mechanism are highly nonlinear, it is difficult to design a suitable control system that realizes real time stabilization and accurate tracking control at all time. In this study, a robust fuzzy-neural-network (FNN) control system is implemented to control a dual-axis inverted-pendulum mechanism that is driven by permanent magnet (PM) synchronous motors. The energy conservation principle is adopted to build a mathematical model of the motor-mechanism-coupled system. Moreover, a robust FNN control system is developed for stabilizing and tracking control of the dual-axis inverted-pendulum system. In this control system, a FNN controller is used to learn an equivalent control law as in the traditional sliding-mode control, and a robust controller is designed to ensure the near total sliding motion through the entire state trajectory without a reaching phase. The salient advantages of this FNN-based control scheme are as follows. 1) It does not require a perfect knowledge of system uncertainties so that this brings a high level of autonomy to the overall system and make the use of this control scheme very attractive for real time applications. 2) All adaptive learning algorithms in this control system are derived in the sense of Lyapunov stability analysis, so that system-tracking stability can be guaranteed in the closed-loop system. 3) Not only the weight vector in the rule-to-output layer are adjusted on line but also the mean and the standard deviation of Gaussian functions in the membership function layer. This training scheme will increase the learning capability of the FNN. 4) An adaptive bound estimation algorithm is investigated to relax the requirement for the bound of uncertain term including the minimum reconstructed error, higher-order term in Taylor series, and network parameters approximation error. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy can be verified by numerical simulation and experimental results.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2005.859305","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1593649","Energy conservation principle;fuzzy neural network (FNN);inverted pendulum;permanent magnet synchronous motor;robust control","Nonlinear control systems;Control systems;Fuzzy neural networks;Fuzzy control;Sliding mode control;Motion control;Robust control;Real time systems;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Synchronous motors","nonlinear control systems;pendulums;robust control;fuzzy neural nets;neurocontrollers;fuzzy control;permanent magnet motors;synchronous motors;energy conservation;variable structure systems;uncertain systems;adaptive control;learning systems;Lyapunov methods;closed loop systems;Gaussian processes;control system synthesis","tracking control;nonlinear dual-axis inverted-pendulum system;real time stabilization;robust fuzzy-neural-network control system;permanent magnet synchronous motors;energy conservation principle;sliding-mode control;system uncertainties;adaptive learning algorithm;Lyapunov stability analysis;closed-loop system;Gaussian functions","","32","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Isenburg","Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; University of California, Berkeley","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","","2006","12","5","1245","1250","Large scale scientific simulation codes typically run on a cluster of CPUs that write/read time steps to/from a single file system. As data sets are constantly growing in size, this increasingly leads to I/O bottlenecks. When the rate at which data is produced exceeds the available I/O bandwidth, the simulation stalls and the CPUs are idle. Data compression can alleviate this problem by using some CPU cycles to reduce the amount of data needed to be transfered. Most compression schemes, however, are designed to operate offline and seek to maximize compression, not throughput. Furthermore, they often require quantizing floating-point values onto a uniform integer grid, which disqualifies their use in applications where exact values must be retained. We propose a simple scheme for lossless, online compression of floating-point data that transparently integrates into the I/O of many applications. A plug-in scheme for data-dependent prediction makes our scheme applicable to a wide variety of data used in visualization, such as unstructured meshes, point sets, images, and voxel grids. We achieve state-of-the-art compression rates and speeds, the latter in part due to an improved entropy coder. We demonstrate that this significantly accelerates I/O throughput in real simulation runs.

A common technique used to improve the performance of data access is caching. Cooperative caching, which allows the sharing and coordination of cached data among multiple nodes, can further explore the potential of the caching techniques. Due to mobility and resource constraints of ad hoc networks, cooperative caching techniques designed for wired networks may not be applicable to ad hoc networks. In this paper, we design and evaluate cooperative caching techniques to efficiently support data access in ad hoc networks. We first propose two schemes: CacheData, which caches the data, and CachePath, which caches the data path. After analyzing the performance of those two schemes, we propose a hybrid approach (HybridCache), which can further improve the performance by taking advantage of CacheData and CachePath while avoiding their weaknesses. Cache replacement policies are also studied to further improve the performance. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes can significantly reduce the query delay and message complexity when compared to other caching schemes.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2006.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542018","Index Terms- Cooperative cache;cache management;cache replacement policy;ad hoc networks;data dissemination;simulations.","Cooperative caching;Intelligent networks;Ad hoc networks;Bandwidth;Delay;Performance analysis;Disaster management;Assembly;Routing protocols;Batteries","ad hoc networks;cache storage;mobile radio","cooperative caching;ad hoc networks;data access;mobility constraints;resource constraints;CacheData;CachePath;cache replacement policy;query delay;message complexity","","294","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Battery-operated sensor nodes have limited energy storage capability due to small form-factors, or operate in environments that rule out frequent energy replenishment, resulting in a mismatch between the available energy budget for system operation and the required energy budget to obtain desired lifetimes. This article surveys several techniques that show promise in addressing and alleviating this energy consumption challenge.

The existing methods for active noise control systems with online secondary path modeling consist of three adaptive filters. The main feature of the proposed method is that it uses only two adaptive filters. In the proposed method, the modified-FxLMS (MFxLMS) algorithm is used in adapting the noise control filter and a new variable step size (VSS) least mean square (LMS) algorithm is proposed for adaptation of the secondary path modeling filter. This VSS LMS algorithm is different from the normalized-LMS (NLMS) algorithm, where the step size is varied in accordance with the power of the reference signal. Here, on the other hand, the step size is varied in accordance with the power of the disturbance signal in the desired response of the modeling filter. The basic idea of the proposed VSS algorithm stems from the fact that the disturbance signal in the desired response of the modeling filter is decreasing in nature, (ideally) converging to zero. Hence, a small step size is used initially and later its value is increased accordingly. The disturbance signal, however, is not available directly, and we propose an indirect method to track its variations. Computer simulations show that the proposed method gives better performance than the existing methods. This improved performance is achieved at the cost of a slightly increased computational complexity.","1558-7924","","10.1109/TSA.2005.855829","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1597274","Active noise control;FxLMS algorithm;modified FxLMS algorithm;online secondary path modeling;variable step size least mean square (VSS LMS) algorithm","Least squares approximation;Active noise reduction;Control system synthesis;Size control;Adaptive filters;Variable structure systems;Computational complexity;Noise cancellation;Noise reduction;Convergence","least mean squares methods;active noise control;adaptive filters;computational complexity;acoustic signal processing","LMS algorithm;active noise control systems;online secondary path modeling;adaptive filters;least mean square;disturbance signal;computational complexity;variable step size","","130","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, a few circuit examples of building blocks in receiver signal chain are analyzed to show a linear relationship between power and dynamic range of the blocks. The result is then used to derive the optimal system specification distribution among receiver signal chain building blocks yielding the minimum total receiver power consumption for a given system performance.

In this paper, we compare the performance between four vertical handoff decision algorithms, namely, MEW (multiplicative exponent weighting), SAW (simple additive weighting), TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution), and GRA (grey relational analysis). All four algorithms allow different attributes (e.g., bandwidth, delay, packet loss rate, cost) to be included for vertical handoff decision.

With the exhaustion of fossil resources the energy economy will change from a chemical to an electrical base. This transition is one of physics, not one of politics. It must be based on proven technology and existing engineering experience. The transition process will take many years and should start soon. Unfortunately, politics seems to listen to the advice of visionaries and lobby groups. Many of their qualitative arguments are not based on facts and physics. A secure sustainable energy future cannot be based on hype and activism, but has to be built on solid grounds of established science and engineering. In this paper the energy needs of a hydrogen economy are quantified. Only 20%-25% of the source energy needed to synthesized hydrogen from natural compounds can be recovered for end use by efficient fuel cells. Because of the high energy losses within a hydrogen economy the synthetic energy carrier cannot compete with electricity.

Moreover, under such operation, SEIG requires constant capacitance for excitation resulting in a fixed-point operation. For this purpose, a suitable control scheme has to be developed such that the load on the SEIG remains constant despite change in the consumer load. In such applications, water is freely available and, hence, a simple and cheap controller has to be developed, which can operate almost unattended in remote and hilly regions. The proposed ELC consists of an uncontrolled rectifier and chopper with a series ""dump"" load. Proper design of rectifier, chopper, and dump load is very important for troublefree operation of ELC.

These techniques use two different models (the reference model and the adjustable model) which have made the speed estimation a reliable scheme especially when the motor parameters are poorly known or having large variations. The scheme uses the error vector from the comparison of both models as the feedback for speed estimation. Depending on the type of tuning signal driving the adaptation mechanism, there could be a number of schemes available such as rotor flux based MRAS, back e.m.f based MRAS, reactive power based MRAS and artificial neural network based MRAS. All these schemes have their own trends and tradeoffs. In this paper, the performance of the rotor flux based MRAS (RF-MRAS) and back e.m.f based MRAS (BEMF-MRAS) for estimating the rotor speed was studied. Both schemes use the stator equation and rotor equation as the reference model and the adjustable model respectively. The output error from both models is tuned using a PI controller yielding the estimated rotor speed. The dynamic response of the RF-MRAS and BEMF-MRAS sensorless speed estimation is examined in order to evaluate the performance of each scheme.","","1-4244-0273-5","10.1109/PECON.2006.346686","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4154530","BEMF-MRAS;MRAS;parameter variations;RF-MRAS;sensorless speed;tracking capability","Induction motor drives;MATLAB;Mathematical model;Rotors;Equations;Adaptive systems;Stability;Neurofeedback;Reactive power;Artificial neural networks","angular velocity control;angular velocity measurement;electric machine analysis computing;induction motor drives;machine vector control;magnetic flux;model reference adaptive control systems;PI control;rotors;stators;tuning","model reference adaptive system;speed sensorless estimation;induction motor drives;MATLAB;SIMULINK;rotor speed estimation;stability approach;motor parameters;error vector;rotor flux;back emf;rotor flux based MRAS;back emf based MRAS;reactive power based MRAS;artificial neural network based MRAS;stator equation;rotor equation;PI controller;dynamic response","","22","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paper considers the evaluation of the error probability of an OFDM system transmitting over channels characterized by frequency selectivity and Rayleigh fading. The time variations of the channel during one OFDM symbol interval destroy the orthogonality of the different subcarriers and generate power leakage among the subcarriers, known as inter-carrier interference (ICI). For conventional modulation methods such as phase-shift keying (PSK) and quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM), the bivariate probability density function (pdf) of the ICI is shown to be a weighted Gaussian mixture. The large computational complexity involved in using the weighted Gaussian mixture pdf to evaluate the error probability serves as the motivation for developing a two-dimensional Gram-Charlier representation for the bivariate pdf of the ICI. It is demonstrated that its truncated version of order 4 or 6 provides a very good approximation in the evaluation of the error probability for PSK and QAM in the presence of ICI. Based on Jakes' model for the Doppler effects, and an exponential multipath intensity profile, numerical results for the error probability are illustrated for several mobile speeds","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2006.1638663","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1638663","","Degradation;Error probability;Digital video broadcasting;Phase shift keying;Phase modulation;OFDM modulation;Quadrature amplitude modulation;RF signals;Land mobile radio;Rayleigh channels","computational complexity;Doppler effect;error statistics;Gaussian processes;mobile radio;OFDM modulation;phase shift keying;quadrature amplitude modulation;radiofrequency interference;Rayleigh channels","Doppler spreading;OFDM systems;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;mobile radio;error probability;frequency selectivity channels;Rayleigh fading channels;inter-carrier interference;ICI;bivariate probability density function;weighted Gaussian mixture;computational complexity;multipath intensity profile;PSK;QAM","","124","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two kinds of watermarking algorithms are usually used: the watermarking algorithms using pseudorandom patterns and those using visual recognizable patterns. The main advantage of watermarking algorithms embedding a visual recognizable pattern, which can be the owner or provider logotype, is that after the extraction process the pattern can be visually recognized and then identified. In general the visual recognizable patterns has a large impact and less ambiguity during the copyright claim process as compared with the random patterns, however the amount of information required by the visual recognizable pattern is much larger than the amount of information required by the pseudorandom one, and then to achieve imperceptibility and robustness of the watermark is more difficult. This paper proposes a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based watermark embedding algorithm for visual recognizable pattern which uses the relation between the human visual system and the DWT for embedding the watermark is such way that it becomes imperceptible and robust.

Our system uses an adaptive algorithm, based on kernel partial least squares classification (KPLS), to associate patterns in multichannel EEG frequency spectra with cursor controls. Our first BCI, Target Practice, is a system for one-dimensional device control, in which participants use biofeedback to learn voluntary control of their EEG spectra. Target Practice uses a KPLS classifier to map power spectra of 62-electrode EEG signals to rightward or leftward position of a moving cursor on a computer display. Three subjects learned to control motion of a cursor on a video display in multiple blocks of 60 trials over periods of up to six weeks. The best subject's average skill in correct selection of the cursor direction grew from 58% to 88% after 13 training sessions. Target Practice also implements online control of two artifact sources: 1) removal of ocular artifact by linear subtraction of wavelet-smoothed vertical and horizontal electrooculograms (EOG) signals, 2) control of muscle artifact by inhibition of BCI training during periods of relatively high power in the 40-64 Hz band. The second BCI, Think Pointer, is a system for two-dimensional cursor control. Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) are triggered by four flickering checkerboard stimuli located in narrow strips at each edge of the display. The user attends to one of the four beacons to initiate motion in the desired direction. The SSVEP signals are recorded from 12 electrodes located over the occipital region. A KPLS classifier is individually calibrated to map multichannel frequency bands of the SSVEP signals to right-left or up-down motion of a cursor on a computer display. The display stops moving when the user attends to a central fixation point. As for Target Practice, Think Pointer also implements wavelet-based online removal of ocular artifact; however, in Think Pointer muscle artifact is controlled via adaptive normalization of the SSVEP. Training of the classifier requires about 3 min. We have tested our system in real-time operation in three human subjects. Across subjects and sessions, control accuracy ranged from 80% to 100% correct with lags of 1-5 s for movement initiation and turning. We have also developed a realistic demonstration of our system for control of a moving map display (http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/).","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2006.875578","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1642775","Brain–computer interfaces (BCI);electroencephalogram (EEG);kernel partial least squares (KPLS);steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP)","Brain computer interfaces;Electroencephalography;Steady-state;Computer displays;Control systems;Frequency;Muscles;Testing;Adaptive algorithm;Kernel","electroencephalography;visual evoked potentials;handicapped aids;medical control systems;adaptive signal processing;least squares approximations;signal classification;medical signal processing;smoothing methods","brain-computer interfaces;BCI;1-D cursor control;2-D cursor control;volitional control;multichannel EEG frequency spectra;steady-state visual evoked potentials;electroencephalogram;adaptive algorithm;kernel partial least squares classification;biofeedback;power spectra;video display;ocular artifact removal;wavelet-smoothed vertical electrooculograms signals;wavelet-smoothed horizontal electrooculograms signals;EOG;muscle artifact;flickering checkerboard stimuli;electrodes;occipital region;computer display;adaptive normalization;classifier","Algorithms;Communication Aids for Disabled;Computer Peripherals;Data Display;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials, Visual;Feedback;Humans;Man-Machine Systems;Task Performance and Analysis;User-Computer Interface;Visual Cortex;Volition","165","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our mathematical analysis is based on electromagnetic theory. The results indicate that the effective complex magnetic permeability and dielectric permittivity values of the RAM increase as the carbonyl iron volume fraction increases. For sample thickness of 3.0 mm, an increase in carbonyl iron content reduces the minimum reflection loss from -1.3 to -23.9 dB and shifts the frequency of the minimum reflection loss from 15.5 to 3.5 GHz. For an equal volume fraction of carbonyl iron, the frequency of the minimum reflection loss decreases as the thickness is increased. However, the dip in the reflection loss plot (in decibels) initially decreases to a minimum value before it increases with a further increase in thickness.

FACTS can perform all objectives of reactive power control and voltage control within the transmission and distribution networks and at load terminals. Several schemes of flexible AC transmission systems FACTS are either in use today. One of the most important FACTS devices is the Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC), which is used to investigate its effect on load flow and loss reduction in power system. The UPFC is a combination of a static shunt synchronous series compensator (STATCOM) and a static synchronous series compensator (SSSC), which are coupled via a common DC link. The UPFC is a device, which can control simultaneously all the three parameters of line power flow which are line impedance, voltage and phase angle. The UPFC improves terminal voltage regulation, series capacitor compensation and transmission angle regulation. The main objectives of this work are to develop a new basic control scheme and comprehensive analysis for a unified power flow controller (UPFC) also to develop MATLAB program which simulate the UPFC and its action on the power system. This developed technique showed to be very effective and it will enable engineers to study and investigate how the UPFC can affect the transmission system using the series voltage and shunt current injection. It was possible to demonstrate that the UPFC can improve the system characteristics and gives the best transient and dynamic stability. It can highly improves the power factor. Many cases are investigated and studied such as application of the UPFC to control voltage and power flow. The cases are tested for the same simulated power system but with different load types and different system voltages.

Traditionally, the analysis for pull-in has been done using quasi-static assumptions. However, it was recently shown experimentally that a step input can cause a decrease in the voltage required for pull-in to occur. We propose an energy-based solution for the step voltage required for pull-in that predicts the experimentally observed decrease in the pull-in voltage. We then use similar energy techniques to explore pull-in due to an actuation signal that is modulated depending on the sign of the velocity of the plate (i.e., modulated at the instantaneous mechanical resonant frequency). For this type of actuation signal, significant reductions in the pull-in voltage can theoretically be achieved without changing the stiffness of the structure. This analysis is significant to both parallel-plate and torsional electrostatic microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) switching structures where a reduced operating voltage without sacrificing stiffness is desired, as well as electrostatic MEMS oscillators where pull-in due to dynamic effects needs to be avoided","1941-0158","","10.1109/JMEMS.2006.879121","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1668176","Electrostatic devices;microactuators;microelectromechanical systems (MEMS);microresonators;nonlinear systems;switches","Micromechanical devices;Electrostatic actuators;Voltage;Electrodes;Limit-cycles;Microelectromechanical systems;Switches;Laboratories;Electrostatic analysis;Resonant frequency","electrostatic actuators;microswitches;plates (structures)","parallel-plate actuators;torsional electrostatic actuators;MEMS oscillators;microactuators;microelectromechanical systems;microresonators;nonlinear systems;microswitches","","100","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Some of these characteristics are: passive ac load can be supplied; active and reactive power can be controlled separately and simultaneously; no requirement for fast communication between VSC stations. Based on the method of current injection at the ac bus of voltage source converter, the detailed dynamic model for VSC- HVCD is developed. This model includes three parts, i.e. the quasi-steady model for the ac side of voltage source converter, the dynamic model for VSC-HVDC inner dc system and the model for VSC-HVDC control system. With the help of User Program Interface function provided by Power System Analysis Software Package (PSASP/UPI), the transient simulation algorithm for VSC-HVDC is designed. Simulation results for multi-machine system with VSC-HVDC has verified the developed VSC-HVDC dynamic model and the designed transient simulation algorithm.

The reusable components, called intellectual property (IP) blocks or cores, are typically synthesizable register-transfer level (RTL) designs (often called soft cores) or layout level designs (often called hard cores). The concept of reuse can be carried out at the block, platform, or chip levels, and involves making the IP sufficiently general, configurable, or programmable, for use in a wide range of applications. The IP integration issues include connecting the computational units to the communication medium, which is moving from ad hoc bus-based approaches toward structured network-on-chip (NoC) architectures.

The advantage of fuzzy logic control is that it does not require a mathematical model of the system. The application of the Mamdani-type fuzzy logic controller to a three-phase shunt active power filter was investigated earlier but it has the limitation of a larger number of fuzzy sets and rules. Therefore, it needs to optimize a large number of coefficients, which increases the complexity of the controller. On the other hand, TS fuzzy controllers are quite general in that they use arbitrary input fuzzy sets, any type of fuzzy logic, and the general defuzzifier. Moreover, the TS fuzzy controller could be designed by using a lower number of rules and classes. Further, in this paper, the hysteresis current control mode of operation is implemented for pulsewidth-modulation switching signal generation. Computer simulation results show that the dynamic behavior of the TS fuzzy controller is better than the conventional proportional-integral (PI) controller and is found to be more robust to changes in load and other system parameters compared to the conventional PI controller.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2005.860263","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1645189","Dynamic behavior of the controller;power quality improvement;shunt active power filter;Takagi–Sugeno (TS) fuzzy logic controller","Active filters;Load management;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy control;Pi control;Proportional control;Takagi-Sugeno model;Power quality;Reactive power control","fuzzy control;active filters;power filters;fuzzy logic;power supply quality;fuzzy set theory;electric current control;pulse width modulation;PI control;robust control","TS-fuzzy-controlled active power filter;load compensation;Takagi-Sugeno-type fuzzy logic controller;three-phase shunt active power filter;power quality improvement;mathematical model;Mamdani-type fuzzy logic controller;fuzzy sets;hysteresis current control mode;pulse width modulation switching signal generation;computer simulation;proportional-integral controller;PI controller;robust control","","103","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As system architects and designers leverage ever-increasing CMOS technology densities, a range of two- and three-dimensional silicon integration technologies are emerging which will likely support next-generation high-volume electronic applications and may serve high-performance computing applications. This paper will discuss a few emerging technologies which offer opportunities for enhanced circuit performance, or reduced power as one example. Silicon-on-silicon integration may include three-dimensional (3-D) integration on-chip or may leverage chip stacking or chip integration on package. Common technology features include silicon through-vias, high-I/O interconnection and silicon-on-silicon either as 3-D integrated circuits, integrated chip stacks or silicon-on-silicon packages with passive function or high-bandwidth wiring. Silicon chips on silicon interposers with integrated function such as decoupling capacitors may provide a better module architecture compared to increased on-chip decoupling or off chip discrete capacitors mounted on package at the chip perimeter or underside of the package. Advanced silicon carrier package technology with fine pitch (50 mum) interconnection is described. This silicon carrier package contains silicon through-vias and offers >16times increase over standard chip I/O, a 20times to 100times increase in wiring density over traditional organic and ceramic packaging, and allows for integrated high-performance passives. Silicon carrier technology supports lithographic scaling and provides a basis for known good die (KGD) wafer testing.

This leads to high false positive rate of supervised NIDSs. Unsupervised outlier detection can overcome the drawbacks of supervised anomaly detection. Therefore, we apply one of the efficient data mining algorithms called random forests algorithm in anomaly based NIDSs. Without attack-free training data, random forests algorithm can detect outliers in datasets of network traffic. In this paper, we discuss our framework of anomaly based network intrusion detection. In the framework, patterns of network services are built by random forests algorithm over traffic data. Intrusions are detected by determining outliers related to the built patterns. We present the modification on the outlier detection algorithm of random forests. We also report our experimental results over the KDD'99 dataset.

For this task automated guided vehicle systems (AGVS) provide special benefits. Main points of these systems are the centrally controlled automated guided vehicles (AGV). In the beginning, the vehicles were guided by optical or inductive guidelines. The main disadvantages of guidelines are the inflexibility concerning the modification and changing of the routing and the necessity of installations on or in the ground. New developments result in systems without guidelines. An example of this development is the laser guidance for the AGV. The AGVs have a high individuality. They are usually developed and constructed for the demands of a special application and are therefore unique. Due to this individuality a special problem is the wide variety of maintenance and part logistics. Research and development leads to new approaches to this question. Examples are the implementation of the modulation of AGV and the implementation of construction kits. Further points are the reduction of complexity of the modules and the establishment of compatibility between various AGVS-producers. Another main direction of the development is the supplementary automation of standard fork lift trucks. Applications of AGVS exist in all fields of industry and trade. Typical examples are the use in assembly lines, warehouses, order picking systems and production plants. Based on the AGVS-Statistic Europe, which is created and administrated by the Department of planning and controlling of warehouse and transport systems (PSLT), the main application of AGVS and the sectors in which they are used are analyzed. With this database developments and current trends in the AGVS-sector are identified. More and more the AGVS-producers have to offer their products in a global competition.

However, there are still open issues that, if suitably addressed, could allow further improvement of their performances in terms of classification accuracy. Two especially critical issues are: 1) the determination of the most appropriate feature subspace where to carry out the classification task and 2) model selection. In this paper, these two issues are addressed through a classification system that optimizes the SVM classifier accuracy for this kind of imagery. This system is based on a genetic optimization framework formulated in such a way as to detect the best discriminative features without requiring the a priori setting of their number by the user and to estimate the best SVM parameters (i.e., regularization and kernel parameters) in a completely automatic way. For these purposes, it exploits fitness criteria intrinsically related to the generalization capabilities of SVM classifiers. In particular, two criteria are explored, namely: 1) the simple support vector count and 2) the radius margin bound. The effectiveness of the proposed classification system in general and of these two criteria in particular is assessed both by simulated and real experiments. In addition, a comparison with classification approaches based on three different feature selection methods is reported, i.e., the steepest ascent (SA) algorithm and two other methods explicitly developed for SVM classifiers, namely: 1) the recursive feature elimination technique and 2) the radius margin bound minimization method","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2006.880628","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1717732","Feature detection;feature selection;generalization bounds;genetic algorithms (GAs);hyperspectral image classification;sparseness;support vector machines (SVMs)","Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Hyperspectral sensors;Hyperspectral imaging;Remote sensing;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Spectroscopy;Genetics;Kernel;Minimization methods","feature extraction;genetic algorithms;geophysics computing;image classification;multidimensional signal processing;remote sensing;support vector machines","optimal SVM classification;hyperspectral remote sensing images;feature detection;feature selection;support vector machine;genetic optimization framework;simple support vector count;recursive feature elimination;radius margin bound minimization;generalization bounds;genetic algorithms;sparseness","","277","","48","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The result is called AgileEVM (agile earned value management) and is a simplified set of earned value calculations. From the values in Scrum, we derived a release date estimate using mean velocity and from this equation, generated an equivalent equation using traditional EVM techniques, thus establishing the validity of using EVM with the Scrum framework.

It could be used as a noninvasive marker in monitoring the physiological state of an individual. Currently, the primary method of deriving the HRV signal is to acquire the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, apply appropriate QRS detection algorithms to locate the R wave and its peak, find the RR intervals, and perform suitable interpolation and resampling to produce a uniformly sampled tachogram. This process could sometimes result in errors in the HRV signal due to drift, electromagnetic and biologic interference, and the complex morphology of the ECG signal. The photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal has the potential to eliminate the problems with the ECG signal to derive the HRV signal. To investigate this point, a PDA-based system was developed to simultaneously record ECG and PPG signals to facilitate accurately controlled sampling and recording durations. Two healthy young volunteers participated in this pilot study to evaluate the applicability of our approach. To improve data quality, ECG and PPG recordings were acquired three times/subject. A comparison between different features of the HRV signals derived from both methods was performed to test the validity of using PPG signals in HRV analysis. We used autoregressive (AR) modeling, Poincare' plots, cross correlation, standard deviation, arithmetic mean, skewness, kurtosis, and approximate entropy (ApEn) to derive and compare different measures from both ECG and PPG signals. This study demonstrated that our PDA-based system was a convenient and reliable means for acquisition of PPG-derived and ECG-derived HRV signals. The excellent agreement between different measures of HRV signals acquired from both methods provides potential support for the idea of using PPGs instead of ECGs in HRV signal derivation and analysis in ambulatory cardiac monitoring of healthy individuals","1557-170X","1-4244-0032-5","10.1109/IEMBS.2006.260607","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4462749","","Heart rate variability;Electrocardiography;Heart rate;Signal processing;Signal analysis;Biomedical monitoring;Detection algorithms;Interpolation;Electromagnetic interference;Morphology","autoregressive processes;correlation methods;electrocardiography;plethysmography;Poincare mapping","heart rate variability signal;electrocardiography;photoplethysmography;autonomic regulation;noninvasive marker;physiological state monitoring;ECG signal;QRS detection algorithms;tachogram;electromagnetic interference;biologic interference;autoregressive modeling;Poincare plots;cross correlation;skewness;kurtosis;approximate entropy;ambulatory cardiac monitoring","Adult;Algorithms;Computers, Handheld;Electrocardiography;Female;Heart Rate;Humans;Male;Models, Theoretical;Photoplethysmography;Pilot Projects;Reference Values;Regression Analysis;Reproducibility of Results;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","46","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The antenna is designed to serve the functions of both a radiator and a harmonics-terminated load for class-E high-efficiency power-amplifier (PA) integration. The broadband CP active antenna is realized by directly integrating the broadband CP antenna with the class-E PA. It achieves a 9% bandwidth (1.84-2.01 GHz) for axial ratio (AR) below 3 dB, and a 12% bandwidth for power-added efficiency (PAE) over 60%. To form the broadband CP active array, four active antenna elements are sequentially rotated, and each element is directly integrated with broadband class-E PA. A low-cost printed-circuit-board technology is employed in fabrication and a pseudomorphic high electron-mobility transistor is used. A peak drain efficiency of 71.5% for the class-E amplifier is measured at 1.95 GHz.

Time-lapse microscopy imaging serves as an important method to measure the cycle progression of individual cells in a large population. Since manual analysis is unreasonably time consuming for the large volumes of time-lapse image data, automated image analysis is proposed. Existing approaches dealing with time-lapse image data are rather limited and often give inaccurate analysis results, especially in segmenting and tracking individual cells in a cell population. In this paper, we present a new approach to segment and track cell nuclei in time-lapse fluorescence image sequence. First, we propose a novel marker-controlled watershed based on mathematical morphology, which can effectively segment clustered cells with less oversegmentation. To further segment undersegmented cells or to merge oversegmented cells, context information among neighboring frames is employed, which is proved to be an effective strategy. Then, we design a tracking method based on modified mean shift algorithm, in which several kernels with adaptive scale, shape, and direction are designed. Finally, we combine mean-shift and Kalman filter to achieve a more robust cell nuclei tracking method than existing ones.

The presented concept is applied to the design, fabrication, and testing of V-band (receiver (Rx): 59-61.5 GHz, transmitter (Tx): 61.5-64 GHz) transceiver front-end module using multilayer low-temperature co-fired ceramic technology. Vertically stacked 3-D low-loss cavity bandpass filters are developed for Rx and Tx channels to realize a fully integrated compact duplexer. Each filter exhibits excellent performance (Rx: IL<2.37 dB, 3-dB bandwidth (BW) /spl sim/3.5%, Tx: IL<2.39 dB, 3-dB BW /spl sim/3.33%). The fabrication tolerances contributing to the resonant frequency experimental downshift were investigated and taken into account in the simulations of the rest devices. The developed cavity filters are utilized to realize the compact duplexers by using microstrip T-junctions. This integrated duplexer shows Rx/Tx BW of 4.20% and 2.66% and insertion loss of 2.22 and 2.48 dB, respectively. The different experimental results of the duplexer compared to the individual filters above are attributed to the fabrication tolerance, especially on microstrip T-junctions. The measured channel-to-channel isolation is better than 35.2 dB across the Rx band (56-58.4 GHz) and better than 38.4 dB across the Tx band (59.3-60.9 GHz).

The filter works by injecting a matched out-of-phase copy of the TX leakage into the LNA output. It requires a reference signal coupled from the TX chain, whose I and Q components are appropriately scaled to generate the matched copy. The scale factors are the results of the correlation between the filter output signal and the I/Q components of the reference signal. The filter was designed as part of a 0.25-/spl mu/m CMOS cellular-band receiver. The effect of the DC offsets in the correlators on the TX leakage rejection ratio (TXRR) was minimized by using the sign-data variant of the LMS algorithm and by increasing the gain of the correlating multipliers. The loop stability margin was improved by swapping the I and Q reference inputs of the scaling multipliers. Without a significant group delay of the TX leakage relative to the reference signal, the filter achieved the maximum TXRR of 28 dB, which was limited by the reference signal coupling. The group delay introduced by the SAW duplexer reduced the minimum TXRR to 10.8 dB.

As the level of wind power penetration into the grid increases, the transmission system integration requirements becomes more critical. A very large wind power plant may contain hundreds of megawatt-size wind turbines. These turbines are interconnected by an intricate collector system. While the impact of individual turbines on the larger power system network is minimal, collectively, wind turbines can have a significant impact on the power systems during a severe disturbance such as a nearby fault. Since it is not practical to represent all individual wind turbines to conduct simulations, a simplified equivalent representation is required. This paper focuses on our effort to develop an equivalent representation of a wind power plant collector system for power system planning studies. The layout of the wind power plant, the size and type of conductors used, and the method of delivery (overhead or buried cables) all influence the performance of the collector system inside the wind power plant. Our effort to develop an equivalent representation of the collector system for wind power plants is an attempt to simplify power system modeling for future developments or planned expansions of wind power plants.

The criteria used by the PCA-DR and the MNF-DR are data variance and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) which are designed to measure data second-order statistics. This paper presents an independent component analysis (ICA) approach to DR, to be called ICA-DR which uses mutual information as a criterion to measure data statistical independency that exceeds second-order statistics. As a result, the ICA-DR can capture information that cannot be retained or preserved by second-order statistics-based DR techniques. In order for the ICA-DR to perform effectively, the virtual dimensionality (VD) is introduced to estimate number of dimensions needed to be retained as opposed to the energy percentage that has been used by the PCA-DR and MNF-DR to determine energies contributed by signal sources and noise. Since there is no prioritization among components generated by the ICA-DR due to the use of random initial projection vectors, we further develop criteria and algorithms to measure the significance of information contained in each of ICA-generated components for component prioritization. Finally, a comparative study and analysis is conducted among the three DR techniques, PCA-DR, MNF-DR, and ICA-DR in two applications, endmember extraction and data compression where the proposed ICA-DR has been shown to provide advantages over the PCA-DR and MNF-DR.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2005.863297","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1634722","Dimensionality reduction (DR);ICA-DR/MNF-DR;independent component analysis (ICA);maximum noise fraction (MNF);PCA-DR;principal components analysis (PCA);virtual dimensionality (VD)","Image analysis;Independent component analysis;Hyperspectral imaging;Principal component analysis;Signal to noise ratio;Noise reduction;Signal design;Statistics;Mutual information;Statistical analysis","remote sensing;image processing;geophysical signal processing;independent component analysis;higher order statistics;principal component analysis;data compression","independent component analysis;dimensionality reduction;hyperspectral image analysis;principal components analysis;maximum noise fraction;data variance;signal-to-noise ratio;second order statistics;mutual information;data statistical independency;endmember extraction;data compression","","336","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It can also be applied to images having a mixture of impulse noise and other types of noise. The result is an image quasi without (or with very little) impulse noise so that other filters can be used afterwards. This nonlinear filtering technique contains two separated steps: an impulse noise detection step and a reduction step that preserves edge sharpness. Based on the concept of fuzzy gradient values, our detection method constructs a fuzzy set impulse noise. This fuzzy set is represented by a membership function that will be used by the filtering method, which is a fuzzy averaging of neighboring pixels. Experimental results show that FIDRM provides a significant improvement on other existing filters.

In this paper, we present an information theoretic framework to quantitatively measure trust and model trust propagation in ad hoc networks. In the proposed framework, trust is a measure of uncertainty with its value represented by entropy. We develop four Axioms that address the basic understanding of trust and the rules for trust propagation. Based on these axioms, we present two trust models: entropy-based model and probability-based model, which satisfy all the axioms. Techniques of trust establishment and trust update are presented to obtain trust values from observation. The proposed trust evaluation method and trust models are employed in ad hoc networks for secure ad hoc routing and malicious node detection. A distributed scheme is designed to acquire, maintain, and update trust records associated with the behaviors of nodes' forwarding packets and the behaviors of making recommendations about other nodes. Simulations show that the proposed trust evaluation system can significantly improve the network throughput as well as effectively detect malicious behaviors in ad hoc networks.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2005.861389","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1589110","Ad hoc networks;security;trust modeling and evaluation","Ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Routing;Public key;Student members;Information security;Measurement uncertainty;Entropy;Throughput","ad hoc networks;probability;telecommunication security;routing protocols;radiowave propagation","information theoretic framework;trust propagation modeling;entropy-based model;probability;secure ad hoc routing;packet forwarding;trust evaluation","","334","","39","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It has been acknowledged that when cultural diversity is neither recognized nor acted upon, significant challenges can arise for the team. Current advice in the literature suggests that team members should adapt their normal working behavior in consideration of cultural differences. However, there is little indication of how team members should do so. This study investigated if and/or how team members adapt their behavior in cross-cultural virtual teams.

The gate drive, a self-oscillating multi-resonant circuit, dramatically reduces the gating power while ensuring fast on-off transitions of the semiconductor switch. The rectifier is a resonant topology that absorbs diode parasitic capacitance and is designed to appear resistive at the switching frequency. The small sizes of the energy storage elements (inductors and capacitors) in this circuit permit rapid start-up and shut-down and a correspondingly high control bandwidth.

Thus, constant switching frequency can be achieved under changes of state conditions. Two sliding-mode controllers based on this method are designed for positive output elementary Luo converter. Traditional small-signal analysis is applied to study the close-loop system performance under proposed approach.

Fuzzy logic can be incorporated to ontology to represent uncertainty information. Typically, fuzzy ontology is generated from a predefined concept hierarchy. However, to construct a concept hierarchy for a certain domain can be a difficult and tedious task. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes the FOGA (fuzzy ontology generation framework) for automatic generation of fuzzy ontology on uncertainty information.

"Controller design for an induction generator driven by a variable-speed wind turbine","Woei-Luen Chen; Yuan-Yih Hsu","Dept. of Electr. Eng., Nat. Taiwan Inst. of Technol., Taipei, Taiwan; NA","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","","2006","21","3","625","635","This paper presents the modeling, controller design and a steady-state analysis algorithm for a wind-driven induction generator system. An output feedback linear quadratic controller is designed for the static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) and the variable blade pitch in a wind energy conversion system (WECS) in order to reach the voltage and mechanical power control under both grid-connection and islanding conditions. A two-reference-frame model is proposed to decouple the STATCOM real and reactive power control loops for the output feedback controller. To ensure zero steady-state voltage errors for the output feedback controller, the integrals of load bus voltage deviation and dc-capacitor voltage deviation are employed as the additional state variables. Pole-placement technique is used to determine a proper weighting matrix for the linear quadratic controller such that satisfactory damping characteristics can be achieved for the closed-loop system. Effects of various system disturbances on the dynamic performance have been simulated, and the results reveal that the proposed controller is effective in regulating the load voltage and stabilizing the generator rotating speed for the WECS either connected with or disconnected from the power grid. In addition, proper steady-state operating points for an isolated induction generator can be determined by the proposed steady-state analysis algorithm. Constant output frequency control using the derived steady-state characteristics of the isolated induction generator is then demonstrated in this paper","1558-0059","","10.1109/TEC.2006.875478","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1677652","Induction generator (IG);static synchronous compensator (STATCOM);voltage regulation;wind energy conversion system (WECS);wind turbine","Induction generators;Wind turbines;Steady-state;Mechanical variables control;Algorithm design and analysis;Output feedback;Voltage control;Power system modeling;Control systems;Automatic voltage control","asynchronous generators;blades;closed loop systems;control system synthesis;damping;direct energy conversion;feedback;frequency control;linear quadratic control;machine control;matrix algebra;pole assignment;reactive power control;static VAr compensators;voltage control;wind turbines","induction generator;variable-speed wind turbine;steady-state analysis algorithm;output feedback linear quadratic controller;static synchronous compensator;STATCOM;variable blade pitch;wind energy conversion system;WECS;voltage control;mechanical power control;reference-frame model;real power control;reactive power control;output feedback controller;load bus voltage deviation;dc-capacitor voltage deviation;pole placement technique;closed-loop system;system disturbances;load voltage regulation;generator rotating speed stabilization;power grid;constant output frequency control","","67","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is difficult when the objects are often occluded for long periods: nearly all tracking algorithms will terminate a track with loss of identity on a long gap. The problem is further confounded by objects in close proximity, tracking failures due to shadows, etc. Recently, some work has been done to address these issues using higher level reasoning, by linking tracks from multiple objects over long gaps. However, these efforts have assumed a one-to-one correspondence between tracks on either side of the gap. This is often not true in real scenarios of interest, where the objects are closely spaced and dynamically occlude each other, causing trackers to merge objects into single tracks. In this paper, we show how to efficiently handle splitting and merging during track linking. Moreover, we show that we can maintain the identities of objects that merge together and subsequently split. This enables the identity of objects to be maintained throughout long sequences with difficult conditions. We demonstrate our approach on a highly challenging, oblique-view video sequence of dense traffic of a highway interchange. We successfully track the large majority of the hundreds of moving vehicles in the scene, many in close proximity, through long occlusions and shadows.","1063-6919","0-7695-2597-0","10.1109/CVPR.2006.195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1640818","","Radar tracking;Joining processes;Robustness;Automated highways;Filtering;Merging;Video sequences;Vehicles;Layout;Data security","","","","144","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is assumed that some of this replication is due to copy-and-paste activity and that a significant proportion of bugs in operating systems are due to copy-paste errors. Existing static code analyzers are either not scalable to large software suites or do not perform robustly where replicated code is modified with insertions and deletions. Furthermore, the existing tools do not detect copy-paste related bugs. In this paper, we propose a tool, CP-Miner, that uses data mining techniques to efficiently identify copy-pasted code in large software suites and detects copy-paste bugs. Specifically, it takes less than 20 minutes for CP-Miner to identify 190,000 copy-pasted segments in Linux and 150,000 in FreeBSD. Moreover, CP-Miner has detected many new bugs in popular operating systems, 49 in Linux and 31 in FreeBSD, most of which have since been confirmed by the corresponding developers and have been rectified in the following releases. In addition, we have found some interesting characteristics of copy-paste in operating system code. Specifically, we analyze the distribution of copy-pasted code by size (number lines of code), granularity (basic blocks and functions), and modification within copy-pasted code.

To mitigate the impact of compromised nodes, we propose a suite of location-based compromise-tolerant security mechanisms. Based on a new cryptographic concept called pairing, we propose the notion of location-based keys (LBKs) by binding private keys of individual nodes to both their IDs and geographic locations. We then develop an LBK-based neighborhood authentication scheme to localize the impact of compromised nodes to their vicinity. We also present efficient approaches to establish a shared key between any two network nodes. In contrast to previous key establishment solutions, our approaches feature nearly perfect resilience to node compromise, low communication and computation overhead, low memory requirements, and high network scalability. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficacy of LBKs in counteracting several notorious attacks against sensor networks such as the Sybil attack, the identity replication attack, and wormhole and sinkhole attacks. Finally, we propose a location-based threshold-endorsement scheme, called LTE, to thwart the infamous bogus data injection attack, in which adversaries inject lots of bogus data into the network.

The novel method is particularly suited for small separation between the two diplexer channels: as known, this is the most difficult case in the diplexers design, due to the strong interaction between the TX and RX filters. The proposed synthesis approach offers noticeable design flexibility, as it allows the synthesis of the two composing filters independently of their connections to the diplexer, taking into account at the same time the interaction produced in the diplexer junction. Moreover the choice of the filters topology is absolutely arbitrary (the number of poles and the transmission zeros of the two filters have to be specified).

As no fitting parameters are invoked throughout the derivation, the model is physical and predictive.

A more important issue is that, in general, association rules are mined on the entire data set without validation on an independent sample. To solve these limitations, we introduce an algorithm that uses search constraints to reduce the number of rules, searches for association rules on a training set, and finally validates them on an independent test set. The medical significance of discovered rules is evaluated with support, confidence, and lift. Association rules are applied on a real data set containing medical records of patients with heart disease. In medical terms, association rules relate heart perfusion measurements and risk factors to the degree of disease in four specific arteries. Search constraints and test set validation significantly reduce the number of association rules and produce a set of rules with high predictive accuracy. We exhibit important rules with high confidence, high lift, or both, that remain valid on the test set on several runs. These rules represent valuable medical knowledge","1558-0032","","10.1109/TITB.2006.864475","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1613959","Association rules;heart disease;search constraint;train and test","Association rules;Testing;Cardiac disease;Biomedical imaging;Medical diagnostic imaging;Heart;Arteries;Cardiovascular diseases;Data mining;Stress","blood vessels;cardiology;data mining;diseases;medical computing;medical information systems","association rule discovery;heart disease prediction;medical data set;medical records;heart perfusion measurement;risk factor;arteries;search constraint","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Decision Support Systems, Management;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Heart Diseases;Medical Records Systems, Computerized;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","74","","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Matrix games in the multicast networks: maximum information flows with network switching","Xue-Bin Liang","Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Louisiana State Univ., Baton Rouge, LA, USA","IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","","2006","52","6","2433","2466","Network coding for achieving the maximum information flow in the multicast networks has been proposed by Ahlswede, Cai, Li, and Yeung. They have demonstrated that the conventional network switching, without resort to network coding, is in general not able to achieve the optimum information flow that has been promised by network coding. A basic problem arising here is that, for a given multicast network, what is the switching gap of the network defined as the ratio of the maximum information flow in the multicast network with network coding to that only with network switching. In the paper, by considering network switching as a special form of network coding, we make a complete theoretical and computational determination of the achievable information rate region for multisource multicast network switching. The multicast networks are allowed to be cyclic or acyclic with links having arbitrary positive integer or real-valued capacity. Network switching is essentially a problem of multicast-route packing in the multicast networks. Based on this, we use the theory of games to formulate the network switching as a matrix game between the first ""player"" of links and the second ""player"" of multicast routes in the multicast networks. We prove that the maximum achievable information rate at each probabilistic direction in the information rate region is the reciprocal of the value of the corresponding game. Consequently, the maximum achievable information rate can be computed in a simple way by applying the existing theory and algorithms for the computation of the value of a matrix game, especially for such multicast networks with links all having unit capacity as the Ahlswede-Cai-Li-Yeung multicast networks. For multicast networks with links having arbitrary positive real-valued capacity, by using convex optimization, we develop a simple and efficient iterative algorithm to find the maximum achievable information rates for multisource multicast network switching. For single-source multicast networks whose links have arbitrary positive real-valued capacity, we present two max-flow min-cut theorems. The maximum information flow for single-source network switching is the minimum capacity among all soft link-cuts of the multicast network, while the maximum information flow for single-source network coding is the minimum capacity among all hard link-cuts. Consequently, by applying the theory of approximation algorithms for the set-covering problem, we demonstrate that the switching gap of a single-source multicast network is upper-bounded by the nth harmonic number Hn=1+1/2+...+1/n where n is the largest number of multicast routes containing a given link in the network. This harmonic-number bound is asymptotically tight as Oscr(ln n) for the combination multicast network. For the special class of multisource multicast networks with the same set of sink nodes, we make a comparison between the achievable information rate regions for network switching and network coding","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2006.874517","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1638538","Achievable information rate regions;game theory;matrix games;max-flow min-cut theorems;maximum information flows;multisource multicast networks;multicast routes;network coding;network switching;route packings;set-covering problems;switching gaps","Intelligent networks;Information rates;Network coding;Game theory;Computer networks;Multicast algorithms;Iterative algorithms;Decoding;Approximation algorithms;Encoding","approximation theory;encoding;game theory;iterative methods;matrix algebra;minimax techniques;multicast communication;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication switching","network coding;maximum information flow;multisource multicast network switching;real-valued capacity;multicast-route packing;game theory;matrix game;convex optimization;iterative algorithm;maximum achievable information rate;max-flow min-cut theorem;approximation algorithm;set-covering problem","","18","","43","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We use a random- coset analysis to produce an effect that is similar to output symmetry with binary channels. We show that the random selection of the nonzero elements of the GF(q) parity-check matrix induces a permutation-invariance property on the densities of the decoder messages, which simplifies their analysis and approximation. We generalize several properties, including symmetry and stability from the analysis of binary LDPC codes. We show that under a Gaussian approximation, the entire q-1-dimensional distribution of the vector messages is described by a single scalar parameter (like the distributions of binary LDPC messages). We apply this property to develop extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts for our codes. We use appropriately designed signal constellations to obtain substantial shaping gains.

Automatic determination of the most visually relevant areas would be useful in many applications such as image and video coding, watermarking, video browsing, and quality assessment. Many research groups are currently investigating computational modeling of the visual attention system. The first published computational models have been based on some basic and well-understood human visual system (HVS) properties. These models feature a single perceptual layer that simulates only one aspect of the visual system. More recent models integrate complex features of the HVS and simulate hierarchical perceptual representation of the visual input. The bottom-up mechanism is the most occurring feature found in modern models. This mechanism refers to involuntary attention (i.e., salient spatial visual features that effortlessly or involuntary attract our attention). This paper presents a coherent computational approach to the modeling of the bottom-up visual attention. This model is mainly based on the current understanding of the HVS behavior. Contrast sensitivity functions, perceptual decomposition, visual masking, and center-surround interactions are some of the features implemented in this model. The performances of this algorithm are assessed by using natural images and experimental measurements from an eye-tracking system. Two adequate well-known metrics (correlation coefficient and Kullbacl-Leibler divergence) are used to validate this model. A further metric is also defined. The results from this model are finally compared to those from a reference bottom-up model.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2006.86","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1608042","Computationally modeled human vision;bottom-up visual attention;coherent modeling;eye tracking experiments.","Computational modeling;Humans;Visual system;Layout;Feature extraction;Information filtering;Information filters;Video coding;Watermarking;Quality assessment","sensitivity;image resolution;image colour analysis","coherent computational approach;model bottom-up visual attention;visual information;human visual system;contrast sensitivity functions;perceptual decomposition;visual masking;center-surround interactions;natural images","Artificial Intelligence;Attention;Color Perception;Computer Simulation;Fixation, Ocular;Humans;Models, Neurological;Pattern Recognition, Visual;Visual Fields","385","","44","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

En route to the image's current representation, the previous JPEG compression's various settings-termed its JPEG compression history (CH)-are often discarded after the JPEG decompression step. Given a JPEG-decompressed color image, this paper aims to estimate its lost JPEG CH. We observe that the previous JPEG compression's quantization step introduces a lattice structure in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain. This paper proposes two approaches that exploit this structure to solve the JPEG Compression History Estimation (CHEst) problem. First, we design a statistical dictionary-based CHEst algorithm that tests the various CHs in a dictionary and selects the maximum a posteriori estimate. Second, for cases where the DCT coefficients closely conform to a 3-D parallelepiped lattice, we design a blind lattice-based CHEst algorithm. The blind algorithm exploits the fact that the JPEG CH is encoded in the nearly orthogonal bases for the 3-D lattice and employs novel lattice algorithms and recent results on nearly orthogonal lattice bases to estimate the CH. Both algorithms provide robust JPEG CHEst performance in practice. Simulations demonstrate that JPEG CHEst can be useful in JPEG recompression; the estimated CH allows us to recompress a JPEG-decompressed image with minimal distortion (large signal-to-noise-ratio) and simultaneously achieve a small file-size.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2005.864171","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1632192","Color;compression;history;Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG);lattice;quantization;recompression","Transform coding;Image coding;History;Color;Lattices;Discrete cosine transforms;Algorithm design and analysis;Quantization;Testing;Dictionaries","image colour analysis;image coding;data compression;discrete cosine transforms;maximum likelihood estimation","JPEG compression history estimation;digital color images;Joint Photographic Experts Group;discrete cosine transform;statistical dictionary-based algorithms;maximum a posteriori estimate;3D parallelepiped lattice","Algorithms;Color;Colorimetry;Computer Communication Networks;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Data Compression;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Models, Statistical;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","70","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing studies have found that the matching network has a significant influence on the performance of multiple antenna systems when the antennas are in close proximity. However, none has examined the wide-band case. In this paper, we investigate the wide-band performance of four different matching networks for multiple dipole antennas. The performance of the matching networks is given in terms of the bandwidths of correlation and matching efficiency, which are extensions of the single-antenna concept of bandwidth to multiple antenna systems. We also investigate the impact of the propagation conditions on the matching and bandwidth. For a uniform two-dimensional (2-D) angular power spectrum, we find that while individual-port matching can achieve in excess of 3% fractional correlation bandwidth for envelope correlation of 0.5 at an antenna separation of 0.01lambda, multiport matching is required for efficiency bandwidth to exist for a return loss of -6 dB. Moreover, even with multiport matching, both correlation and efficiency bandwidths decrease drastically at small antenna separations. At 0.01lambda, the correlation and efficiency bandwidths are 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively.

Since the BPD is usually also the only nonlinear element in the loop, in practical applications, BBPLLs are commonly analyzed by first linearizing the BPD and then using the traditional mathematical techniques for linear systems. To the author's knowledge, in the literature, the gain of the linearized BPD (Kbpd) is determined neglecting the effect of the BBPLL dynamics on the effective jitter seen by the BPD. In this brief, we develop an approach to the determination of Kbpd which takes into consideration also this effect. The approach is based on modeling the dynamics of a BBPLL as a Markov chain. This approach gives new insights into the behavior of the BBPLL and leads to an expression for the Kbpd, which is more general than the one currently known in literature","1558-3791","","10.1109/TCSII.2006.883197","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4012375","Bang-bang phase-locked loops (BBPLLs);binary phase detector (BPD);Markov chains","Phase detection;Detectors;Clocks;Jitter;Phase locked loops;Digital filters;Linear systems;Feedback loop;Sampling methods;Nonlinear systems","jitter;linearisation techniques;Markov processes;phase detectors;phase locked loops","Markov chains;bang-bang phase locked loops;binary phase detector;nonlinear systems;linear systems;jitter","","68","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The star of slots, introduced some time ago, proves itself to be again appropriate. After a brief review of the classical theory of the star of slots, its application is extended to the design of these unconventional windings.

At Phase II (backward sweep), the linear proportion concept for real and imaginary decomposition is adopted to find the ratios of real and imaginary parts of specified voltage to the calculated voltage at each upstream bus. Then, the voltage at each downstream bus is updated by real and imaginary parts of initial or calculated voltage multiplying with the corresponding ratios, respectively. The solution procedure is terminated after the mismatch of calculated voltage and specified voltage of substation is less than the tolerance value.

During the last few years, the approach has achieved growing interest—also among industrial manufacturers of mobile terminals.

The analysis of the one-dimensional (1-D) version of such a LWA excited by a line source shows that a central role in establishing the features of broadside radiation is played by the condition that the phase and attenuation constants of the leaky mode responsible for radiation are equal. When this happens, a beam with a single peak at broadside is on the verge of splitting into two distinct peaks, and maximum power density is radiated at broadside. Design formulas to achieve such an optimized condition, as well as approximate expressions for the frequency bandwidth and pattern beamwidth of the antenna and for the leaky-wave phase and attenuation constants are derived, both in the absence and in the presence of losses; in addition, an optimal-beamwidth condition (which gives the narrowest broadside beam) is derived.

Trust relations are based on evidence created by the previous interactions of entities within a protocol. In this work, we are focusing on the evaluation of trust evidence in ad hoc networks. Because of the dynamic nature of ad hoc networks, trust evidence may be uncertain and incomplete. Also, no preestablished infrastructure can be assumed. The evaluation process is modeled as a path problem on a directed graph, where nodes represent entities, and edges represent trust relations. We give intuitive requirements and discuss design issues for any trust evaluation algorithm. Using the theory of semirings, we show how two nodes can establish an indirect trust relation without previous direct interaction. We show that our semiring framework is flexible enough to express other trust models, most notably PGP's Web of Trust.

This transformer guarantees galvanic isolation between the grid and the PV system, thus providing personal protection and avoiding leakage currents between the PV system and the ground. Furthermore, it also ensures that no continuous current is injected into the grid. However, because of its low frequency (50 Hz), the transformer is big, heavy and expensive. As an alternative to the grid-connected PV systems with line transformer, new transformerless inverter topologies are being studied. If no transformer is used, a galvanic connection between the grid and the PV array exists. In these conditions, leakage currents due to the capacitance between the photovoltaic array and earth could occur and increase the electromagnetic emissions. To avoid these leakage currents, it is necessary to use inverter topologies that avoid commonmode voltages. In this paper, a new transformerless singlephase PV inverter with six IGBTs and one diode is proposed. This topology generates no common-mode voltage and has a higher efficiency than the existing topologies. The topology has been validated by simulation.","","1-4244-0121-6","10.1109/EPEPEMC.2006.4778682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4778682","","Photovoltaic systems;Solar power generation;Inverters;Topology;Leakage current;Galvanizing;Power conversion;Power system protection;Frequency;Capacitance","","","","25","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For instance, voltage quality of a power grid can be improved during a short circuit because the fault current is reduced. The interval over which voltage distortions occur, caused by a three-phase short circuit, can be limited to a few 100/spl mu/s. In contrast to this, present circuit breaker technology requires at least 100ms to clear a fault. Major drawbacks of all SCB solutions presented so far are material costs and on-state losses. Primarily because of these disadvantages, SCB systems have not been widely used yet. Consequently, new solutions should be developed which are more cost effective and offer reduced on-state losses. This paper presents a conceptual approach based on active thyristor circuits. It is proven that these topologies can lead to a wider integration of SCBs in existing grids due to the economical advantages of silicon-controlled rectifiers compared to turn-off semiconductors. After a brief introduction and a presentation of the fundamentals, different topologies are described and assessed in this paper.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2005.869756","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1603677","Silicon controlled rectifiers (SCRs);solid-state circuit breakers (SCB)","Solid state circuits;Circuit topology;Circuit breakers;Voltage;Costs;Power grids;Fault currents;Circuit faults;Thyristor circuits;Lead compounds","circuit breakers;thyristors;thyristor circuits;short-circuit currents;power supply quality","solid-state circuit breaker;active thyristor topologies;high-power semiconductors;voltage quality;fault current;voltage distortion;three-phase short circuit;silicon controlled rectifiers;active thyristor circuits","","74","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, the use of wind speed sensor to measure the wind speed adds to a system a cost and presents some difficulties in practical implementation. This paper describes the design of a buck-boost converter circuit used to achieve the maximum power control of wind turbine driven permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG). The PMSG is suitably controlled according to the generator speed and thus the power from a wind turbine settles down on the maximum power point by the proposed MPPT control method, where the wind turbine's maximum power curve and the information on wind velocity are not required","1932-5517","1-4244-0493-2","10.1109/PES.2006.1709469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1709469","Wind turbine;Variable-Speed;synchronous generator;Maximum power;Buck-boost converter","Wind turbines;Wind speed;Wind power generation;Power generation;Wind energy generation;Velocity measurement;Velocity control;Current measurement;Power measurement;Testing","angular velocity measurement;electric sensing devices;permanent magnet generators;power control;power convertors;power generation control;synchronous generators;synchronous motor drives;turbogenerators;wind turbines","DC bus control;variable speed wind turbine generation systems;buck-boost converter;peak power extraction methods;maximum power curve;wind speed measurement;wind speed sensor;maximum power control;wind turbine driven permanent magnet synchronous generator;maximum power point","","28","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper discusses various renewal energy sources available in the environment that can be tapped to supply energy for these wireless sensors. This paper has special interest on piezoelectric generator because it is simple and easy to harvest mechanical force energy from human beings as compared to other energy sources. An energy harvesting circuit design for piezoelectric pushbutton-generator is proposed and implemented efficiently for wireless radio frequency (RF) transmitter. This self-powered wireless transmitter is capable of transmitting a 12-bit digital word information using the mechanical force energy harvested from depressing the pushbutton which is attached to the energy harvesting circuit. The experimental results show that when the piezoelectric pushbutton is depressed, 67.61 muJ of electrical energy is scavenged and it is sufficient to transmit 2 complete 12-bit digital word information via the RF unit.

This condition is the indispensable starting point to implement active islanding detection methods.

Recent progress in coherent (multichannel) SAR processing raises the need for accurate registration of data takes acquired with large baseline spans, high temporal coverage, and with different frequency and/or operational modes. In this paper, we discuss a SAR image-registration procedure, based on the use of external measures which allows obtaining a very accurate alignment of SAR images. The presented technique makes use of a digital elevation model and of the precise information about the acquisition flight tracks, to compute the warping functions that map the position of each pixel in the different takes, thus avoiding any approximation. The resulting algorithm is simple, robust, precise, and very efficient; as a matter of fact, it may achieve high accuracy even in critical areas, such as steep topography regions. Moreover, the availability of an analytical and exact model allows performing a detailed sensitivity analysis that can be useful in evaluating the applicability of this technique even to future high-precision satellite systems.

To maximize their control, both attackers and defenders have migrated to low-level, operating system code. In this paper, we assume the perspective of the attacker, who is trying to run malicious software and avoid detection. By assuming this perspective, we hope to help defenders understand and defend against the threat posed by a new class of rootkits. We evaluate a new type of malicious software that gains qualitatively more control over a system. This new type of malware, which we call a virtual-machine based rootkit (VMBR), installs a virtual-machine monitor underneath an existing operating system and hoists the original operating system into a virtual machine. Virtual-machine based rootkits are hard to detect and remove because their state cannot be accessed by software running in the target system. Further, VMBRs support general-purpose malicious services by allowing such services to run in a separate operating system that is protected from the target system. We evaluate this new threat by implementing two proof-of-concept VMBRs. We use our proof-of-concept VMBRs to subvert Windows XP and Linux target systems, and we implement four example malicious services using the VMBR platform. Last, we use what we learn from our proof-of-concept VMBRs to explore ways to defend against this new threat.

It is suggested to make use of the grid-side converter as a shunt active filter in order to support the grid with power factor correction as well as harmonic compensation. A vector control scheme is used to control the grid-side converter with a priority level feature to split extra room for compensation.

In the process of population evolution, our algorithm is based on multiobjective optimization techniques, i.e., an individual in the parent population may be replaced if it is dominated by a nondominated individual in the offspring population. In addition, three models of a population-based algorithm-generator and an infeasible solution archiving and replacement mechanism are introduced. Furthermore, the simplex crossover is used as a recombination operator to enrich the exploration and exploitation abilities of the approach proposed. The new approach is tested on 13 well-known benchmark functions, and the empirical evidence suggests that it is robust, efficient, and generic when handling linear/nonlinear equality/inequality constraints. Compared with some other state-of-the-art algorithms, our algorithm remarkably outperforms them in terms of the best, mean, and worst objective function values and the standard deviations.

We propose a physically realistic model, similar to the one used in plasma physics, for the variation of the dielectric constant of water with varying frequencies and salinities. Our model is in excellent agreement with existing empirical fits for frequencies between 1 and 256 GHz. We use this model to study the propagation of electromagnetic waves in seawater.

Sequences of images from the camera are used to detect loop closure events (without reference to the internal estimates of vehicle location) using a novel appearance-based retrieval system. The loop closure detection is robust to repetitive visual structure and provides a probabilistic measure of confidence. The images suggesting loop closure are then further processed with their corresponding local laser scans to yield putative Euclidean image-image transformations. We show how naive application of this transformation to effect the loop closure can lead to catastrophic linearization errors and go on to describe a way in which gross, pre-loop closing errors can be successfully annulled. We demonstrate our system working in a challenging, outdoor setting containing substantial loops and beguiling, gently curving traversals.

In addition, the proposed learning algorithm can on-line tune parameters of dilation and translation of fuzzy wavelet basis functions and hidden-to-output weights. Therefore, a robust control law is used to eliminate uncertainties including the inevitable approximation errors resulted from the finite number of fuzzy wavelet basis functions. The proposed controller requires no prior knowledge about the dynamics of the robot and no off-line learning phase.

In this paper, a stochastic degradation modeling framework is developed for computing and continuously updating residual life distributions of partially degraded components. The proposed degradation methodology combines population-specific degradation characteristics with component-specific sensory data acquired through condition monitoring in order to compute and continuously update remaining life distributions of partially degraded components. Two sensory updating procedures are developed and validated using real-world vibration-based degradation information acquired from rolling element thrust bearings. The results are compared with two benchmark policies and illustrate the benefits of the sensory updated degradation models proposed in this paper. Note for Practitioners-The proposed degradation-based prognostic methodology provides a comprehensive assessment of the current and future degradation states of partially degraded components by combining population-specific degradation or reliability information with real-time sensory health monitoring data. It is specifically beneficial for cases where degradation occurs in a cumulative manner and the degradation signal can be approximated by an exponential functional form. To implement this methodology, it is necessary: 1) to identify the physical phenomena associated with the evolution of the degradation process (spalling and wear herein); 2) choose the appropriate condition monitoring technology to monitor this phenomena (accelerometers); 3) identify a characteristic pattern in the sensory information to help develop a degradation signal (exponential growth); and 4) identify a failure threshold associated with the degradation signal. The first step in implementing this prognostic methodology is to obtain prior information related to stochastic parameters f the exponential model. This may require fitting some sample degradation signals with an exponential functional form and noting the values of the exponential parameters, or using subjective prior distributions. The second step is to acquire sensory information and begin updating the prior distribution. The updating frequency will dictate which expressions are used to compute the posterior distributions. Once the posterior means, variances, and correlation are computed, the truncated CDF of the residual life can be evaluated using (10) and (11). Note that the truncation is necessary to preclude negative values of the remaining life. Practitioners can implement this methodology using a simple spreadsheet. Since the residual life distributions are skewed, it is reasonable to utilize the median as a measure of the central tendency and, hence, an alternative estimate for the expected value of the remaining life","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2006.876609","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1707956","Prediction methods;prognostics;reliability;stochastic processes","Degradation;Distributed computing;Condition monitoring;Intelligent sensors;Stochastic processes;Signal processing;Computer network management;Appropriate technology;Accelerometers;Fitting","condition monitoring;distributed sensors;failure analysis;intelligent sensors;maintenance engineering;reliability;remaining life assessment;rolling bearings;stochastic processes;vibrations;wear","sensory-updated residual life distributions;exponential degradation patterns;smart sensors;distributed sensor networks;critical decision making;maintenance management;stochastic degradation modeling framework;condition monitoring;remaining life distributions;partially degraded components;vibration-based degradation information;rolling element thrust bearings;degradation-based prognostic methodology;population-specific degradation;reliability information;real-time sensory health monitoring;accelerometers;degradation signal;failure threshold;posterior distributions;posterior means;posterior variances;posterior correlation;stochastic processes","","130","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

General expressions are derived that show that the method is universal with respect to the component filters, i.e., in steady-state, it performs at least as well as the best component filter. Furthermore, when the correlation between the a priori errors of the components is low enough, their combination is able to outperform both of them.

Many factors involve in designing HEVs such as fuel consumption, emission and performance. A major challenge for development of hybrid vehicles is coordination of multiple energy sources and converters, and in case of a HEV, power flow control for both mechanical and electrical path. This necessitates the utilization of appropriate control or energy management strategy. Furthermore, the durability extension of some critical components in the drive train such as batteries tends to be one of the substantial factors considered in designing control strategies for HEVs. In this paper two novel issues are considered in designing energy management systems for series HEVs. In the first part, we propose an algorithm such that the future path information of the vehicles is also taken into account for generating the control signals. Using global positioning system (GPS) installed today in most of the vehicles, such data are fed to the central vehicle controller. A fuzzy logic controller (FLC) is utilized for energy management based on the predicted future state of the vehicle, in order to improve fuel consumption, emission and performance. Then, the energy management system is modified to increase the state of the health (SOH) of the power train battery. This approach, which results in the extension of the battery life, is called predictive and protective algorithm (PPA). The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.","","0-7803-9793-2","10.1109/ICEHV.2006.352279","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4156554","Hybrid Electric Vehicle;Fuzzy Logic Controller;Global Positioning System;the State of the Health","Fuzzy control;Energy management;Hybrid electric vehicles;Predictive control;Batteries;Fuels;Load flow control;Signal generators;Global Positioning System;Centralized control","cells (electric);electric drives;energy management systems;fuel economy;fuzzy control;Global Positioning System;hybrid electric vehicles;power control;power transmission (mechanical);predictive control","fuzzy energy management;series hybrid electric vehicle;predictive control;battery durability extension;environmental issues;fuel consumption;emission;power flow control;drive train;control design;global positioning system;vehicle controller;fuzzy logic controller;vehicle performance;power train battery;battery life","","27","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A mixture model composed of a large number of Gaussians is used to represent the brain image. Each tissue is represented by a large number of Gaussian components to capture the complex tissue spatial layout. The intensity of a tissue is considered a global feature and is incorporated into the model through tying of all the related Gaussian parameters. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is utilized to learn the parameter-tied, constrained Gaussian mixture model. An elaborate initialization scheme is suggested to link the set of Gaussians per tissue type, such that each Gaussian in the set has similar intensity characteristics with minimal overlapping spatial supports. Segmentation of the brain image is achieved by the affiliation of each voxel to the component of the model that maximized the a posteriori probability. The presented algorithm is used to segment three-dimensional, T1-weighted, simulated and real MR images of the brain into three different tissues, under varying noise conditions. Results are compared with state-of-the-art algorithms in the literature. The algorithm does not use an atlas for initialization or parameter learning.

This current mismatch of the CP in the PLL generates fluctuations in the voltage-controlled-oscillator input and subsequently, a large phase noise on the PLL output signals. In this brief, a new CP with good current matching characteristics is proposed.

We define the difference between two histograms to be a temperature field. We then study the relationship between histogram similarity and a diffusion process, showing how diffusion handles deformation as well as quantization effects. As a result, the diffusion distance is derived as the sum of dissimilarities over scales. Being a cross-bin histogram distance, the diffusion distance is robust to deformation, lighting change and noise in histogram-based local descriptors. In addition, it enjoys linear computational complexity which significantly improves previously proposed cross-bin distances with quadratic complexity or higher. We tested the proposed approach on both shape recognition and interest point matching tasks using several multi-dimensional histogram-based descriptors including shape context, SIFT, and spin images. In all experiments, the diffusion distance performs excellently in both accuracy and efficiency in comparison with other state-of-the-art distance measures.

In the early stage of an attack, however, these changes are hard to detect and difficult to distinguish from usual traffic fluctuations. Rapid response, a minimal false-alarm rate, and the capability to detect a wide spectrum of attacks are the crucial features of intrusion detection systems. In this paper, we develop efficient adaptive sequential and batch-sequential methods for an early detection of attacks that lead to changes in network traffic, such as denial-of-service attacks, worm-based attacks, port-scanning, and man-in-the-middle attacks. These methods employ a statistical analysis of data from multiple layers of the network protocol to detect very subtle traffic changes. The algorithms are based on change-point detection theory and utilize a thresholding of test statistics to achieve a fixed rate of false alarms while allowing us to detect changes in statistical models as soon as possible. There are three attractive features of the proposed approach. First, the developed algorithms are self-learning, which enables them to adapt to various network loads and usage patterns. Secondly, they allow for the detection of attacks with a small average delay for a given false-alarm rate. Thirdly, they are computationally simple and thus can be implemented online. Theoretical frameworks for detection procedures are presented.

To better understand how developers gain this understanding and how software development environments might be involved, a study was performed in which developers were given an unfamiliar program and asked to work on two debugging tasks and three enhancement tasks for 70 minutes. The study found that developers interleaved three activities. They began by searching for relevant code both manually and using search tools; however, they based their searches on limited and misrepresentative cues in the code, environment, and executing program, often leading to failed searches. When developers found relevant code, they followed its incoming and outgoing dependencies, often returning to it and navigating its other dependencies; while doing so, however, Eclipse's navigational tools caused significant overhead. Developers collected code and other information that they believed would be necessary to edit, duplicate, or otherwise refer to later by encoding it in the interactive state of Eclipse's package explorer, file tabs, and scroll bars. However, developers lost track of relevant code as these interfaces were used for other tasks, and developers were forced to find it again. These issues caused developers to spend, on average, 35 percent of their time performing the mechanics of navigation within and between source files. These observations suggest a new model of program understanding grounded in theories of information foraging and suggest ideas for tools that help developers seek, relate, and collect information in a more effective and explicit manner","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2006.116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4016573","Program investigation;program understanding;program comprehension;empirical software engineering;information foraging;information scent.","Software maintenance;Programming;Navigation;Software engineering;Software tools;Performance gain;Debugging;Encoding;Packaging;Bars","program debugging;software maintenance","software maintenance tasks;software development environment;debugging task;search tool;Eclipse package explorer;file tabs;scroll bars;source files;program understanding;information foraging","","269","","51","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While it is often assumed that the receiver (whether base station or mobile) needs to know the channel for accurate power control, scheduling, and data demodulation, it is now known that the transmitter (especially the base station) can also benefit greatly from this information. For example, recent results in multiantenna multiuser systems show that large throughput gains are possible when the base station uses multiple antennas and a known channel to transmit distinct messages simultaneously and selectively to many single-antenna users. In time-division duplex systems, where the base station and mobiles share the same frequency band for transmission, the base station can exploit reciprocity to obtain the forward channel from pilots received over the reverse channel. Frequency-division duplex systems are more difficult because the base station transmits and receives on different frequencies and therefore cannot use the received pilot to infer anything about the multiantenna transmit channel. Nevertheless, we show that the time occupied in frequency-duplex CSI transfer is generally less than one might expect and falls as the number of antennas increases. Thus, although the total amount of channel information increases with the number of antennas at the base station, the burden of learning this information at the base station paradoxically decreases. Thus, the advantages of having more antennas at the base station extend from having network gains to learning the channel information. We quantify our gains using linear analog modulation which avoids digitizing and coding the CSI and therefore can convey information very rapidly and can be readily analyzed. The old paradigm that it is not worth the effort to learn channel information at the transmitter should be revisited since the effort decreases and the gain increases with the number of antennas.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2006.870543","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1608543","Analog modulation;broadcast channels;channel state information (CSI);frequency-division duplex;wireless communications","Channel state information;Base stations;Frequency;Transmitters;Transmitting antennas;Wireless communication;Power control;Demodulation;Throughput;Gain","wireless channels;radio transmitters;mobile radio;antenna arrays;modulation","channel state information;wireless systems;wireless communication systems;time-division duplex systems;frequency-division duplex systems;base station;multiantenna transmit channel","","167","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed testing paradigm tests to see if a software product exhibits proper behavior when subject to improper usage or improper input. For lack of a more descriptive name and in compliance with similar testing performed on hardware systems, the new paradigm is called ""destructive testing"". As presented in this paper, destructive testing does not replace conventional testing, rather destructive testing supplements conventional testing (calls for additional testing beyond conventional testing). The paper discusses other uses of the term ""destructive testing"" as applied to software systems. Conventional testing techniques are ranked based on applicability to destructive testing. Techniques of incorporating destructive testing requirements into the SRS are proposed, the need and rational for destructive testing is discussed, and ongoing and future work in destructive testing is outlined","","0-7695-2613-6","10.1109/ICIS-COMSAR.2006.83","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1652020","software;engineering;testing;destructive","Software testing;System testing;Performance evaluation;Automobiles;Software performance;Hardware;Information science;Robustness;Software quality;Accidents","formal specification;program testing","destructive software testing;software requirement specifications;software product behavior;hardware systems","","1","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite a wealth of normative and prescriptive writings about what roles CIOs should play in contemporary firms, there has been limited empirical research on the above two questions. This study addresses the above questions, particularly with respect to the effectiveness of the CIOs in the healthcare sector. Based on survey data from CIOs and members of the TMTs, we find that there are six salient CIO roles: business strategist, integrator, relationship architect, utility provider, information steward, and educator. Further, CIO capabilities, in the form of business and strategic information technology knowledge, political savvy, and interpersonal communication makes CIOs effective, particularly in the roles of business strategist, integrator, and relationship architect. High levels of engagements between the CIOs and TMTs do not directly impact CIO's role effectiveness, but are mediated by the effects of CIO capabilities.

The gap between average and peak power actually widens with increased levels of core integration. As such, if per-core control of power levels (modes) is possible, a global power manager should be able to dynamically set the modes suitably. This would be done in tune with the workload characteristics, in order to always maintain a chip-level power that is below the specified budget. Furthermore, this should be possible without significant degradation of chip-level throughput performance. We analyze and validate this concept in detail in this paper. We assume a per-core DVFS (dynamic voltage and frequency scaling) knob to be available to such a conceptual global power manager. We evaluate several different policies for global multi-core power management. In this analysis, we consider various different objectives such as prioritization and optimized throughput. Overall, our results show that in the context of a workload comprised of SPEC benchmark threads, our best architected policies can come within 1% of the performance of an ideal oracle, while meeting a given chip-level power budget.

The proposed relaxed forms of the NMF algorithms have a higher convergence speed with the desired constraints. Moreover, the effects of various regularization and constraints are clearly shown.

Eng., Nanyang Technol. Univ., Singapore; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","","2006","53","5","1603","1611","The dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) provides a technically advanced and economical solution to voltage-sag problem. As the voltage-restoration process involves real-power injection into the distribution system, the capability of a particular DVR topology, especially for compensating long-duration voltage sags, depends on the energy storage capacity of the DVR. The interline DVR (IDVR) proposed in this paper provides a way to replenish dc-link energy storage dynamically. The IDVR consists of several DVRs connected to different distribution feeders in the power system. The DVRs in the IDVR system share a common energy storage. When one of the DVR compensates for voltage sag appearing in that feeder, the other DVRs replenish the energy in the common dc-link dynamically. Thus, one DVR in the IDVR system works in voltage-sag compensation mode while the other DVRs in the IDVR system operate in power-flow control mode. In principle, IDVR can operate effectively when constituent DVRs are electrically (not necessarily physically) far apart. Closed-loop load voltage and current-mode-control techniques are used as the control strategy in the two modes of operation. Experimental results obtained for a laboratory prototype of the IDVR are presented to show the effectiveness and the efficacy of the proposed IDVR system to improve power quality","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2006.882017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1705652","Current-mode control;dynamic voltage restorer (DVR);interline dynamic voltage restoration;phase advance;power quality","Power quality;Energy storage;Voltage fluctuations;Voltage control;Power generation economics;Topology;Power system dynamics;Power systems;Control systems;Laboratories","closed loop systems;compensation;electric current control;energy storage;load flow control;power distribution control;power supply quality;power system restoration;voltage control","voltage sag compensation;multiline distribution system;interline dynamic voltage restorer;voltage-restoration process;real-power injection;energy storage capacity;distribution feeders;power-flow control mode;closed-loop load voltage control;current-mode-control;power quality","","83","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The adhesion of the two wafers occurs due to attractive long range van der Waals or hydrogen bonding forces. At room temperature the bonding energy of the interface is low and higher temperature annealing of the bonded wafer pairs has to be carried out to enhance the bonding energy. In this paper, we describe the prerequisites for the wafer-bonding process to occur and the methods to prepare the suitable surfaces for wafer bonding. The characterization techniques to assess the quality of the bonded interfaces and to measure the bonding energy are presented. Next, the applications of wafer direct bonding in the fabrication of novel engineered substrates such as ""silicon-on-insulator"" and other ""on-insulator"" substrates are detailed. These novel substrates, often called hybrid substrates, are fabricated using wafer bonding and layer splitting via a high dose hydrogen/helium implantation and subsequent annealing. The specifics of this process, also known as the smart-cut process, are introduced.

The DCO is part of a single-chip fully compliant quad-band GSM transceiver realized in a 90-nm digital CMOS process. By operating the DCO at a 4 /spl times/ GSM low-band frequency followed by frequency dividers, the requirement of on-chip inductor Q and the amount of gate oxide stress are relaxed. It was found that a dynamic divider is needed for stringent TX output phase noise while a source-coupled-logic divider can be used for RX to save power. Both dividers are capable of producing a tight relation between four quadrature output phases at low voltage and low power. Frequency tuning is achieved through digital control of the varactors which serve as an RF DAC. Combining a MIM capacitor array and two nMOS transistor arrays of the varactors for the RF DAC, a highly linear oscillator gain which is also insensitive to process shift is achieved. The finest varactor step size is 12 kHz at the 1.6-2.0 GHz output. With a sigma-delta dithering, high frequency resolution is obtained while having negligible phase noise degradation. The measured phase noise of -167 dBc/Hz at 20 MHz offset from 915 MHz carrier and frequency tuning range of 24.5% proves that this DCO system can be used in SAW-less quad-band transmitters for mobile phones.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2006.872739","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1624406","Cellular phone;channel hot carrier (CHC);deep-submicron CMOS;digitally controlled oscillator (DCO);electromigration (EM);gate-oxide reliability;GSM;mobile phone;quantization noise;sigma-delta modulator;varactor;voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)","Digital control;Control systems;Oscillators;Transmitters;Telephone sets;Phase noise;Frequency;Varactors;Mobile handsets;GSM","UHF oscillators;radio transmitters;mobile handsets;cellular radio;CMOS integrated circuits;frequency dividers;MIM devices;digital-analogue conversion;varactors;phase noise","digital controlled oscillator system;cellular handsets;mobile phones;quad-band GSM transceiver;digital CMOS process;frequency dividers;on-chip inductor;gate oxide stress;quadrature output phase;digital varactor control;MIM capacitor array;nMOS transistor arrays;sigma-delta dithering;high frequency resolution;SAW-less quad-band transmitters;1.6 to 2.0 GHz;12 kHz;20 MHz;915 MHz;90 nm","","55","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These measured data included axial compression and azimuthal interleaving of adjacent projections. Measured data were corrected for crystal and geometrical efficiency. Then, a whole system matrix was derived by processing the responses in projection space. Such responses included both geometrical and detection physics components of the system matrix. The response was parameterized to correct for point source location and to smooth for projection noise. The model also accounts for axial compression (span) used on the scanner. The forward projector for iterative reconstruction was constructed using the estimated response parameters. This paper extends our previous work to fully three-dimensional.

A novel scheme of actuation by Curie-thermoregulated inductive heating is presented. Prototype medical devices made from SMP loaded with nickel zinc ferrite ferromagnetic particles were actuated in air by applying an alternating magnetic field to induce heating. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis was performed on both the particle-loaded and neat SMP materials to assess the impact of the ferrite particles on the mechanical properties of the samples. Calorimetry was used to quantify the rate of heat generation as a function of particle size and volumetric loading of ferrite particles in the SMP. These tests demonstrated the feasibility of SMP actuation by inductive heating. Rapid and uniform heating was achieved in complex device geometries and particle loading up to 10% volume content did not interfere with the shape recovery of the SMP","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2006.877113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1703759","Curie temperature;inductive heating magnetic particle;medical device;shape memory polymer (SMP)","Shape;Polymers;Magnetic devices;Heating;Ferrites;Geometry;Microactuators;In vivo;Prototypes;Nickel","biomedical equipment;calorimetry;Curie temperature;ferrites;ferromagnetic materials;filled polymers;heating;nickel compounds;particle reinforced composites;particle size;shape memory effects;zinc compounds","inductively heated shape memory polymer;magnetic actuation;medical devices;expandable stents;intravascular microactuators;Curie-thermoregulated inductive heating;nickel zinc ferrite ferromagnetic particles;dynamic mechanical thermal analysis;calorimetry;heat generation;particle size;particle loading","Biocompatible Materials;Biocompatible Materials;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Equipment and Supplies;Hot Temperature;Magnetics;Materials Testing;Polymers;Polymers","227","","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The heartbeat classification system processes an incoming recording with a global-classifier to produce the first set of beat annotations. An expert then validates and if necessary corrects a fraction of the beats of the recording. The system then adapts by first training a local-classifier using the newly annotated beats and combines this with the global-classifier to produce an adapted classification system. The adapted system is then used to update beat annotations.

Due to severe indoor multipath conditions, these techniques often suffer from significant inaccuracy in location estimation. In this paper, we introduce a model for the error in estimated distance as measured from the estimated TOA of the direct path (DP) in a typical multipath indoor environment. The TOA estimation error has two components, (1) the errors caused by the multipath dispersion affecting any signal path and (2) the errors caused by undetected direct path (UDP) conditions. The statistical behavior of this error is also a function of the system bandwidth. The empirical data from UWB indoor measurements in an office building are used to design a model for the distance measurement error.

Hence, it does save energy which is conventionally wasted by a braking resistor. Moreover, the large engine generator is replaced by the much smaller one, because the supercapacitor reduces high power demands away from it. For the power conversion between the supercapacitor and the dc link, a three-leg bidirectional dc-dc converter, which has the same structure as the commercially available three-phase inverter, is used. Two kinds of simulations are performed to study the behaviors of the proposed system under the worst operating conditions.

We first restrict the link schedules to the class of interference-free time division multiple access (TDMA) schedules. In this special case, we formulate the optimization problem as a mixed integerconvex program, which can be solved using standard techniques. Moreover, when the slots lengths are variable, the optimization problem is convex and can be solved efficiently and exactly using interior point methods. For general non-orthogonal link schedules, we propose an iterative algorithm that alternates between adaptive link scheduling and computation of optimal link rates and transmission powers for a fixed link schedule. The performance of this algorithm is compared to other design approaches for several network topologies.

Gesture sequences often have a complex underlying structure, and models that can incorporate hidden structures have proven to be advantageous for recognition tasks. Most existing approaches to gesture recognition with hidden states employ a Hidden Markov Model or suitable variant (e.g., a factored or coupled state model) to model gesture streams; a significant limitation of these models is the requirement of conditional independence of observations. In addition, hidden states in a generative model are selected to maximize the likelihood of generating all the examples of a given gesture class, which is not necessarily optimal for discriminating the gesture class against other gestures. Previous discriminative approaches to gesture sequence recognition have shown promising results, but have not incorporated hidden states nor addressed the problem of predicting the label of an entire sequence. In this paper, we derive a discriminative sequence model with a hidden state structure, and demonstrate its utility both in a detection and in a multi-way classification formulation. We evaluate our method on the task of recognizing human arm and head gestures, and compare the performance of our method to both generative hidden state and discriminative fully-observable models.","1063-6919","0-7695-2597-0","10.1109/CVPR.2006.132","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1640937","","Hidden Markov models;Pattern recognition;Humans;Computer vision;State estimation;Computer science;Artificial intelligence;Laboratories;Application software;Power generation","","","","72","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, more basic research is needed to increase the range and reliability of a passive RF tag's radio link, particularly when the RF tag is placed onto any lossy dielectric or metallic surface. This paper presents two new useful forms of the radio link budget that describe the power link of an RF tag system when the tag is attached to an object. These radio link budgets are dependent upon the gain penalty, a term which quantifies the reduction in RF tag antenna gain due to material attachment. A series of measurements, or radio assay, was used to measure the far-field gain pattern and gain penalty of several flexible 915 MHz antennas when attached to cardboard, pine plywood, acrylic, deionized water, ethylene glycol, ground beef, and an aluminum slab. It is shown that the gain penalty due to material attachment can result in more than 20 dB of excess loss in the backscatter communication link.","1548-5757","","10.1109/LAWP.2006.874072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1643635","Antenna gain patterns;antenna measurements;link budget;material properties;radio frequency identification (RFID);radio frequency (RF) tag","Radio frequency;Radio link;Radiofrequency identification;Dielectric losses;Antenna measurements;Gain measurement;Microwave bands;Power system reliability;Anti-freeze;Aluminum","radiofrequency identification;antenna radiation patterns;UHF antennas;radio links","RF tag antenna performance;radio links budgets;passive radio frequency tags;UHF bands;microwave bands;radiofrequency identification;RFID;radio assay;far-field gain pattern;gain penalty;cardboard;pine plywood;acrylic;deionized water;ethylene glycol;ground beef;aluminum slab;material attachment;antenna gain patterns;915 MHz","","131","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The new approach is termed independent vector analysis (IVA). In the model, we assume that linear mixing model exists in each dimension separately, and the latent sources are independent of the others. In contrast to ICA, the sources are random vectors, not just single variables, which means the elements of a random vector are closely related to the others. Thus, we assume the dependency between the elements of a source vector. In this manner, we define dependence between vectors as Kullback-Leibler divergence between the total joint probability of vectors and the product of marginal probabilities of vectors. Then, the model allows independence between multivariate source signals represented as random vectors, and dependence between the source signals within the vector representation. The proposed vector density model can for example capture variance dependencies within a vector source signal. There are several applications of this new formulation. In the separation of acoustic sources, the algorithm mitigates the permutation problem, i.e. the usual ICA algorithms applied in to the frequency domain mixture data suffer from the unknown permutation of the output signals. Although there are several engineering solutions to fix this problem after the ICA stage, the proposed method provides a natural solution to the problem by capturing the inherent dependencies of the acoustic signals. It therefore avoids the permutation problem and allows the separation of sources in very challenging environments for many sound sources.","1058-6393","1-4244-0784-2","10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354986","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4176796","","Algorithm design and analysis;Independent component analysis;Vectors;Source separation;Signal processing algorithms;Blind source separation;Multidimensional systems;Time frequency analysis;Color;Stock markets","acoustic signal processing;frequency-domain analysis;independent component analysis;signal representation;source separation","independent vector analysis;independent component analysis;ICA algorithm;univariate source signals;multivariate source signals;linear mixing model;latent sources;random vectors;Kullback-Leibler divergence;joint probability;marginal probability;vector representation;vector density model;acoustic sources;permutation problem;frequency domain mixture;acoustic signals","","34","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The input impedances of three basic PWM dc-to-dc converters (buck, boost, and buck/boost converter) with either voltage-mode control or current-mode control are derived using Middlebrook's extra element theorem and feedback theorem, and subsequently simplified into approximations using the graphical Bode plot analysis method. Analytical expressions for 24 input impedances are provided in a factorized time-constant form, thereby providing a comprehensive reference for dynamic interaction analyses requiring knowledge of converters' input impedances.

The control loops are devised and analyzed taking into account the special nature of a low voltage microgrid, in which the line impedance is mainly resistive and the distance between the inverters makes the control intercommunication between them difficult. In contrast with the conventional droop control method, the proposed controller uses resistive output impedance, and as a result a different control law is obtained. The controller is implemented by using a DSP board, which only uses local measurements of the unit, thus increasing the modularity, reliability, and flexibility of the distributed system.

In contrast to the already established flap-control system, which controls the access of (combustion) gases from outside the vehicle to the car cabin, the system studied here detects odor events created within the car cabin. The events under study have been cigarette smoke, fast-food odor, manure, and bioeffluents (flatulence). As the reference cannot be a ""simple analytical measurement,"" a human test panel for assessing the hedonic impression on a scale from 0 to 5 is used as reference. The technical system is a MEMS metal-oxide-sensor array consisting of three different sensors. The data-evaluation approach used here is combining the human-sensory data and the MEMS sensor data. The task is performed by the combination of two independent algorithms, where one is related to the normalized conductance and the other to signal variance. Using a combined approach has the advantage that ""false"" events are suppressed. After the algorithm was successfully transferred onto a microcontroller, real-life data were recorded and classified.

However, due to the necessity to capture, record, process, and display an enormous amount of optical data for producing high-quality 3-D images, the developed 3-D imaging techniques were forced to compromise their performances (e.g., gave up the continuous parallax, restricting to a fixed viewing point) or to use special devices and technology (such as coherent illuminations, special spectacles) which is inconvenient for most practical implementation. Today's rapid progress of digital capture and display technology opened the possibility to proceed toward noncompromising, easy-to-use 3-D imaging techniques. This technology progress prompted the revival of the integral imaging (II)technique based on a technique proposed almost one century ago. II is a type of multiview 3-D imaging system that uses an array of diffractive or refractive elements to capture the 3-D optical data. It has attracted great attention recently, since it produces autostereoscopic images without special illumination requirements. However, with a conventional II system it is not possible to produce 3-D images that have both high resolution, large depth-of-field, and large viewing angle. This paper provides an overview of the approaches and techniques developed during the last decade to overcome these limitations. By combining these techniques with upcoming technology it is to be expected that II-based 3-D imaging systems will reach practical applicability in various fields.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2006.870696","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1605205","Computer-generated integral imaging (CGII);computational integral imaging (CII);integral imaging (II);three-dimensional (3-D) imaging","Optical imaging;Optical refraction;Optical sensors;Lighting;High-resolution imaging;Optical arrays;Data visualization;Three dimensional displays;Optical devices;Optical recording","three-dimensional displays;optical information processing;image sensors;optical images;stereo image processing;diffractive optical elements","3D image sensing;image visualization;image processing;3D display technology;3D imaging technique;digital capture;integral imaging technique;multiview 3D imaging system;3D optical data;autostereoscopic image;computer-generated integral imaging;computational integral imaging","","262","","84","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The state of the controller is reset to guarantee the stability requirement of the Lyapunov function when the switching event occurs. Two parameter-dependent switching logics, hysteresis switching and switching with average dwell time, are examined.

The performance tradeoffs that come along with different parameterizations are investigated by means of stochastic simulations on three dangerous traffic situations, namely 1) rear-end collisions due to an unexpected braking, 2) cutting-in vehicles, and 3) crossing traffic at intersections. The results show that an overly conservative CM system sacrifices much of its potential benefit.

"A Novel Transductive SVM for Semisupervised Classification of Remote-Sensing Images","L. Bruzzone; M. Chi; M.

The method is based on recent developments in statistical learning theory concerning transductive inference and in particular transductive SVMs (TSVMs). TSVMs exploit specific iterative algorithms which gradually search a reliable separating hyperplane (in the kernel space) with a transductive process that incorporates both labeled and unlabeled samples in the training phase. Based on an analysis of the properties of the TSVMs presented in the literature, a novel modified TSVM classifier designed for addressing ill-posed remote-sensing problems is proposed. In particular, the proposed technique: 1) is based on a novel transductive procedure that exploits a weighting strategy for unlabeled patterns, based on a time-dependent criterion; 2) is able to mitigate the effects of suboptimal model selection (which is unavoidable in the presence of small-size training sets); and 3) can address multiclass cases.

There are two different approaches for generating white light with LEDs. The first one is the combination of phosphors excited by blue or UV LED emission, the other one is mixture of multi-color LEDs Without the power loss in the down conversion process of the white LED using phosphors, a higher efficiency and flexible option can be done with the mixture of multi-color LEDs. Questions arise on how the spectra of the mixture of colored LED designed are for good color rendering performance, more output lumens and better luminous efficiency. A lot of papers discuss the different spectrum combinations of multicolored LEDs which yield light with maximum efficacy, luminous flux and CRI, at the desired corrected color temperature, but most of them use the spectral power distribution of a model LED to calculate the luminous efficacy, luminous flux and CRI, and get the best combination as request. But as most people know, the spectral power distribution of a real LED will vary with ambient temperature, forward current and effect of aging, so simulation of the luminous efficacy, luminous flux and CRI will get some problems in practical. On the other hand, the finding of a better luminous efficacy of the mixture of colored LED can provide the best suggestion when the LED manufacturers try to select commercial LED chips to manufacture colored LED light sources. We setup a system with integrating sphere, spectrometer and four independent PC controlled powermeters, which can get the data of luminous flux, CRI and luminous efficiency of light sources automatically with different input power. Using the database from the system and simulations, we can analyze the optical and color characteristics of the mixture of colored LED light source, even the RGB LED (red, green and blue chips in one package). Then the selection of the combination of the LED chips for the mixture of colored LED light source, for generating more luminous flux, better color rendering index and luminous efficiency should be good.","","978-1-4244-0833-7","10.1109/EMAP.2006.4430677","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4430677","","Light emitting diodes;Light sources;Phosphors;Color;Temperature distribution;Power distribution;Manufacturing;Energy consumption;Lighting;Aging","colorimetry;integrated optoelectronics;light emitting diodes;light sources;phosphors;photometry","colored LED light sources;illumination applications;UV LED emission;down conversion process;white LED;phosphors;luminous flux;spectral power distribution;integrating sphere;spectrometer;PC controlled powermeters;optical characteristics;color characteristics;color rendering index;luminous efficiency","","17","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among those schemes, OFDMA and DFT-S OFDM are both promising for their special advantages for uplink. In this paper, the link level performance of MA schemes are compared. The simulation results show that without coding, OFDMA has 1 dB performance gain than DFT-S OFDM when BER is equal to 10-2. When turbo coding is adopted, OFDMA has near 3 dB performance gain than DFT-S OFDM when BLER is equal to 10-2. The performance difference between OFDMA and DFT-S OFDM is increased for MIMO system. Since the PAPR can be reduced to lower than 6 dB as required by 3GPP, OFDMA has the performance gain than DFT-S OFDM in link level simulation.","","1-4244-0462-2","10.1109/CHINACOM.2006.344649","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4149902","","OFDM;Performance gain;Multiaccess communication;Frequency conversion;Long Term Evolution;Frequency division multiaccess;Bit error rate;Turbo codes;MIMO;Peak to average power ratio","3G mobile communication;code division multiple access;discrete Fourier transforms;error statistics;frequency division multiple access;MIMO communication;turbo codes","OFDMA;SC-FDMA;link level performance;3G long term evolution;3GPP;multiple access schemes;MC-time duplex-synchronized CDMA;orthogonal frequency division multiple access;interleaved FDMA;DFT-S OFDM;BER;turbo coding;MIMO system","","22","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The design of the device includes the following features: 1) it is passive, i.e., it does not include motors or actuators, but is only composed of links and springs; 2) it is safe and has a simple patient-machine interface to accommodate variability in geometry and inertia of the subjects. A number of methods have been proposed in the literature to gravity-balance a machine. Here, we use a hybrid method to achieve gravity balancing of a human leg over its range of motion. In the hybrid method, a mechanism is used to first locate the center of mass of the human limb and the orthosis. Springs are then added so that the system is gravity-balanced in every configuration. For a quantitative evaluation of the performance of the device, electromyographic (EMG) data of the key muscles, involved in the motion of the leg, were collected and analyzed. Further experiments involving leg-raising and walking tasks were performed, where data from encoders and force-torque sensors were used to compute joint torques. These experiments were performed on five healthy subjects and a stroke patient. The results showed that the EMG activity from the rectus femoris and hamstring muscles with the device was reduced by 75%, during static hip and knee flexion, respectively. For leg-raising tasks, the average torque for static positioning was reduced by 66.8% at the hip joint and 47.3% at the knee joint; however, if we include the transient portion of the leg-raising task, the average torque at the hip was reduced by 61.3%, and at the knee was increased by 2.7% at the knee joints. In the walking experiment, there was a positive impact on the range of movement at the hip and knee joints, especially for the stroke patient: the range of movement increased by 45% at the hip joint and by 85% at the knee joint.

A major problem is spatially-varying reduction of contrast by stray radiance (airlight), which is scattered by the haze particles towards the camera. Recent computer vision methods have shown that images can be compensated for haze, and even yield a depth map of the scene. A key step in such a scene recovery is subtraction of the airlight. In particular, this can be achieved by analyzing polarization-filtered images. However, the recovery requires parameters of the airlight. These parameters were estimated in past studies by measuring pixels in sky areas. This paper derives an approach for blindly recovering the parameter needed for separating the airlight from the measurements, thus recovering contrast, with neither user interaction nor existence of the sky in the frame. This eases the interaction and conditions needed for image dehazing, which also requires compensation for attenuation. The approach has proved successful in experiments, some of which are shown here.","1063-6919","0-7695-2597-0","10.1109/CVPR.2006.71","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1640996","","Independent component analysis;Layout;Image analysis;Particle scattering;Computer vision;Polarization;Parameter estimation;Light scattering;Degradation;Reflection","","","","239","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sharma","NA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","","2006","8","3","500","508","This paper presents a spatio-temporal approach in recognizing six universal facial expressions from visual data and using them to compute levels of interest. The classification approach relies on a two-step strategy on the top of projected facial motion vectors obtained from video sequences of facial expressions. First a linear classification bank was applied on projected optical flow vectors and decisions made by the linear classifiers were coalesced to produce a characteristic signature for each universal facial expression. The signatures thus computed from the training data set were used to train discrete hidden Markov models (HMMs) to learn the underlying model for each facial expression. The performances of the proposed facial expressions recognition were computed using five fold cross-validation on Cohn-Kanade facial expressions database consisting of 488 video sequences that includes 97 subjects. The proposed approach achieved an average recognition rate of 90.9% on Cohn-Kanade facial expressions database. Recognized facial expressions were mapped to levels of interest using the affect space and the intensity of motion around apex frame. Computed level of interest was subjectively analyzed and was found to be consistent with ""ground truth"" information in most of the cases. To further illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, and also to better understand the effects of a number of factors that are detrimental to the facial expression recognition, a number of experiments were conducted. The first empirical analysis was conducted on a database consisting of 108 facial expressions collected from TV broadcasts and labeled by human coders for subsequent analysis. The second experiment (emotion elicitation) was conducted on facial expressions obtained from 21 subjects by showing the subjects six different movies clips chosen in a manner to arouse spontaneous emotional reactions that would produce natural facial expressions.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2006.870737","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1632035","Emotions;face detection;hidden Markov models (HMMs);levels of interest;machine learning;universal facial expressions","Face recognition;Hidden Markov models;Databases;Vectors;Video sequences;Image motion analysis;Training data;Information analysis;TV broadcasting;Humans","face recognition;emotion recognition;image sequences;image motion analysis;pattern classification;hidden Markov models;visual databases;learning (artificial intelligence)","universal facial expression recognition;levels of interest measurement;video sequences;spatio-temporal approach;facial motion vector projection;linear classification bank;optical flow vector projection;discrete hidden Markov model training;HMM;Cohn-Kanade facial expressions database;empirical analysis","","143","","64","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is in the network designer's best interest to have each node transmit at the lowest possible power while preserving network connectivity. In this paper, we investigate the optimal common transmit power, defined as the minimum transmit power used by all nodes necessary to guarantee network connectivity. This is desirable in sensor networks where nodes are relatively simple and it is difficult to modify the transmit power after deployment. The optimal transmit power derived in this paper is subject to the specific routing and medium access control (MAC) protocols considered; however, the approach can be extended to other routing and MAC protocols as well. In deriving the optimal transmit power, we distinguish ourselves from a conventional graph-theoretic approach by taking realistic physical layer characteristics into consideration.

"Tuning the structure and parameters of a neural network by using hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm","Jinn-Tsong Tsai; Jyh-Horng Chou; Tung-Kuan Liu","Dept. of Med. Inf. Manage., Kaohsiung Med. Univ., Taiwan; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","","2006","17","1","69","80","In this paper, a hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm (HTGA) is applied to solve the problem of tuning both network structure and parameters of a feedforward neural network. The HTGA approach is a method of combining the traditional genetic algorithm (TGA), which has a powerful global exploration capability, with the Taguchi method, which can exploit the optimum offspring. The Taguchi method is inserted between crossover and mutation operations of a TGA. Then, the systematic reasoning ability of the Taguchi method is incorporated in the crossover operations to select the better genes to achieve crossover, and consequently enhance the genetic algorithms. Therefore, the HTGA approach can be more robust, statistically sound, and quickly convergent. First, the authors evaluate the performance of the presented HTGA approach by studying some global numerical optimization problems. Then, the presented HTGA approach is effectively applied to solve three examples on forecasting the sunspot numbers, tuning the associative memory, and solving the XOR problem. The numbers of hidden nodes and the links of the feedforward neural network are chosen by increasing them from small numbers until the learning performance is good enough. As a result, a partially connected feedforward neural network can be obtained after tuning. This implies that the cost of implementation of the neural network can be reduced. In these studied problems of tuning both network structure and parameters of a feedforward neural network, there are many parameters and numerous local optima so that these studied problems are challenging enough for evaluating the performances of any proposed GA-based approaches. The computational experiments show that the presented HTGA approach can obtain better results than the existing method reported recently in the literature.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2005.860885","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1593693","Genetic algorithm (GA);neural networks (NN);Taguchi method","Neural networks;Feedforward neural networks;Artificial neural networks;Genetic algorithms;Signal processing algorithms;Genetic mutations;Robustness;Associative memory;Costs;Performance evaluation","feedforward neural nets;Taguchi methods;genetic algorithms;content-addressable storage;tuning;inference mechanisms","feedforward neural network;hybrid Taguchi genetic algorithm;network structure;systematic reasoning capability;associative memory;tuning","Algorithms;Genetics;Memory;Neural Networks (Computer);Solar Activity","204","","41","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared to high power converters, the control loop bandwidths for converters in the lower power range are generally much higher. Because of this, the dynamic properties of the uniformly-sampled pulse-width modulators (PWMs) used in low power applications become an important restriction to the maximum achievable bandwidth of the control loop. Though frequency- and Laplace-domain models for uniformly-sampled PWMs are very valuable as they improve the general perception of the dynamic behavior of these modulators, the direct discrete design of the digital compensator requires a$z$-domain model for the combination modulator and converter. For this purpose a new exact small-signal$z$-domain model is derived. In accordance with the zero-order-hold equivalent commonly used for “regular” digital control systems, this$z$-domain model gives rise to the development of a uniformly-sampled PWM equivalent of the converter. This$z$-domain model is characterized by its capability to quantify the different dynamics of the converter for different modulators, its ease of use and its ability to predict the values of the control variables at the true sampling instants of the real system.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2005.869758","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1603679","Converter modeling;digital control;digital pulse-width modulator (PWM)","Image analysis;Digital control;Image converters;Pulse width modulation;Bandwidth;Pulse width modulation converters;Digital modulation;Microcontrollers;Switching converters;Space vector pulse width modulation","","Converter modeling;digital control;digital pulse-width modulator (PWM)","","122","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The fact that mutual coupling becomes more pronounced as antenna spacing decreases is therefore a critical issue with compact arrays used in portable MIMO radios. The contributions made in this paper include the realization of compact MIMO arrays designed to preserve channel capacity and the characterization of these compact arrays' performance in field measurements using MIMO radios. A multiport metric is used to characterize the compact arrays in a way that more appropriately measures array performance under MIMO signalling conditions than the traditional scattering matrix characterization. Field measurements show the extent and proportion of the effect that correlation and radiation efficiency have on MIMO channel capacity. The compact arrays' strong performance in field measurements is explained by their ability to preserve the MIMO channel's eigenstructure. Results also show that mutual coupling prevents channel capacity from scaling linearly with the number of antennas.

Center of Excellence, South Dakota State Univ., Brookings, SD, USA; NA; NA","IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","","2006","3","1","112","116","Several studies have used satellite data to map different levels of fire severity present within burned areas. Increasingly, fire severity has been estimated using a spectral index called the normalized burn ratio (NBR). This letter assesses the performance of the NBR against ideal requirements of a spectral index designed to measure fire severity. According to index theory, the NBR would be optimal for quantifying fire severity if the trajectory in spectral feature space caused by different levels of severity occurred perpendicular to the NBR isolines. We assess how well NBR meets this condition using reflectance data sensed before and shortly after fires in the South African savanna, Australian savanna, Russian Federation boreal forest, and South American tropical forest. Although previous studies report high correlation between fire severity measured in the field- and satellite-derived NBR, our results do not provide evidence that the performance of the NBR is optimal in describing fire severity shortly after fire occurrence. Spectral displacements due to burning occur in numerous directions relative to the NBR index isolines, suggesting that the NBR may not be primarily and consistently sensitive to fire severity. Findings suggest that the development of the next generation of methods to estimate fire severity remotely should incorporate knowledge of how fires of different severity displace the position of prefire vegetation in multispectral space.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2005.858485","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1576701","Fire severity;remote sensing;spectral index","Remote sensing;Fires;Reflectivity;Satellites;Vegetation mapping;Ecosystems;NASA;Soil;Fuels;Biomedical optical imaging","fires;forestry;vegetation;remote sensing;geophysical techniques","remote sensing;fire severity;normalized burn ratio;spectral index;index theory;reflectance data;South African savanna;Australian savanna;Russian Federation boreal forest;South American tropical forest;spectral displacements;NBR index isolines","","166","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, it can estimate the uncertainty value for each input sample according to its output score from a classifier and select only samples with uncertainty value above a user-defined threshold. Even though we cannot guarantee the optimality of the proposed approach, we find it to provide good performance.

The predictive trajectory merge-and-split algorithm is used to detect partial or complete occlusions during object motion and incorporates a Kalman filter that is used to perform vehicle tracking. The resulting motion trajectories are modeled using variable low-degree polynomials. A K-means clustering technique on the coefficient space can be used to obtain approximate lane centers. Estimation bias due to vehicle lane changes can be removed using robust estimation techniques based on Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC). Through the use of nonmetric distance functions and a simple directional indicator, highway lanes can be classified into one of the following categories: entry, exit, primary, or secondary.

The paper presents a comparative analysis of two state observers for induction-motor (IM) drives: the speed-adaptive observer and the inherently sensorless observer. The adaptive observer employs the time-variable full-order motor model with the rotor speed as the adaptive quantity. Thus, the speed estimation accuracy significantly impacts on the flux observer. It is shown that the popular model reference adaptive system (MRAS) speed estimator displays reduced bandwidth, and does not deliver adequate performance for the flux estimation. The inherently sensorless observer employs a full-order dual reference-frame model in order to eliminate the speed adaptation. In this way, it becomes decoupled from the speed estimator and its performance is superior to that of its adaptive counterpart. Theoretical aspects and comparative simulation results are discussed for both observers. Comparative experimental results for both observers are presented. Very low-speed-operation (3 r/min) capability of the drive with the sensorless observer is demonstrated.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2005.862314","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1589366","Adaptive observers;induction-motor (IM) drives;sensorless control;sliding-mode observers (SMOs);variable-speed drives","Observers;Frequency estimation;Rotors;Sensorless control;Stators;Stability;Low pass filters;Cutoff frequency;Adaptive systems;Displays","induction motor drives;variable speed drives;machine vector control;model reference adaptive control systems;observers;variable structure systems;rotors","speed-adaptive observer;sensorless control;variable-speed induction-motor drive;state observer;AC drive;time-variable full-order motor model;rotor;flux observer;model reference adaptive system;full-order dual reference-frame model;speed estimator;sliding-mode observer","","102","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

How to compute this score quickly, on huge, disk-resident, real graphs? Random walk with restart (RWR) provides a good relevance score between two nodes in a weighted graph, and it has been successfully used in numerous settings, like automatic captioning of images, generalizations to the ""connection subgraphs"", personalized PageRank, and many more. However, the straightforward implementations of RWR do not scale for large graphs, requiring either quadratic space and cubic pre-computation time, or slow response time on queries. We propose fast solutions to this problem. The heart of our approach is to exploit two important properties shared by many real graphs: (a) linear correlations and (b) block- wise, community-like structure. We exploit the linearity by using low-rank matrix approximation, and the community structure by graph partitioning, followed by the Sherman- Morrison lemma for matrix inversion. Experimental results on the Corel image and the DBLP dabasets demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve significant savings over the straightforward implementations: they can save several orders of magnitude in pre-computation and storage cost, and they achieve up to 150x speed up with 90%+ quality preservation.","2374-8486","978-0-7695-2701-7","10.1109/ICDM.2006.70","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4053087","","Costs;Sparse matrices;Delay;Image storage;Niobium;Time factors;Heart;Linearity;Error analysis;Design optimization","graph theory;random processes","random walk with restart;weighted graph;connection subgraphs;low-rank matrix approximation;Sherman-Morrison lemma;graph partitioning;matrix inversion","","295","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the better performance comes at the price of the extraordinarily huge computational complexity and memory access requirement, which makes it difficult to design a hardwired encoder for real-time applications. In addition, due to the complex, sequential, and highly data-dependent characteristics of the essential algorithms in H.264/AVC, both the pipelining and the parallel processing techniques are constrained to be employed. The hardware utilization and throughput are also decreased because of the block/MB/frame-level reconstruction loops. In this paper, we describe our techniques to design the H.264/AVC video encoder for HDTV applications. On the system design level, in consideration of the characteristics of the key components and the reconstruction loops, the four-stage macroblock pipelined system architecture is first proposed with an efficient scheduling and memory hierarchy. On the module design level, the design considerations of the significant modules are addressed followed by the hardware architectures, including low-bandwidth integer motion estimation, parallel fractional motion estimation, reconfigurable intrapredictor generator, dual-buffer block-pipelined entropy coder, and deblocking filter.

We derive a mixing result for PageRank vectors similar to that for random walks, and show that the ordering of the vertices produced by a PageRank vector reveals a cut with small conductance. In particular, we show that for any set C with conductance Phi and volume k, a PageRank vector with a certain starting distribution can be used to produce a set with conductance (O(radic(Phi log k)). We present an improved algorithm for computing approximate PageRank vectors, which allows us to find such a set in time proportional to its size. In particular, we can find a cut with conductance at most oslash, whose small side has volume at least 2b in time O(2 log m/(2b log2 m/oslash2) where m is the number of edges in the graph.

We will first review thermal conductivity of low-dimensional solids. Experimental results have shown that phonon surface and interface scattering can lower thermal conductivity of silicon thin films and nanowires in the sub-100-nm range by a factor of two to five. Carbon nanotubes are promising candidates as thermal vias and thermal interface materials due to their inherently high thermal conductivities of thousands of W/mK and high mechanical strength. We then concentrate on the fundamental interaction between heat and electricity, i.e., thermoelectric effects, and how nanostructures are used to modify this interaction. We will review recent experimental and theoretical results on superlattice and quantum dot thermoelectrics as well as solid-state thermionic thin-film devices with embedded metallic nanoparticles. Heat and current spreading in the three-dimensional electrode configuration, allow removal of high-power hot spots in IC chips.

They have achieved cooling up to 7 degC at 100 degC ambient temperature with devices on the order of 50 mum in diameter. The cooling power density was also characterized using integrated thin-film heaters; values ranging from 100 to 680 W/cm2 were measured. Response time on the order of 20-40 ms has been demonstrated. Calculations show that with an improvement in material properties, hot spots tens of micrometers in diameter with heat fluxes in excess of 1000 W/cm2 could be cooled down by 20 degC-30 degC.

On the other hand, sacrificing the testability for security by abandoning the scan-based DFT hurts the product quality. The security of a crypto chip comes from the small secret key stored in a few registers, and the testability of a crypto chip comes from the data path and control path implementing the crypto algorithm. Based on this key observation, the authors propose a novel scan DFT architecture called secure scan that maintains the high test quality of traditional scan DFT without compromising the security.

Against this background, we analyzed the effect of different bipolar configuration directions on EMG-based force estimation. In addition, we investigated whether principal component analysis (PCA) can improve this estimation. High-density surface-EMG from the triceps brachii muscle and the extension force of the elbow were measured in 11 subjects. The root mean square difference (RMSD) between predicted and measured force was determined. We found the best bipolar configuration direction to cause a 13% lower RMSD relative to the worst direction. Optimal results were obtained with electrodes aligned with the expected main muscle fiber direction. We found that PCA reduced RMSD by about 40% compared to conventional bipolar electrodes and by about 12% compared to optimally aligned multiple bipolar electrodes. Thus, PCA contributes to the accuracy of EMG-based estimation of muscle force when using a high-density EMG grid.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2006.870246","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1608521","Force estimation;heterogeneous muscle fiber architecture;human;principal component analysis;redundancy;surface electromyography","Muscles;Electromyography;Principal component analysis;Electrodes;Force measurement;Accuracy;Biomechanics;Humans;Elbow;Root mean square","electromyography;force;principal component analysis;biomechanics;biomedical electrodes","electromyography;muscle force estimation;high-density EMG grid;principal component analysis;biomechanics;kinesiology;human skeletal muscles;triceps brachii muscle;elbow extension force;bipolar electrodes","Algorithms;Arm;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electromyography;Female;Humans;Isometric Contraction;Male;Muscle, Skeletal;Principal Component Analysis;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Stress, Mechanical","85","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

From the numerical-integration viewpoint, various versions of Gaussian filters are only distinctive from each other in their specific treatments of approximating the multiple statistical integrations. A common base is provided for the first time to analyze and compare Gaussian filters with respect to accuracy, efficiency and stability factor. This study is expected to facilitate the selection of appropriate Gaussian filters in practice and to help design more efficient filters by employing better numerical integration methods","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2006.875389","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1658247","Cramer–Rao bound;Gaussian filter;monomial;nonlinear filtering;numerical-integration;product rule;stability factor","Filters;Filtering;Bayesian methods;Gaussian approximation;State-space methods;Probability distribution;Jacobian matrices;Stability analysis;Numerical stability","Bayes methods;filtering theory;Gaussian processes;integration;numerical stability","numerical-integration perspective;Gaussian filters;Bayesian inference approximation;Gaussian posterior probability density;multiple statistical integrations;stability factor","","163","","51","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For nonrigid shapes, however, the local relationship among neighboring points is stronger and more stable than the global one. In this paper, we introduce the notion of a neighborhood structure for the general point matching problem. We formulate point matching as an optimization problem to preserve local neighborhood structures during matching. Our approach has a simple graph matching interpretation, where each point is a node in the graph, and two nodes are connected by an edge if they are neighbors. The optimal match between two graphs is the one that maximizes the number of matched edges. Existing techniques are leveraged to search for an optimal solution with the shape context distance used to initialize the graph matching, followed by relaxation labeling updates for refinement. Extensive experiments show the robustness of our approach under deformation, noise in point locations, outliers, occlusion, and rotation. It outperforms the shape context and TPS-RPM algorithms on most scenarios.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2006.81","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1597120","Point matching;shape matching;image registration;nonrigid shapes;relaxation labeling.","Shape;Optimal matching;Labeling;Image registration;Humans;Noise robustness;Noise shaping;Pattern matching;Image edge detection;Computer vision","image registration;pattern matching;optimisation","robust point matching;nonrigid shapes;local neighborhood structure preservation;joint distribution;neighborhood points;optimization problem;graph matching interpretation;shape context distance;relaxation labeling;TPS-RPM algorithms","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Graphics;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique","194","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By employing the agrave trous algorithm of the wavelet transformation (WT), the respiration rhythm and pulse rate can be monitored in real-time from a pressure signal acquired with a pressure sensor placed under a pillow. The waveform for respiration rhythm detection is derived from the 26 scale approximation, while that for pulse rate detection is synthesized by combining the 24 and 25 scale details. To minimize the latency in data processing and realize the highest real-time performance, the respiration rhythm and pulse rate are estimated by using waveforms directly derived from the WT approximation and detail components without the reconstruction procedure. This method is evaluated with data collected from 13 healthy subjects. By comparing with detections from finger photoelectric plethysmograms used for pulse rate detection, the sensitivity and positive predictivity were 99.17% and 98.53%, respectively. Similarly, for respiration rhythm, compared with detections from nasal thermistor signals, results were 95.63% and 95.42%, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a class of VAD algorithms based on several statistical models. In addition to the Gaussian model, we also incorporate the complex Laplacian and Gamma probability density functions to our analysis of statistical properties. With a goodness-of-fit tests, we analyze the statistical properties of the DFT spectra of the noisy speech under various noise conditions. Based on the statistical analysis, the likelihood ratio test under the given statistical models is established for the purpose of VAD. Since the statistical characteristics of the speech signal are differently affected by the noise types and levels, to cope with the time-varying environments, our approach is aimed at finding adaptively an appropriate statistical model in an online fashion.

The tactile display of this study consists of a thin conductive film slider with stator electrodes that excite electrostatic forces. Users of the device experience tactile texture sensations by moving the slider with their fingers. The display operates by applying two-phase cyclic voltage patterns to the electrodes. The display is incorporated into a tactile telepresentation system to realize explorations of remote surface textures with real-time tactile feedback. In the system, a PVDF tactile sensor and a DSP controller automatically generate voltage patterns to present surface texture sensations through the tactile display. A sensor, in synchronization with finger motion on the tactile display, scans a texture sample and outputs information about the sample surface. The information is processed by a DSP and fed back to the tactile display in real time. The tactile telepresentation system was evaluated in texture discrimination tests and demonstrated a 79 percent correct answer ratio. A transparent electrostatic tactile display is also reported in which the tactile display is combined with an LCD to realize a visual-tactile integrated display system.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2006.28","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1580451","Artificial;augmented;and virtual realities;Haptic I/O.","Electrostatics;Transistors;Liquid crystal displays;Surface texture;Conductive films;Electrodes;Fingers;Tactile sensors;Digital signal processing;Virtual reality","haptic interfaces;virtual reality;electrostatic devices;tactile sensors","electrostatic tactile display;thin film slider;tactile telepresentation system;virtual reality system;electrostatic force;tactile texture sensation;remote surface texture;tactile sensor;visual-tactile integrated display system","Computer Peripherals;Data Display;Electrodes;Electrostatics;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Fingers;Humans;Internet;Membranes, Artificial;Pilot Projects;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Stress, Mechanical;Telecommunications;Touch;Transducers;User-Computer Interface","108","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A stator flux observer in wide speed range uses combined voltage-current models for low speeds, and only the voltage model for medium to high speeds, both in proportional-integral closed loop.

They have found application domains in battlefield communication, homeland security, pollution sensing, and traffic monitoring. As such, there has been an increasing need to define and develop simulation frameworks for carrying out high-fidelity WSN simulation. In this article we present a modeling, simulation, and emulation framework for WSNs in J-Sim - an open source, component-based compositional network simulation environment developed entirely in Java. This framework is built on the autonomous component architecture and extensible internetworking framework of J-Sim, and provides an object-oriented definition of target, sensor, and sink nodes, sensor and wireless communication channels, and physical media such as seismic channels, mobility models, and power models (both energy-producing and energy-consuming components). Application-specific models can be defined by subclassing classes in the simulation framework and customizing their behaviors. We also include in J-Sim a set of classes and mechanisms to realize network emulation. We demonstrate the use of the proposed WSN simulation framework by implementing several well-known localization, geographic routing, and directed diffusion protocols, and perform performance comparisons (in terms of the execution time incurred and memory used) in simulating WSN scenarios in J-Sim and ns-2. The simulation study indicates the WSN framework in J-Sim is much more scalable than ns-2 (especially in memory usage). We also demonstrate the use of the WSN framework in carrying out real-life full-fledged Future Combat System (FCS) simulation and emulation","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.2006.1678171","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1678171","","Emulation;Wireless sensor networks;Object oriented modeling;Terrorism;Pollution;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Monitoring;Java;Component architectures","Java;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication computing;wireless channels;wireless sensor networks","J-Sim;wireless sensor networks;component-based compositional network;Java;wireless communication channels;seismic channels;mobility models;power models;application-specific models;geographic routing;directed diffusion protocols","","147","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The properties of the solving set are investigated, and algorithms for computing it, with subquadratic time requirements, are proposed. Experiments on synthetic and real data sets to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach are presented. A scaling analysis of the solving set size is performed, and the false positive rate, that is, the fraction of new objects misclassified as outliers using the solving set instead of the overall data set, is shown to be negligible.

Data confidentiality and authenticity are critical in these settings. However, the wireless connectivity, the absence of physical protection, the close interaction between WSNs and their physical environment, and the unattended deployment of WSNs make them highly vulnerable to node capture as well as a wide range of network-level attacks. Moreover, the constrained energy, memory, and computational capabilities of the employed sensor nodes limit the adoption of security solutions designed for wire-line and wireless networks. In this paper, we focus on the management of encryption keys in large-scale clustered WSNs. We propose a novel distributed key management scheme based on exclusion basis systems (EBS); a combinatorial formulation of the group key management problem. Our scheme is termed SHELL because it is scalable, hierarchical, efficient, location-aware, and light-weight. Unlike most existing key management schemes for WSNs, SHELL supports rekeying and, thus, enhances network security and survivability against node capture. SHELL distributes key management functionality among multiple nodes and minimizes the memory and energy consumption through trading off the number of keys and rekeying messages. In addition, SHELL employs a novel key assignment scheme that reduces the potential of collusion among compromised sensor nodes by factoring the geographic location of nodes in key assignment. Simulation results demonstrate that SHELL significantly boosts the network resilience to attacks while conservatively consuming nodes' resources","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2006.106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1652948","Wireless sensor networks;secure group communications;key management;location-aware protocols;exclusion basis systems;combinatorial optimization;energy efficient design;collusion attacks.","Wireless sensor networks;Protection;Surveillance;Computer networks;Cryptography;Large-scale systems;Energy management;Memory management;Energy consumption;Resilience","protocols;public key cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","location-aware protocols;combinatorial key management scheme;clustered sensor networks;wireless sensor networks;WSN;encryption key management;distributed key management scheme;exclusion basis systems;EBS;SHELL;energy consumption;network security;network level attack","","141","","47","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the ultimate goal of building personal music information retrieval systems, this paper studies the problem of intelligent music information retrieval. Huron points out that since the preeminent functions of music are social and psychological, the most useful characterization would be based on four types of information: genre, emotion, style,and similarity. This paper introduces Daubechies Wavelet Coefficient Histograms (DWCH)for music feature extraction for music information retrieval. The histograms are computed from the coefficients of the db/sub 8/ Daubechies wavelet filter applied to 3 s of music. A comparative study of sound features and classification algorithms on a dataset compiled by Tzanetakis shows that combining DWCH with timbral features (MFCC and FFT), with the use of multiclass extensions of support vector machine,achieves approximately 80% of accuracy, which is a significant improvement over the previously known result on this dataset. On another dataset the combination achieves 75% of accuracy. The paper also studies the issue of detecting emotion in music. Rating of two subjects in the three bipolar adjective pairs are used. The accuracy of around 70% was achieved in predicting emotional labeling in these adjective pairs. The paper also studies the problem of identifying groups of artists based on their lyrics and sound using a semi-supervised classification algorithm. Identification of artist groups based on the Similar Artist lists at All Music Guide is attempted. The semi-supervised learning algorithm resulted in nontrivial increases in the accuracy to more than 70%. Finally, the paper conducts a proof-of-concept experiment on similarity search using the feature set.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2006.870730","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1632041","Clustering;FFT;machine learning;music information retrieval;wavelet","Music information retrieval;Histograms;Classification algorithms;Intelligent structures;Psychology;Wavelet coefficients;Feature extraction;Filters;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Labeling","music;information retrieval;feature extraction;wavelet transforms;support vector machines;emotion recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);information retrieval systems","intelligent music information retrieval;personal music information retrieval system;Daubechies wavelet coefficient histogram;music feature extraction;Daubechies wavelet filter;support vector machine;emotion detection;semisupervised classification algorithm","","80","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This evidence was collected over the course of a 30-month case study of a large software development project undergoing requirements process improvement. Our findings add to the scarce evidence on RE payoffs and, more importantly, represent an in-depth explanation of the role of requirements engineering processes in contributing to these benefits. In particular, the results of our case study show that an effective requirements process at the beginning of the project had positive outcomes throughout the project lifecycle, improving the efficacy of other project processes, ultimately leading to improvements in project negotiation, project planning, and managing feature creep, testing, defects, rework, and product quality. Finally, we consider the role collaboration had in producing the effects we observed and the implications of this work to both research and practice","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2006.61","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1677531","Requirements engineering;process improvement;process interactions;empirical investigation.","Productivity;Risk management;Software engineering;Programming;Process planning;Quality management;Project management;Creep;Life testing;Collaborative work","formal specification;project management;risk management;software development management;software process improvement;software quality","requirements engineering;software engineering;risk management;software development project;software process improvement;project lifecycle;software quality","","104","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Given an image sequence, temporal dependencies of consecutive segmentation fields and spatial dependencies within each segmentation field are unified by a dynamic probabilistic framework based on the conditional random field (CRF). An efficient approximate filtering algorithm is derived for the DCRF model to recursively estimate the segmentation field from the history of observed images. The foreground and shadow segmentation method integrates both intensity and gradient features. Moreover, models of background, shadow, and gradient information are updated adaptively for nonstationary background processes.

Although traditional HRV (tHRV) analysis has shown to provide information on cardiac ANS control, it often fails to isolate the effect of two branches in HRV signals. This problem becomes more obvious especially at low respiratory rates since parasympathetic activity shifts into lower frequencies and overlaps the frequency interval where sympathetic region is defined. To investigate the effect of respiration in HRV analysis we have analyzed the data of 17 healthy subjects while they were performing normal breathing (NB) and deep breathing (DB).

A rigorous theoretic proof is given to show that the proposed condition can include previous results as special cases. In comparison with conventional conditions, the proposed condition is not only suitable for designing fuzzy state feedback controllers but also convenient for fuzzy static output feedback controller design. The latter design work is quite hard for T-S fuzzy control systems. Based on the LMI-based conditions derived, one can easily synthesize controllers for stabilizing T-S fuzzy control systems. Since only a set of LMIs is involved, the controller design is quite simple and numerically tractable.

Resolution of a Vernier TDC is extremely susceptible to process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variations. The proposed compact implementation thereby minimizes the susceptibility of the TDC resolution to PVT variations. In the proposed method, time is digitized to the nearest multiple of a constant buffer delay and finer time digitization, less than one buffer delay is carried out using Vernier delay line.

We demonstrate this by comparing our simulation to experimental data for a splitting droplet. Without these boundary effects, the simulation shows the droplet splitting into three pieces instead of two and the motion is over 15 times faster than the experiment. We then show how including the saturation characteristics of the device, and a simple model of contact angle hysteresis, allows the simulation to better predict the splitting experiment. The match is not perfect and suffers mainly because contact line pinning is not included. This is followed by a comparison between our simulation, whose parameters are now frozen, and a new experiment involving bulk droplet motion. Our numerical implementation uses the level set method, is fast, and is being used to design algorithms for the precise control of microdroplet motion, mixing, and splitting","1941-0158","","10.1109/JMEMS.2006.878876","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1668195","Control;electrowetting;level set method;microfluidics;modeling;two-phase flow","Fluid dynamics;Hysteresis;Predictive models;Dielectric devices;Surface tension;Equations;Shape;Level set;Algorithm design and analysis;Motion control","electrochemistry;fluid dynamics;microfluidics;surface tension;wetting","fluid dynamics;electrowetting;dielectric device;EWOD;fluid droplets;surface tension effects;Hele-Shaw type equations;boundary phenomena;contact angle saturation;splitting droplet;contact angle hysteresis;bulk droplet motion","","91","","56","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A key step in a traditional Kalman filter requires minimizing an estimation error variance between a clean signal and its estimation. Our new method is to minimize the estimation error variance under the constraint that the energy of the estimation error is smaller than a masking threshold, computed from both time-domain forward masking and frequency-domain simultaneous masking properties of human auditory systems. The new Kalman filter provides a theoretical base for the application of the masking properties in Kalman filtering for speech enhancement. Due to the high computation cost of the proposed perceptually constrained Kalman filter, a perceptual post-filter concatenated with a standard Kalman filter is also proposed as a heuristic alternative for real-time implementation. The post-filter is constructed to make the estimation error obtained from the Kalman filter lower than the masking threshold. A wavelet Kalman filter with post-filtering is introduced to further reduce the computational load. Experimental results with colored noise show that the new constrained Kalman filter method produces the best performance when compared with other recent methods, and that the proposed heuristics with post-filtering can also produce a significant performance gain over other recent methods.","1558-7924","","10.1109/TSA.2005.858515","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1561260","Auditory masking;Kalman filtering;perceptual post-filtering;speech enhancement;wavelets","Speech enhancement;Masking threshold;Estimation error;Time domain analysis;Humans;Auditory system;Kalman filters;Filtering;Computational efficiency;Concatenated codes","speech enhancement;Kalman filters;speech intelligibility;wavelet transforms","speech enhancement;masking threshold constrained Kalman filter;estimation error variance;time-domain forward masking;frequency-domain simultaneous masking;human auditory systems;postfilter;wavelet Kalman filter;colored noise","","38","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The new approach for palmprint recognition using discrete cosine transform coefficients, which can be directly obtained from the camera hardware, is demonstrated. None of the prior work on hand-shape or palmprint recognition has given any attention on the critical issue of feature selection. Our experimental results demonstrate that while majority of palmprint or hand-shape features are useful in predicting the subjects identity, only a small subset of these features are necessary in practice for building an accurate model for identification. The comparison and combination of proposed features is evaluated on the diverse classification schemes; naive Bayes (normal, estimated, multinomial), decision trees (C4.5, LMT), /spl kappa/-NN, SVM, and FFN.

Benefits from this, integration of metal electrodes and wires between the bonding interfaces becomes possible. Moreover, since adhesive bonding does not necessitate extremely smooth contact surface, nor does it rely on the cleanliness of ambient environment, it is possible to carry out this process in a standard chemistry lab, and join different substrates without any pre-treatment. Initial inspection results showed that this method has a satisfactory yielding rate of more than 90%, and an acceptable bonding strength of above 2 MPa.

Some of the big challenges have always been cost and complexity, as well as power consumption. While there have been a plurality of proprietary wireless systems developed over the past decade or so for application to this problem, these systems have suffered from an inability to scale well in cost and network complexity. In 2003, the IEEE 802.15.4 standard was ratified, and almost immediately silicon manufacturers began producing compliant single-chip radios. Now, the next generation of transceiver is on the horizon, complete with microcontroller and FLASH memory, as well as the potential for various environmental sensors to be built right into the silicon itself. IEEE STD 802.15.4 specifies the RF, PHY and MAC layers, and there are a variety of custom and industry-standards based networking protocols that can sit atop this IEEE stack. These networking protocols allow the rapid creation of mesh networks that are also self-healing. With energy-saving features designed into the basic IEEE standard, and other possibilities applied by the applications developer, IEEE 802.15.4 radios have the potential to be the cost-effective communications backbone for simple sensory mesh networks that can effectively harvest data with relatively low latency, high accuracy, and the ability to survive for a very long time on small primary batteries or energy-scavenging mechanisms like solar, vibrational, or thermal power. This paper will look closely at the IEEE standard and the features that are natively part of the standard. Some of the various networking protocols that are proposed for or being used on top of this standard will be discussed, including ZigBee networking and IPV6. Practical sensor devices employing the technology will be analyzed and power consumption investigated. In addition, the ongoing updates to the standard taking place now within the IEEE will be discussed in light of their potential to make products developed to this standard even more useful to the sensor community","1095-323X","0-7803-9545-X","10.1109/AERO.2006.1655947","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1655947","","Protocols;Standards development;Costs;Energy consumption;Silicon;Mesh networks;Wireless sensor networks;Manufacturing;Transceivers;Microcontrollers","access protocols;flash memories;IEEE standards;microcontrollers;primary cells;transceivers;wireless sensor networks","sensor nets;power consumption;wireless systems;network complexity;single-chip radios;radio transceivers;microcontroller;flash memory;networking protocols;sensory mesh networks;primary batteries;solar power;vibrational power;thermal power;ZigBee networking;IPV6;IEEE 802.15.4 standard;RF layer;PHY layer;MAC layer","","28","","2","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Gray-level grouping (GLG): an automatic method for optimized image contrast enhancement - part II: the variations","ZhiYu Chen; B. R. Abidi; D. L. Page; M. A. Abidi","Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Tennessee Univ., Knoxville, TN, USA; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","","2006","15","8","2303","2314","This is Part II of the paper, ""Gray-Level Grouping (GLG): an Automatic Method for Optimized Image Contrast Enhancement"". Part I of this paper introduced a new automatic contrast enhancement technique: gray-level grouping (GLG). GLG is a general and powerful technique, which can be conveniently applied to a broad variety of low-contrast images and outperforms conventional contrast enhancement techniques. However, the basic GLG method still has limitations and cannot enhance certain classes of low-contrast images well, e.g., images with a noisy background. The basic GLG also cannot fulfill certain special application purposes, e.g., enhancing only part of an image which corresponds to a certain segment of the image histogram. In order to break through these limitations, this paper introduces an extension of the basic GLG algorithm, selective gray-level grouping (SGLG), which groups the histogram components in different segments of the grayscale using different criteria and, hence, is able to enhance different parts of the histogram to various extents. This paper also introduces two new preprocessing methods to eliminate background noise in noisy low-contrast images so that such images can be properly enhanced by the (S)GLG technique. The extension of (S)GLG to color images is also discussed in this paper. SGLG and its variations extend the capability of the basic GLG to a larger variety of low-contrast images, and can fulfill special application requirements. SGLG and its variations not only produce results superior to conventional contrast enhancement techniques, but are also fully automatic under most circumstances, and are applicable to a broad variety of images.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2006.875201","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1658094","Contrast enhancement;gray-level grouping;histogram;noise reduction","Optimization methods;Histograms;Background noise;Image segmentation;Gray-scale;Noise level;X-ray imaging;Color;Noise reduction;US Department of Energy","image enhancement;image denoising;image segmentation;image colour analysis","selective gray-level grouping;automatic contrast enhancement technique;optimized image contrast enhancement;low-contrast images;background noise elimination;image histogram;grayscale segments;color images","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Colorimetry;Computer Simulation;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Quality Control","91","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Development of a biometric system for personal identification, which fulfills the requirements for access control of secured areas and other applications like identity validation for social welfare, crime detection, ATM access, computer security, etc. is felt to be the need of the day. Face recognition has been evolving as a convenient biometric mode for human authentication for more than last two decades. Several vendors around the world claim the successful working of their face recognition systems. However, the Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) conducted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NISI), USA, indicates that the commercial face recognition systems do not perform up to the mark under the variations ubiquitously present in a real-life situation. Availability of a largely accepted robust face recognition system has proved elusive so far. Keeping in view the importance of indigenous development of biometric systems to cater to the requirements at BARC and elsewhere in the country, the work was started on the development of a face-based biometric authentication system. In this paper, we discuss our efforts in developing a face recognition system that functions successfully under a reasonably constrained set-up for facial image acquisition. The prototype system built in our lab finds facial match by utilizing multi-algorithmic multi-biometric technique, combining gray level statistical correlation method with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) techniques in order to boost our system performance. After automatic detection of the face in the image and its gross scale correction, its PCA and DCT signatures are extracted. Based on a comparison of the extracted signature with the set of references, the set of top five hits are selected. Exact scale of the face is ascertained w.r.t. each of these hits by first locating the eyes employing template matching technique and then finding the inter-ocular distance. After interpolating the face to the exact scale, matching scores are computed based on gray level correlation of a number of features on the face. Final identification decision is taken amongst this set of five faces, depending on the highest score. We have tested the technique on a set of 109 images belonging to 43 subjects, both male and female. The result on this image-set indicates 89% success rate of our technique.","","1-4244-0715-X","10.1109/ADCOM.2006.4289908","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4289908","Face recognition;Identification;Multi-algorithmic;Multi-biometric;Discrete Cosine Transform;Principal Component Analysis;Correlation","Face recognition;Biometrics;Principal component analysis;Discrete cosine transforms;Face detection;Authentication;Access control;Application software;Computer security;Humans","biometrics (access control);correlation methods;digital signatures;discrete cosine transforms;face recognition;feature extraction;image matching;principal component analysis","principal component analysis signature;discrete cosine transform signature;automatic face detection;gross scale correction;template matching;multialgorithmic face recognition system;personal authenticity;personal identification;access control;human authentication;face recognition vendor test;face-based biometric authentication system;facial image acquisition;statistical correlation method;interpolation","","9","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The design center frequencies were 1.26 GHz and 1.413 GHz with 10 MHz and 25 MHz bandwidths in each band, respectively. Due to the large number of design parameters and demanding design requirements of beam-efficiency, sidelobe levels, and polarization characteristics, particle-swarm optimization (PSO) and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations were used for synthesis and analysis. Cancellation techniques, based on symmetry, were applied to the antenna ports, with a custom-built feed network to reduce cross polarization. Simulations and measurement results from a spherical near-field test facility confirmed excellent performance of the array configuration, with a beam efficiency of greater than 90%, isolation better than -35 dB, and cross polarization in the main beam of the array better than -40 dB.

In this paper, an algorithm to achieve fast multiplication in two's complement representation is presented. Rather than focusing on reducing the partial products rows down to final sums and carries, our approach strives to generate fewer partial products rows. In turn, this influences the speed of the multiplication, even before applying partial products reduction techniques.

Such a model provides mathematically coherent and sound basis for systematically aggregating uncertain evidences from different sources, augmented with relevant contextual information. The static model, however, fails to capture the dynamic aspect of fatigue. Fatigue is a cognitive state that is developed over time. To account for the temporal aspect of human fatigue, the static fatigue model is extended based on dynamic Bayesian networks. The dynamic fatigue model allows to integrate fatigue evidences not only spatially but also temporally, therefore, leading to a more robust and accurate fatigue modeling and inference. A real-time nonintrusive fatigue monitor was built based on integrating the proposed fatigue model with a computer vision system developed for extracting various visual cues typically related to fatigue.

In order to improve DRAM retention time characteristics, leakage current must be reduced and various solutions are proposed. The major leakage paths in a DRAM cell stem from reverse junction leakage from the storage node, and gate induced drain leakage (GIDL) current. Empirically it is known that the junction leakage is affected by the lateral electric field near the storage node, which is enhanced by an increase in substrate doping due to threshold adjustment. The DRAM cell becomes more susceptible to GIDL when the storage node stores a ""1"" and a negative bias is applied to the gate. The voltage drop across the gate oxide creates a vertical electric field that leads to a higher leakage current. In this paper, these leakage paths are investigated with device simulation. Tradeoffs between substrate doping, gate thickness and leakage are explored using Silvaco Atonable/Atlas. The DRAM cell was modeled using a 0.24 mum NMOS transistor. Substrate doping was varied to analyze its effect on depletion region, lateral electric field, and reverse current. Device simulation has shown that a lower substrate doping yields better results on lateral field and reverse current. As the substrate doping was reduced from 5.8times1017cm-3 to 9times1016cm-3, the lateral field decreased from 7.25times105V/cm to 5.6times105V/cm. Subsequently, the reverse current decreased from 3.1 pA to 0.5 pA. The GIDL was explored by varying LDD implantation energy and gate oxide thickness. As oxide thickness increased, the vertical field decreased because the voltage drop occurred over a larger distance. The vertical field was reduced from 1.25times106V/cm to 6.9times105V/cm when the oxide thickness was increased from 11.7 to 21.6 nm.","2375-5350","1-4244-0267-0","10.1109/UGIM.2006.4286380","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4286380","","Leakage current;Random access memory;Voltage;Doping;Capacitors;MOSFETs;Design engineering;DRAM chips;Lead compounds;Semiconductor process modeling","DRAM chips;integrated circuit modelling;ion implantation;leakage currents;MOSFET circuits;semiconductor doping","DRAM memory cell;dynamic random access memory cell;reverse junction leakage;gate induced drain leakage current;GIDL current;voltage drop;vertical electric field;substrate doping;NMOS transistor;depletion region;lateral electric field;LDD implantation energy;gate oxide thickness;current 3.1 pA to 0.5 pA;size 11.7 nm to 21.6 nm;size 0.24 micron","","1","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus far, many characteristics of RSSI have not been thoroughly investigated. Many researchers have relied on the RSSI as sensor information to determine objects location while ignoring the characteristic of RSSI. Therefore, this paper looks into underlying mechanism of RSSI from the indoor positioning systems perspective. In particular, the distributions of RSSI from five different IEEE 802.11b/g WLAN interfaces are investigated using extensive measurement experiments.

However, such kinds of learning algorithms usually cannot minimize the empirical risk (training error) and expected risk (testing error) simultaneously, and thus cannot reach a good classification performance in the testing phase. To tackle this drawback, a support-vector-based fuzzy neural network (SVFNN) is proposed for pattern classification in this paper. The SVFNN combines the superior classification power of support vector machine (SVM) in high dimensional data spaces and the efficient human-like reasoning of FNN in handling uncertainty information. A learning algorithm consisting of three learning phases is developed to construct the SVFNN and train its parameters. In the first phase, the fuzzy rules and membership functions are automatically determined by the clustering principle. In the second phase, the parameters of FNN are calculated by the SVM with the proposed adaptive fuzzy kernel function. In the third phase, the relevant fuzzy rules are selected by the proposed reducing fuzzy rule method. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed SVFNN classification, it is applied to the Iris, Vehicle, Dna, Satimage, Ijcnn1 datasets from the UCI Repository, Statlog collection and IJCNN challenge 2001, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed SVFNN for pattern classification can achieve good classification performance with drastically reduced number of fuzzy kernel functions.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2005.861604","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1593641","Fuzzy kernel function;fuzzy neural network (FNN);kernel method;mercer theorem;pattern classification;support vector machine (SVM)","Fuzzy neural networks;Pattern classification;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Backpropagation algorithms;Testing;Kernel;Training data;Uncertainty;Clustering algorithms","support vector machines;fuzzy neural nets;pattern classification;pattern clustering;fuzzy logic","support-vector-based fuzzy neural networks;pattern classification;learning algorithm;support vector machine;adaptive fuzzy kernel function;fuzzy rules","","116","","45","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Here, context recognition refers to the automatic classification of the context or an environment around a device. A system is developed and compared to the accuracy of human listeners in the same task. Particular emphasis is placed on the computational complexity of the methods, since the application is of particular interest in resource-constrained portable devices. Simplistic low-dimensional feature vectors are evaluated against more standard spectral features. Using discriminative training, competitive recognition accuracies are achieved with very low-order hidden Markov models (1-3 Gaussian components). Slight improvement in recognition accuracy is observed when linear data-driven feature transformations are applied to mel-cepstral features. The recognition rate of the system as a function of the test sequence length appears to converge only after about 30 to 60 s.

The visual inspection is often carried out by a human expert. However, new technology features have made this inspection unreliable. For this reason, many researchers have been engaged to develop automatic analysis processes of manufactures and automatic optical inspections in the industrial production of printed circuit boards. Among the defects that could arise in this industrial process, those of the solder joints are very important, because they can lead to an incorrect functioning of the board; moreover, the amount of the solder paste can give some information on the quality of the industrial process. In this paper, a neural network-based automatic optical inspection system for the diagnosis of solder joint defects on printed circuit boards assembled in surface mounting technology is presented. The diagnosis is handled as a pattern recognition problem with a neural network approach. Five types of solder joints have been classified in respect to the amount of solder paste in order to perform the diagnosis with a high recognition rate and a detailed classification able to give information on the quality of the manufacturing process. The images of the boards under test are acquired and then preprocessed to extract the region of interest for the diagnosis. Three types of feature vectors are evaluated from each region of interest, which are the images of the solder joints under test, by exploiting the properties of the wavelet transform and the geometrical characteristics of the preprocessed images. The performances of three different classifiers which are a multilayer perceptron, a linear vector quantization, and a K-nearest neighbor classifier are compared. The n-fold cross-validation has been exploited to select the best architecture for the neural classifiers, while a number of experiments have been devoted to estimating the best value of K in the K-NN. The results have proved that the MLP network fed with the GW-features has the best recognition rate. This approach allows to carry out the diagnosis burden on image processing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms, reducing the cost and the complexity of the acquisition system. In fact, the experimental results suggest that the reason for the high recognition rate in the solder joint classification is due to the proper preprocessing steps followed as well as to the information contents of the features","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2006.877265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1668079","Feature extraction;image processing;neural networks;printed circuit board (PCB);solder printing;surface mounted technology (SMT);wavelet transform","Neural networks;Optical computing;Optical fiber networks;Soldering;Surface-mount technology;Manufacturing processes;Manufacturing industries;Automatic optical inspection;Printed circuits;Testing","automatic optical inspection;control engineering computing;image processing;multilayer perceptrons;printed circuit manufacture;solders;surface mount technology;wavelet transforms","neural networks application;optical inspection;optical classification;solder joints;surface mount technology;defect detection;industrial processes;visual inspection;industrial production;printed circuit boards production;pattern recognition problem;manufacturing process;wavelet transform;multilayer perceptron;linear vector quantization;K-nearest neighbor classifier;n-fold cross-validation;image processing;feature extraction;feature classification algorithms","","86","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We formulate this problem as one of minimizing the closed-loop norm of a feedback system subject to constraints on the controller structure. We define the notion of quadratic invariance of a constraint set with respect to a system, and show that if the constraint set has this property, then the constrained minimum-norm problem may be solved via convex programming. We also show that quadratic invariance is necessary and sufficient for the constraint set to be preserved under feedback. These results are developed in a very general framework, and are shown to hold in both continuous and discrete time, for both stable and unstable systems, and for any norm. This notion unifies many previous results identifying specific tractable decentralized control problems, and delineates the largest known class of convex problems in decentralized control. As an example, we show that optimal stabilizing controllers may be efficiently computed in the case where distributed controllers can communicate faster than their dynamics propagate. We also show that symmetric synthesis is included in this classification, and provide a test for sparsity constraints to be quadratically invariant, and thus amenable to convex synthesis.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2005.860365","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1593901","Convex optimization;decentralized control;delayed control;extended linear spaces;networked control","Distributed control;Control systems;Optimal control;Automatic control;Feedback;Network synthesis;Space vehicles;Error correction;Quadratic programming;Distributed computing","","Convex optimization;decentralized control;delayed control;extended linear spaces;networked control","","407","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the basic dc link single current sensor technique poses special challenges because the duration of the active voltage vectors must be long enough to measure the dc link current reliably during every pulsewidth modulation switching interval. A new single current sensor algorithm for reconstructing the phase currents called the measurement vector insertion method (MVIM) is presented that overcomes this problem using active voltage vectors that are applied for brief measurement intervals only when needed during each fundamental frequency cycle. The insertion of measurement vectors makes it possible to reconstruct the output phase currents with minimum impact on the machine's performance and operating envelope.

"LPI radar: fact or fiction","D. C. Schleher","Naval Postgraduate Sch., Camano Island, WA, USA","IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","","2006","21","5","3","6","LPI radar is a system that consists of a radar and ES system. Its performance depends on both components. An LPI performance factor is derived and applied to several examples. Operational LPI radars are described. A digital LPI radar detector is described and test results presented. A recent book on LPI radar received a number of somewhat critical reviews that were published in Systems magazine. Although these reviews made a number of excellent points, several questioned the existence of LPI radar. The objectives of this article are to provide a sound technical basis for determining LPI properties of radar, examine several radars that have LPI qualities, and then to describe digital LPI radar detector designed and tested against the PILOT Mk2 radar. LPI radar is a system that represents a confluence between radar and electronic support (ES) technology. The objective of LPI radar is clear; that is, to escape detection by the ES receiver. However, the capability of the LPI radar system depends upon the characteristics of both the radar and ES receiver. To understand LPI radar one must first understand the nature of ES receivers. The functions performed by tactical ES receivers are immediate interception, identification, and location of both friendly and hostile emitters. Location requires interception in the emitter's sidelobes. Identification is performed by comparing the intercepted signature against the signatures contained within its threat library (Schelher, 1999). The metric that establishes the quality of interception is called the probability of intercept (POI) and is generally included in its specifications (Schleher, 1999). From the above discussion it is evident that radar might have LPI properties with respect to one type, but not to another type of ES system. This situation can be clarified if the claim of radar being LPI radar is accompanied by a description of the various types of ES systems for which this claim applies. However the LPI radar can never completely escape detection since there is always a minimum range (R/sub ES/) between the ES system and radar where the interception receiver detection threshold is exceeded.","1557-959X","","10.1109/MAES.2006.1635166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1635166","","Radar detection;Radar cross section;Detectors;Radar antennas;Radar applications;Marine vehicles;Pulse measurements;Frequency;Acoustic testing;Libraries","military radar;radar detection;radar receivers","ES system;digital LPI radar detector;PILOT Mk2 radar;electronic support technology;escape detection;ES receiver;emitter sidelobe interception;interception receiver detection","","50","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This is achieved by replacing the high-frequency asymptotic requirement of the VF scaling function with a more relaxed condition. Calculated results demonstrate a major improvement of performance when fitting responses that are contaminated with noise. The procedure is also shown to be advantageous for wideband modeling of transmission lines, network equivalents, and transformers.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2005.860281","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1645204","Macromodel;rational approximation;system identification;vector fitting (VF)","Convergence;Vectors;Function approximation;System identification;Power system modeling;Frequency response;Senior members;Wideband;Power transmission lines;Transformers","rational functions;function approximation;frequency-domain analysis;power transformers;transmission network calculations","pole relocating properties;vector fitting procedure;rational function approximation;frequency-domain response;high-frequency asymptotic requirement;VF scaling function;transmission lines;network equivalents;transformers","","379","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper will address the development of a lower limb exoskeleton legs for force augmentation and active assistive walking training. The twin wearable legs are powered by pneumatic muscle actuators (pMAs), an experimental low mass high power to weight and volume actuation system. In addition, the pMA being pneumatic produces a more natural muscle like contact and as such can be considered a soft and biomimetic actuation system. This capacity to ""replicate"" the function of natural muscle and inherent safety is extremely important when working in close proximity to humans.

These rectifiers draw significant harmonic currents from the utility, resulting in poor input power factor with high total harmonic distortion (THD). In this paper, a digitally controlled three-phase switch mode power supply based on a matrix converter is proposed for telecommunication applications. In the proposed approach, the matrix converter directly converts the low frequency (50/60Hz, three-phase) input to a high frequency (10/20kHz, one-phase) ac output without a dc-link. The output of the matrix converter is then processed via a high frequency isolation transformer to produce -48V dc. Digital control of the system ensures that the output voltage is regulated and the input currents are of high quality under varying load conditions. Due to the absence of dc-link electrolytic capacitors, power density of the proposed rectifier is expected to be higher. Analysis, design example and experimental results are presented from a three-phase 208-V, 1.5-kW laboratory prototype converter.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2005.861197","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1566697","Three-phase switch mode rectifier;total harmonic distortion (THD)","Switches;Digital control;Power supplies;Matrix converters;Telecommunication switching;Rectifiers;Frequency conversion;Telecommunication control;DC-DC power converters;Power system harmonics","digital control;switched mode power supplies;switching convertors;matrix convertors;harmonic distortion;telecommunication power supplies;DC-DC power convertors;rectifying circuits;power factor;electrolytic capacitors;power engineering computing","switch mode power supply digital control;matrix converter;high power telecommunication power supply systems;three-phase switch mode rectifiers;DC-DC converter;harmonic currents;THD;total harmonic distortion;power factor;isolation transformer;voltage regulation;DC-link electrolytic capacitors;power density;50 Hz;60 Hz;10 kHz;20 kHz;208 V;1.5 kW","","55","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The system uses facial motion to characterize monochrome frontal views of facial expressions and is able to operate effectively in cluttered and dynamic scenes, recognizing the six emotions universally associated with unique facial expressions, namely happiness, sadness, disgust, surprise, fear, and anger. Faces are located using a spatial ratio template tracker algorithm. Optical flow of the face is subsequently determined using a real-time implementation of a robust gradient model. The expression recognition system then averages facial velocity information over identified regions of the face and cancels out rigid head motion by taking ratios of this averaged motion. The motion signatures produced are then classified using Support Vector Machines as either nonexpressive or as one of the six basic emotions.

"Consensus based formation control strategies for multi-vehicle systems","Wei Ren","Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Utah State Univ., Logan, UT, USA","2006 American Control Conference","","2006","","","6 pp.","","In this paper we first introduce a fundamental consensus algorithm for systems modeled by second-order dynamics. We then apply variants of the consensus algorithm to tackle formation control problems by appropriately choosing information states on which consensus is reached.

The FinFET device structure is an attractive double-gate structure and most compatible with today's standard processing technologies. One of the challenging issues of fabricating FinFETs device is how to form the FinFET's source-drain junction in the Fin area and develop metrology techniques to measure it. In this paper, we discuss the challenges of implanting ultra-thin fins and metrology development for measuring Fin doping concentration. Our simulation results demonstrate that a high angle of implantation at a certain energy is needed to maximize the dopant distribution in the Fin. Raman microscopy has been developed as a Fin doping measurement metrology. To ease the junction diffusion under the gate and reduce off current dispersion, a gate-source/drain underlap FinFET structure is investigated to make FinFET junction formation more manufacturable.

It would be valuable to know how object-oriented design metrics and class fault-proneness are related when fault severity is taken into account. In this paper, we use logistic regression and machine learning methods to empirically investigate the usefulness of object-oriented design metrics, specifically, a subset of the Chidamber and Kemerer suite, in predicting fault-proneness when taking fault severity into account. Our results, based on a public domain NASA data set, indicate that 1) most of these design metrics are statistically related to fault-proneness of classes across fault severity, and 2) the prediction capabilities of the investigated metrics greatly depend on the severity of faults.

This change will require new access networks that support high-speed (> 100 Mb/s), symmetric, and guaranteed bandwidths for future video services with high-definition TV quality. To satisfy the required bandwidth over a 20-km transmission distance, single-mode optical fiber is currently the only practical choice. To minimize the cost of implementing an FTTP solution, a passive optical network (PON) that uses a point-to-multipoint architecture is generally considered to be the best approach. There are several multiple-access techniques to share a single PON architecture, and the authors addressed several of these approaches such as time-division multiple access, wavelength-division multiple access, subcarrier multiple access, and code-division multiple access. Among these multiple techniques, they focus on time-division multiplexing (TDM)-PON and wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM)-PON, which will be the most promising candidates for practical future systems. A TDM-PON shares a single-transmission channel with multiple subscribers in time domain. Then, there exists tight coupling between subscribers. A WDM-PON provides point-to-point optical connectivity using a dedicated pair of wavelengths per user. While a TDM-PON appears to be a satisfactory solution for current bandwidth demands, the combination of future data-rate projections and traffic patterns coupled with recent advances in WDM technology may result in WDM-PON becoming the preferred solution for a future proof fiber-based access network","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2006.885779","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4063414","Fiber to the home (FTTH);fiber to the premise (FTTP);optical access network;passive optical network (PON)","Passive optical networks;Bandwidth;Telecommunication traffic;Wavelength division multiplexing;High definition video;HDTV;Optical fibers;Costs;Multiaccess communication;WDM networks","code division multiple access;optical fibre subscriber loops;quality of service;telecommunication channels;telecommunication traffic;time division multiple access;time division multiplexing;wavelength division multiplexing","fiber-to-the home;passive optical networks;traffic patterns;access networks;voice-oriented services;text-oriented services;video-based services;image-based services;high-definition television;single-mode optical fiber;point-to-multipoint architecture;multiple-access techniques;time-division multiple access;wavelength-division multiple access;subcarrier multiple access;code-division multiple access;time-division multiplexing;wavelength-division multiplexing;point-to-point optical connectivity;data-rate projections;fiber-based access network;20 km","","295","","44","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper describes a novel unsupervised, information-theoretic, adaptive filter (UINTA) that improves the predictability of pixel intensities from their neighborhoods by decreasing their joint entropy. In this way, UINTA automatically discovers the statistical properties of the signal and can thereby restore a wide spectrum of images.

The use of FC technology for electricity and heat generation for residential applications generated tremendous interest. Proton exchange membrane FCs (PEMFCs) are attractive for residential use due to its low operating temperature and fast startup characteristics. This paper focuses on the modeling, control (voltage and active power control), and simulation of PEMFC-based power supply system for residential applications. A proportional-integral (PI)-type voltage and real power controller is usually implemented by controlling the fuel input into FC stack and adjusting the inverter modulation index. Furthermore, power-quality issues are evaluated based on the transformer connection type and harmonic content of the load for household appliances. Detailed simulation software has been developed using the Matlab software package. The topology chosen for the simulation consists of a 5-kW PEMFC, a single-stage-voltage-sourced pulsewidth-modulation inverter followed by an LC filter and a step-up transformer. The simulation results illustrate that the voltage at the load point and active power demand versus load variations can be achieved using the PI controller. The control parameters used involves inverter modulation index and phase angle. The power-quality evaluation confirms that the bus voltage harmonics meet the IEEE-519 requirements for all home appliances, which are modeled based on real measured values.

We specifically address important emulation requirements such as fault representativeness and emulation accuracy. We start with the analysis of an extensive collection of real software faults. We observed that a large percentage of faults falls into well-defined classes and can be characterized in a very precise way, allowing accurate emulation of software faults through a small set of emulation operators. A new software fault injection technique (G-SWFIT) based on emulation operators derived from the field study is proposed. This technique consists of finding key programming structures at the machine code-level where high-level software faults can be emulated. The fault-emulation accuracy of this technique is shown.

"Experience with distribution transformer loading and failure prediction","D. Henderson","Itron Inc., Boston, MA, USA","2006 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","","2006","","","1 pp.","","Summary form only given. Utilities have used for years indicators such as loading, hot spot and top oil temperatures to determine ratings and health of substation transformers where the required data is readily available. However, the same level of data is not available for low voltage distribution transformers and loading prediction is difficult. Overload failures of distribution transformers, while not particularly significant to the utility network, can strain maintenance budgets, drain resources and sour customer relationships. Typically utilities use a transformer load management program that aggregates customer usage, estimates a peak and aggregates the peaks to a transformer for determining transformer load. Transformer replacement programs will then use loading as an indicator of replacement priority. However, most utilities have many more overloaded distribution transformers than they can economically replace, and predicting transformer failure is a very inexact science. One cause among several is poor data quality. Yet estimating loading requires good customer to transformer connectivity data and validated usage data at a minimum. We presented here one utility's experience with a continuous program of proactive distribution transformer replacements based on continuous calculation of loading from end use data. This program was the result of an alarming rate of transformer failures experience during several recent hot summers. Byproducts of this program were the recognition that loading alone is not a good indicator of potential outage, and that transformer age appears to have little or no correlation with transformer outages. Three consecutive years of locating and proactively replacing transformers that are likely to cause a transformer outage were presented including: data sources; methods; analysis; results to date; issues; conclusions to date. Calculated loading on actually failed distribution transformers was compared with loading of a large control group of not, or not-yet failed, distribution transformers, showing a clear correlation of calculated loading with probability of transformer failure","1932-5517","1-4244-0493-2","10.1109/PES.2006.1709652","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1709652","","Oil insulation;Aggregates;Petroleum;Temperature;Substations;Low voltage;Capacitive sensors;Load management;Economic forecasting;Economic indicators","distribution networks;failure analysis;power transformers","distribution transformer loading;substation transformers;overload failures;transformer load management program;transformer load determination;transformer replacement programs;overloaded distribution transformers;transformer failure prediction;proactive distribution transformer replacements;transformer failure probability","","1","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The idea in this strategy is to form an energy-like Lyapunov function in terms of the active filter states and then determine the control law that makes the time derivative of the Lyapunov function always negative for all values of the states. It is shown that a globally stable control is possible at the expense of a time-varying reference function for the direct current (dc) capacitor voltage. This method, however, requires the estimation or measurement of the harmonic ripple component on the dc capacitor voltage. Therefore, a modified control is proposed by ignoring this ripple component. The active filter's current reference is obtained by subtracting the measured load current from the generated supply current reference. The amplitude of the supply current reference can be adjusted by using a proportional-integral (PI) controller that regulates the dc capacitor voltage. Experimental results that are obtained for steady-state operation and step changes in the load are presented to verify the correct operation of the proposed control strategy.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2005.862218","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1589390","Lyapunov-based control;shunt active power filters (APFs)","Active filters;Lyapunov method;Capacitors;Voltage control;Current supplies;Power harmonic filters;Current measurement;Pi control;Proportional control;Steady-state","power harmonic filters;active filters;Lyapunov methods;PI control;voltage control","single-phase shunt active power filter;Lyapunov stability theory;time-varying reference function;direct current capacitor voltage;harmonic ripple measurement;proportional-integral controller;DC voltage regulation","","99","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These constraints are largely driven by the image acquisition process, rather than the particular pattern-matching algorithm used for the recognition process. In this paper we present results of our efforts to substantially reduce constraints on position and motion by means of a new image acquisition system based on high-resolution cameras, video synchronized strobed illumination, and specularity based image segmentation. We discuss the design tradeoffs we made in developing the system and the performance we have been able to achieve when the image acquisition system is combined with a standard iris recognition algorithm.

It is difficult since often the decision for an edge cannot be made purely based on low level cues such as gradient, instead we need to engage all levels of information, low, middle, and high, in order to decide where to put edges. In this paper we propose a novel supervised learning algorithm for edge and object boundary detection which we refer to as Boosted Edge Learning or BEL for short. A decision of an edge point is made independently at each location in the image; a very large aperture is used providing significant context for each decision. In the learning stage, the algorithm selects and combines a large number of features across different scales in order to learn a discriminative model using an extended version of the Probabilistic Boosting Tree classification algorithm. The learning based framework is highly adaptive and there are no parameters to tune. We show applications for edge detection in a number of specific image domains as well as on natural images.

Forty organizations participated in the study and described how they implement ISO 14001 requirements. They also reported how the standard impacts on their environmental and business performance. The results show that if ISO 14001 requirements become part of the organization's daily practices, then standardization of the organization's handling of environmental issues follows-leading, consequently, to better organizational environmental performance. In addition, standardization augments its effect on organizational environmental performance through its positive impact on employee discretion. Allowing employees discretion further improves environmental performance. We saw that discretion partially mediates the effect of standardization on environmental performance. Analysis of survey and financial data did not reveal any support for the hypothesis that achieving improvement in environmental performance as result of ISO 14001 implementation leads to better business performance; on the other hand, we saw that business performance was not harmed","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2006.883704","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1715643","Business performance;discretion;environmental management systems;environmental performance;ISO 14001;standardization","Environmental management;Standards organizations;Organizations;ISO Standards","environmental management;ISO standards;organisational aspects;standardisation","standardization;ISO 14001 standard;environmental management standard;business activities;organization daily practices;organizational environmental performance;employees discretion","","131","","83","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Efficient quantum-logic circuits that perform two tasks are discussed: 1) implementing generic quantum computations, and 2) initializing quantum registers. In contrast to conventional computing, the latter task is nontrivial because the state space of an n-qubit register is not finite and contains exponential superpositions of classical bitstrings. The proposed circuits are asymptotically optimal for respective tasks and improve earlier published results by at least a factor of 2. The circuits for generic quantum computation constructed by the algorithms are the most efficient known today in terms of the number of most expensive gates [quantum controlled-NOTs (CNOTs)]. They are based on an analog of the Shannon decomposition of Boolean functions and a new circuit block, called quantum multiplexor (QMUX), which generalizes several known constructions. A theoretical lower bound implies that the circuits cannot be improved by more than a factor of 2. It is additionally shown how to accommodate the severe architectural limitation of using only nearest neighbor gates, which is representative of current implementation technologies. This increases the number of gates by almost an order of magnitude, but preserves the asymptotic optimality of gate counts.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2005.855930","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1629135","Application specific integrated circuits;circuit analysis;circuit optimization;circuit synthesis;circuit topology;design automation;logic design;matrix decompositions;quantum effect semiconductor devices;quantum theory","Circuit synthesis;Quantum computing;Design automation;Optimized production technology;Registers;Electronic design automation and methodology;Circuit testing;Automatic testing;State-space methods;Boolean functions","Boolean functions;high level synthesis;logic design;quantum gates","quantum-logic circuit synthesis;generic quantum computations;quantum registers;quantum controlled-NOT gates;Shannon decomposition;Boolean functions;quantum multiplexor","","167","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Discrete SJ vertical power devices have recently become available commercially. However, lateral SJ devices have not materialized for several years partly due to the fact that the lateral SJ structure, implemented on silicon substrates, suffers from substrate-assisted depletion effects which reduce the breakdown voltage. This article discusses the various device structures that have been proposed to eliminate the substrate-assisted depletion effects in SJ-lateral double diffused MOS LDMOS transistors (SJ-LDMOSTs). The concept of the SJ device and vertical and lateral SJ structure was summarized. The substrate-assisted depletion effects are described in detail.

None of the existing resource allocation algorithms in wireless ad hoc networks have realistically considered end-to-end flows spanning multiple hops. Moreover, strategies proposed in wireline networks are not applicable in the context of wireless ad hoc networks, due to their unique characteristics of location-dependent contention. In this paper, we propose a new price-based resource allocation framework in wireless ad hoc networks to achieve optimal resource utilization and fairness among competing end-to-end flows. We build our pricing framework on the notion of maximal cliques in wireless ad hoc networks, as compared to individual links in traditional wide-area wireline networks. Based on such a price-based theoretical framework, we present a two-tier iterative algorithm. Distributed across wireless nodes, the algorithm converges to a global network optimum with respect to resource allocations. We further improve the algorithm toward asynchronous network settings and prove its convergence. Extensive simulations under a variety of network environments have been conducted to validate our theoretical claims.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2006.1599404","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1599404","Wireless communication;algorithm/protocol design and analysis;nonlinear programming.","Resource management;Intelligent networks;Ad hoc networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Pricing;Peer to peer computing;Spread spectrum communication;Algorithm design and analysis;Iterative algorithms;Wireless networks","resource allocation;ad hoc networks;pricing;iterative methods","optimal resource allocation;wireless ad hoc networks;price-based approach;resource utilization;network flows;end-to-end flows;two-tier iterative algorithm;asynchronous network","","126","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The array consists of an n/2xn/2 array of 2x2 processor elements to compute the SVD of an nxn matrix. The trigonometric functions and the vector multiplication in the algorithm are tailored to the use of CORDIC (coordinate rotation digital computer) algorithms for hardware-efficient solutions.

The algorithms to decompose the matrix were first evaluated in Matlab and then the processors were implemented using the Virtex-II FPGA from Xilinx as the target device. The basic SVD processor utilizes the proposed mesh-connected array structure and CORDIC algorithm. The implementation concentrates on utilizing the features of the FPGA to speed up operations and reduce the area required.

Based on the protocol, the overall energy consumption per packet transmission is modeled and the optimal set of transmission parameters is found. Then, the issues of ETE QoS provisioning of the protocol are considered. The ETE latency and throughput of the protocol are modeled in terms of the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of each link. Then, a nonlinear constrained programming model is developed to find the optimal BER performance of each link to meet the ETE QoS requirements with a minimum energy consumption.

To find the reason for the improvement, bias dependent nonlinear parameters of the test devices are extracted from a small-signal model and a Volterra series analysis for an optimized nMOS PA with a proper matching circuit is carried out. From the analysis, it is revealed that the DNW of the nMOS lowers the harmonic distortion generated from the intrinsic gate-source capacitance (C/sub gs/), which is the dominant nonlinear source, and partially from drain junction capacitance (C/sub jd/). Single-ended and differential PAs for 2.45-GHz WLAN are designed and fabricated using a 0.18-/spl mu/m standard CMOS process. The single-ended PA with the DNW improves IMD3 and IMD5 about 5 dB with identical power performances, i.e., 20 dBm of P/sub out/, 18.7 dB of power gain and 31% of power-added efficiency (PAE) at P/sub 1dB/.

The general result is applicable to both symbol-based and bit-interleaved coded modulations, to HARQ processes based on rateless and fixed-rate mother codes, and IR schemes with and without a self-decodability restriction. The analysis shows that IR over CC coding gains tend to increase with the initial coding rate, but decrease with the signal-to-noise (SNR) variation between retransmissions. The gains can also be diminished when a fixed-rate mother code is used or when the self-decodability criterion is imposed. The theoretical prediction is compared with observed gains at 10% codeword error rates based on turbo-coding simulations. For scenarios with moderately varying SNR between retransmissions, the analytical model tracks actual simulation results very well. However, when the SNR varies widely and the systematic part of the turbo codeword is effectively erased, the CC scheme could, in fact, outperform some IR schemes. For these scenarios, which can be induced by fast time-varying fading or long retransmission delays, the self-decodable IR and the CC schemes prove to be more robust without much performance comprise.

This performance is compared against the stated benchmark of equivalent human performance, specifically the measured detection times of an alerted human observer. The two algorithms were used to process a series of image streams featuring real collision-course aircraft against a variety of daytime backgrounds. Preliminary analysis of this data set has yielded encouraging results, achieving first detection times at distances of approximately 6.5 km (3.5 nmi), which are 35-40% greater than those of the alerted human observer. Comparisons were also drawn between the two separate detection algorithms, and have demonstrated that a new approach designed to increase resilience to image noise achieves a lower rate of false alarms, particularly in tests featuring more sensitive detection thresholds","1050-4729","0-7803-9505-0","10.1109/ROBOT.2006.1642133","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1642133","","Image processing;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Humans;Computer vision;Algorithm design and analysis;Aircraft;Streaming media;FAA;Data analysis;Detection algorithms","aircraft;collision avoidance;mobile robots;remotely operated vehicles;robot vision;telerobotics","image processing algorithms;avoidance maneuvers;real-life collision scenario;real collision-course aircraft;alerted human observer;collision avoidance;unmanned aerial vehicles","","50","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One such representation that has been frequently used in the past are elevation maps which store in each cell of a discrete grid the height of the surface in the corresponding area. Whereas elevation maps provide a compact representation, they lack the ability to represent vertical structures or even multiple levels. In this paper, we propose a new representation denoted as multi-level surface maps (MLS maps). Our approach allows to store multiple surfaces in each cell of the grid. This enables a mobile robot to model environments with structures like bridges, underpasses, buildings or mines. Additionally, they allow to represent vertical structures. Throughout this paper we present algorithms for updating these maps based on sensory input, to match maps calculated from two different scans, and to solve the loop-closing problem given such maps.

However, a tradeoff arises between the antenna size and the radiation gain. In this paper, an antenna that has a high radiation gain and yet is compact in size is proposed for the rectenna named c-shaped u-slot coaxial-fed microstrip antenna. The proposed antenna in comparison of the inset-fed square patch antenna, not only has physical dimensions 32% less than square patch antenna, but also it has a gain of 6.96 dBi, while the gain of the square patch one is 2.677 dBi. Hence, its characteristics are comparable to several element antenna array, but an extra feeding network is not required and the system is compact. Also, the concept of the active integrated antenna (AIA) is used to design an efficient rectenna. Under this concept the antenna can provide certain circuit functions such as resonating, filtering, duplexing and harmonic rejection, in addition to its original role as a radiating element. Our proposed antenna is a kind of AIA that has the harmonic rejection characteristic. Therefore the matching circuits and the band-pass filter (BPF) are not needed for the proposed design. Because a c-shaped u-slot antenna in the rectenna can suppress the 2nd and 3rd harmonics, the harmonic rejection BPF can be removed. Moreover the impedance of the rectifying circuit is matched to the input impedance of the c-shaped u-slot antenna using a coaxial feed and finding a proper point on the surface of the antenna without matching circuit","1947-1491","1-4244-0123-2","10.1109/APS.2006.1711031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1711031","","Rectennas;Power harmonic filters;Band pass filters;Microstrip antennas;Antenna feeds;Circuits;Antenna arrays;Coaxial components;Patch antennas;Surface impedance","active antennas;antenna feeds;interference suppression;microstrip antennas;slot antennas","active integrated antenna based rectenna;probe-fed U-slot antenna;harmonic rejection;radiation gain;c-shaped u-slot coaxial-fed microstrip antenna;inset-fed square patch antenna;antenna array","","","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, jointly optimizing resource allocation across adjacent and even nonadjacent layers of the protocol stack leads to dramatic improvement in overall system performance. In this article we provide an overview of recent research on dynamic resource allocation, especially for MIMO and OFDM systems.

Assuming no changes in receiver structure, the transmitter can only reduce PAR by distorting the data carriers or by adding power to the free carriers. This paper shows that the OFDM signal with globally minimum PAR, subject to constraints on the allowed constellation error and the free carrier power, can be efficiently computed using convex optimization. Simulation results are presented for the 802.11a/g wireless local-area network standard. The globally minimum PAR, subject to the constellation error constraint, ranges from 0.7 dB for 6-Mbps binary phase-shift keying to 4.1 dB for 54-Mbps 64-QAM. Tradeoff analysis shows that the free carrier power can be drastically reduced by backing off from this globally minimum PAR by less than 1 dB. A customized interior-point method (IPM) is derived for solving the OFDM optimization problem. The IPM reaches the desired tradeoff between PAR and free carrier power within two iterations, where the main computational complexity per iteration is four fast Fourier transforms plus the solution of a linear system of equations.

However, they never received a proper formal semantics, which is the hallmark of precision and unambiguity as well as a prerequisite for efficient and safe tool automation, In this paper, we first survey FD variants. Subsequently, we generalize the various syntaxes through a generic construction called free feature diagrams (FFD). Formal semantics is defined at the FFD level, which provides unambiguous definition for ail the surveyed FD variants in one shot. All formalisation choices found a clear answer in the original FODA FD definition, which proved that although informal and scattered throughout many pages, it suffered no ambiguity problem. Our definition has several additional advantages: it is formal, concise and generic.

It is an important and challenging issue to support seamless handoff management in this integrated architecture. The existing handoff management protocols are not sufficient to guarantee handoff support that is transparent to the applications in NGWS. In this work, a cross-layer (layer 2 + 3) handoff management protocol, CHMP, is developed to support seamless intra and intersystem handoff management in NGWS. Cross-layer handoff management protocol uses mobile's speed and handoff signaling delay information to enhance the handoff performance of mobile IP that is proposed to support mobility management in wireless IP networks. First, the handoff performance of mobile IP is analyzed with respect to its sensitivity to the link layer (layer 2) and network layer (layer 3) parameters. Then, a cross-layer handoff management architecture is developed using the insights learnt from the analysis. Based on this architecture, the detailed design of CHMP is carried out. Finally, extensive simulation experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of CHMP. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show that CHMP significantly enhances the performance of both intra and intersystem handoffs","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2006.142","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1683785","Next-generation wireless systems;handoff management;cross-layer protocol design;ubiquitous communications.","Wireless application protocol;Mobile communication;Mobile radio mobility management;Next generation networking;Performance analysis;Switches;Birth disorders;Wireless networks;Wireless sensor networks;IP networks","computer network management;IP networks;mobile computing;mobility management (mobile radio)","cross-layer handoff management protocol;layer 2 + 3 handoff management protocol;next-generation wireless systems;wireless networks;ubiquitous communications;CHMP;intersystem handoff management;handoff signaling delay information;mobile IP;mobility management;wireless IP networks;link layer parameter;network layer parameter","","144","","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Under certain pulsed application conditions, the required amount of current cycles the product must survive is so high that not just low cycle fatigue, caused by cyclic plastic deformation, but also high cycle fatigue becomes a concern. This paper describes how in-situ monitored power cycling experiments, using the Joule heating of the bond wires, were performed on dedicated test structures at different stress levels with wire loop shapes and test settings critical enough to find failures within reasonable test times. Wire bond settings were varied to create different amounts of initial damage as introduced by the plastic deformation of the heel and the wedge. Finite element method was employed to calculate the stress amplitude in the heel of the bond wire in the experiments as function of current, pulse time and loop shape. This required a multi-physics approach using coupled electro-thermal and sequentially coupled thermo-mechanical simulations. The amount of initial damage was also estimated, using 2D FE simulations, in order to quantitatively take into account the initial plastic strains. With the measured failure times (Nf) and calculated stress amplitude (S) the durability or S-N curves for different amounts of initial damage could be derived and fitted with the Basquin model. These fitted models were used to predict the expected lifetime for specified field conditions. Furthermore the models can be used to derive `design for reliability rules' for wire loop shapes that will survive a specified user profile","","1-4244-0275-1","10.1109/ESIME.2006.1644022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1644022","","Fatigue;Aluminum;Bonding;Wires;Physics;Predictive models;Plastics;Testing;Shape;Thermal stresses","aluminium;ceramic packaging;fatigue;finite element analysis;lead bonding;materials testing;plastic deformation;thermal stresses","high cycle fatigue;aluminum bond wires;multiphysics simulations;ceramic air cavity package;mechanical fatigue;temperature cycling;power cycling;current cycles;cyclic plastic deformation;Joule heating;stress levels;wire bond settings;finite element method;coupled electro-thermal simulations;coupled thermo-mechanical simulations;plastic strains;Basquin model;design for reliability","","19","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Central pattern generators are biological neural networks that can produce coordinated multidimensional rhythmic signals, under the control of simple input signals. They are found both in vertebrate and invertebrate animals for the control of locomotion. In this article, we present a novel system composed of coupled adaptive nonlinear oscillators that can learn arbitrary rhythmic signals in a supervised learning framework. Using adaptive rules implemented as differential equations, parameters such as intrinsic frequencies, amplitudes, and coupling weights are automatically adjusted to replicate a teaching signal. Once the teaching signal is removed, the trajectories remain embedded as the limit cycle of the dynamical system. An interesting aspect of this approach is that the learning is completely embedded into the dynamical system, and does not require external optimization algorithms. We use our system to encapsulate rhythmic trajectories for biped locomotion with a simulated humanoid robot, and demonstrate how it can be used to do online trajectory generation. The system can modulate the speed of locomotion, and even allow the reversal of direction (i.e. walking backwards). The integration of sensory feedback allows the online modulation of trajectories such as to increase the basin of stability of the gaits, and therefore the range of speeds that can be produced","1050-4729","0-7803-9505-0","10.1109/ROBOT.2006.1641933","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1641933","","Legged locomotion;Centralized control;Couplings;Oscillators;Humanoid robots;Education;Nonlinear control systems;Control systems;Signal generators;Biological neural networks","control engineering computing;humanoid robots;legged locomotion;neurocontrollers;position control;stability","biped locomotion control;programmable central pattern generators;coupled nonlinear oscillators;humanoid robot;biological neural networks;coordinated multidimensional rhythmic signals;coupled adaptive nonlinear oscillators;differential equations;intrinsic frequencies;coupling weights;dynamical system;biped locomotion;sensory feedback;gaits stability","","126","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The current time series analysis methods generally assume that the series at hand have sufficient length to apply statistical techniques to them. Other ideal case assumptions are that data are collected in equal length intervals, and while comparing time series, the lengths are usually expected to be equal to each other. However, these assumptions are not valid for many real data sets, especially for the clinical trials data sets. An addition, the data sources are different from each other, the data are heterogeneous, and the sensitivity of the experiments varies by the source. Approaches for mining time series data need to be revisited, keeping the wide range of requirements in mind. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for information mining that involves two major steps: applying a data mining algorithm over homogeneous subsets of data, and identifying common or distinct patterns over the information gathered in the first step. Our approach is implemented specifically for heterogeneous and high dimensional time series clinical trials data. Using this framework, we propose a new way of utilizing frequent itemset mining, as well as clustering and declustering techniques with novel distance metrics for measuring similarity between time series data. By clustering the data, we find groups of analytes (substances in blood) that are most strongly correlated. Most of these relationships already known are verified by the clinical panels, and, in addition, we identify novel groups that need further biomedical analysis. A slight modification to our algorithm results an effective declustering of high dimensional time series data, which is then used for ""feature selection.""

Due to the spatial correlation between sensor nodes subject to observed events, it may not be necessary for every sensor node to transmit its data. This paper shows how the spatial correlation can be exploited on the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort which exploits spatial correlation in WSN on the MAC layer. A theoretical framework is developed for transmission regulation of sensor nodes under a distortion constraint. It is shown that a sensor node can act as a representative node for several other sensor nodes observing the correlated data. Based on the theoretical framework, a distributed, spatial Correlation-based Collaborative Medium Access Control (CC-MAC) protocol is then designed which has two components: Event MAC (E-MAC) and Network MAC (N-MAC). E-MAC filters out the correlation in sensor records while N-MAC prioritizes the transmission of route-thru packets.

It has become common place for vehicles to rely on electrical power, in whole or in part, for all systems, including critical systems such as flight control and fuel delivery. Microprocessors embedded in digitally controlled power distribution systems, as well as in the digital controllers within these systems, provide an unprecedented, affordable and inherent opportunity to monitor an electrically powered vehicle's systems health. Data transmitted to and from these controllers can be used to characterize the system and component operating signatures, thereby enabling advanced diagnostic and prognostic capabilities. These capabilities will ensure a high mission reliability rate as well as reduce life cycle ownership costs. The aircraft electrical power systems prognostics and health management (AEPHM) program, presently being worked by Air Force Research Laboratories (AFRL), Boeing, and Smiths Aerospace, has developed and demonstrated health management (diagnostics, prognostics and decision aids) algorithms. The first phase of the program, which ended in July of 2005, addressed electric actuation, fuel pumps/valves and arc fault protection. The second phase is addressing power generation. Algorithm development is based on data collected from seeded and accelerated run-to-failure laboratory testing. The AEPHM architecture supports system level fusion of evidence and state information from multiple sources to improve estimates of degradation.

Each element in the linear array consists of a woodpile EBG sectoral horn antenna. The electromagnetic confinement mechanism within each horn antenna relies wholly on the 3-D EBG of the woodpile material. The array element has a typical sectoral horn pattern with a directional beam in one principal plane and a broader beam in the other. The bandwidth of the sectoral horn is almost equal to that of the defect EBG waveguide. Measured and theoretical results for radiation patterns, impedance bandwidth and gain of a sectoral horn antenna made from alumina are described, and theoretical results for a design made from silicon are presented. It is shown that the layer-by-layer nature of the woodpile EBG material enables sectoral horn antennas to be easily stacked together in the E-plane to create linear arrays. Analysis of the mutual coupling as a function of element separation and its effect on reflection coefficient are presented for a two-element linear array in silicon. Theoretical analyses for fixed and scanned beam linear arrays of silicon woodpile EBG sectoral horns are described and finite-difference time-domain results are compared with array theory. The fixed beam arrays are designed for high directivity while the scanned beam array enables wide angle beam steering through the use of parasitic array elements","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2006.879181","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1668300","Array antenna;electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) antenna;electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) waveguide;electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) material;finite-difference time-domain (FDTD);horn antenna;terahertz;three-dimensional (3-D) photonic crystal","Linear antenna arrays;Horn antennas;Periodic structures;Metamaterials;Silicon;Bandwidth;Stacking;Electromagnetic waveguides;Antenna measurements;Impedance measurement","antenna radiation patterns;beam steering;finite difference time-domain analysis;horn antennas;linear antenna arrays;photonic band gap;waveguides","linear array antennas;woodpile EBG sectoral horn antennas;natural stacking sequence;woodpile electromagnetic bandgap material;electromagnetic confinement mechanism;3D EBG;sectoral horn pattern;directional beam;defect EBG waveguide;radiation patterns;impedance bandwidth;element separation;reflection coefficient;two-element linear array;scanned beam linear arrays;silicon woodpile EBG sectoral horns;finite-difference time-domain analysis;array theory;fixed beam arrays;angle beam steering;parasitic array elements","","27","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many studies have been devoted to the control, sensing, and communication of robots. However, the deployment of robots has not been fully addressed. The deployment problem is to determine the number of groups unloaded by a carrier, the number of robots in each group, and the initial locations of those robots. This paper investigates robot deployment for coverage tasks. Both timing and energy constraints are considered; the robots carry limited energy and need to finish the tasks before deadlines. We build power models for mobile robots and calculate the robots' power consumption at different speeds. A speed-management method is proposed to decide the traveling speeds to maximize the traveling distance under both energy and timing constraints. Our method uses rectangle scanlines as the coverage routes, and solves the deployment problem using fewer robots. Finally, we provide an approach to consider areas with random obstacles. Compared with two simple heuristics, our solution uses 36% fewer robots for open areas and 32% fewer robots for areas with obstacles.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2006.875494","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1638342","Coverage;deployment;energy constraints;mobile robots;timing constraints","Mobile robots;Timing;Robot sensing systems;Cleaning;Robotics and automation;Earthquakes;Intelligent robots;Batteries;Landmine detection;Communication system control","mobile robots;multi-robot systems;velocity control","mobile robots deployment;energy constraints;timing constraints;speed-management method","","131","","50","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Importantly, it can also be used to show that slots in the PIFA top plate nominally provide series reactance when the slot opening is close to the feed. Understanding of this behavior allows bandwidth improvements to be realized.

In this paper, novel design of feedback gains of the observer is proposed to achieve the stability over the whole operation especially in the low-speed region, including the regenerating mode. Stability improvement using the proposed feedback gains is rigorously proven by the method of Lyapunov. For the adaptation proportional-integral (PI) gains, the ramp response characteristic of the speed estimator is proposed as design guidelines. It is revealed that the integral adaptation gain determines the tracking error of the speed estimator during acceleration/deceleration while the sensitivity to current measurement noises depends on the proportional adaptation gain. It is also pointed out that a suitable corner frequency of the adaptation PI gains is required as a design tradeoff to avoid an oscillation.

For example, how to design efficient THz antennas that are very different from the conventional antennas. There has been very little publication on this subject. This paper is aimed at addressing this problem. Due to how THz signals are generated, there are basically two types of THz antennas: the conventional antennas and photoconductive antennas . In THz region, the skin depth of a conductor is very small, thus conductive loss could be very high. Photoconductive antenna is the one attracted more attention and it seems to performance better. Normally a photoconductive antenna has a coplanar stripline structure. It consists of a semiconductor substrate and a coplanar stripline with a dipole antenna fabricated on the substrate. Some recent researchers observed that if being added the indentations at the edge of the dipole, the antenna can get a better performance on generating the signals. In this paper, we will not only compare various THz antennas, but also explain the reasons, such as why the indentations can improve the performance of the antenna. Some simulation results will also be provided to aid our discussion.","2164-3342","978-92-9092-937-6","10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584977","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4584977","","Dipole antennas;Biomedical optical imaging;Photoconductivity;Optical waveguides;Frequency;Coplanar waveguides;Signal generators;Stripline;Substrates;Microwave theory and techniques","coplanar waveguides;photoconducting devices;strip lines;submillimetre wave antennas","terahertz antennas;conventional antennas;photoconductive antennas;skin depth;coplanar stripline structure;indentations","","9","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This technique indirectly measures changes in local neuronal firing rates by measuring associated changes in deoxy-hemoglobin concentrations in nearby blood vessels. Based on the existing literature, it is impossible to make conclusive statements about the optimal algorithm and software implementations for any single preprocessing step, let alone entire pipelines. The author believes that the present focus on the technological testing of preprocessing steps should be balanced by approaches that test the pipeline. This should include all interactions measured using metrics that are closely linked to research and diagnostic questions addressed at the end of the processing pipeline. The goal is to avoid single expedient or default pipelines by developing a framework capable of potentially testing thousands of possible pipeline implementations per dataset. To achieve this goal, researchers depend on recent developments in software tools for managing neuroimaging workflows.","1937-4186","","10.1109/MEMB.2006.1607667","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607667","","Pipelines;Magnetic resonance imaging;Data analysis;Image processing;Books;Fluid flow measurement;Brain;Design for experiments;Sequences;Image reconstruction","biomedical MRI;medical image processing;blood;oxygen;brain;neurophysiology;blood vessels","fMRI preprocessing pipelines;blood-oxygenation-level-dependent fMRI;functional magnetic resonance imaging;local neuronal firing rates;deoxy-hemoglobin concentrations;blood vessels;optimal algorithm;software implementations;metrics;software tools;neuroimaging workflows","Algorithms;Animals;Brain;Brain;Brain Mapping;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Oxygen;Technology Assessment, Biomedical","77","","147","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In this paper, we present an adaptive duty cycling algorithm that allows energy harvesting sensor nodes to autonomously adjust their duty cycle according to the energy availability in the environment. The algorithm has three objectives, namely: (a) achieving energy neutral operation, i.e., energy consumption should not be more than the energy provided by the environment; (b) maximizing the system performance based on an application utility model subject to the above energy-neutrality constraint; and (c) adapting to the dynamics of the energy source at run-time. We present a model that enables harvesting sensor nodes to predict future energy opportunities based on historical data. We also derive an upper bound on the maximum achievable performance assuming perfect knowledge about the future behavior of the energy source. Our methods are evaluated using data gathered from a prototype solar energy harvesting platform and we show that our algorithm can utilize up to 58% more environmental energy compared to the case when harvesting-aware power management is not used","","1-59593-462-6","10.1145/1165573.1165616","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4271832","Algorithms;Design;Energy harvesting;low power design;energy neutral operation","Availability;Energy consumption;System performance;Runtime environment;Predictive models;Upper bound;Prototypes;Solar energy;Energy management;Environmental management","solar energy conversion;wireless sensor networks","adaptive duty cycling;energy harvesting systems;sensor networks;energy harvesting sensor nodes;duty cycle;energy neutral operation;energy consumption;application utility model;energy-neutrality constraint;solar energy harvesting platform","","53","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there are no concrete findings that actually discuss or evaluate the performance of a three-phase multilevel inverter. This paper presents some analysis on the performance of a 5-level cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverter (CHMI) based on a multi-carrier sinusoidal pulse width modulation (MSPWM) control technique. Performance analysis are made based on the results of a simulation study conducted on the operation of the CHMI using MATLAB/Simulink. The performance parameters chosen in the work include the waveform pattern, harmonic spectrum, fundamental value, and total harmonic distortion (THD) of the three-phase CHMI output voltage. From the results of the simulation study and the analysis conducted, several distinct features of the three-phase 5-level CHMI employing the MSPWM control scheme, in particular the phase disposition (PD) type of the carrier disposition (CD) method from the aspect of line voltage have been identified.","","1-4244-0273-5","10.1109/PECON.2006.346685","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4154529","Multilevel inverter;cascaded;three-phase;high power applications","Performance analysis;Pulse width modulation inverters;Voltage;Analytical models;Power system harmonics;Topology;Concrete;Pulse inverters;MATLAB;Total harmonic distortion","power conversion harmonics;pulse width modulation;PWM invertors;switching convertors","three-phase cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverter;high power applications;harmonic profile;power ratings;topology;multicarrier sinusoidal pulse width modulation control technique;simulation study;MATLAB;Simulink;waveform pattern;harmonic spectrum;total harmonic distortion;phase disposition;carrier disposition method;line voltage identification","","18","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Effective load-carrying capabilities (ELCC) obtained using the loss of load expectation (LOLE) and the loss of load frequency (LOLF) for a power system containing WECS are illustrated and compared. The results show that ELCC obtained using the LOLF and obtained using the LOLE for WECS can be considerably different, while they are similar for a conventional generating unit. The impact on the system reliability indices of wind speed correlation between two wind farms is also examined. The studies show that the degree of wind speed correlation between two wind farms has a considerable impact on the resulting reliability indices.

The 3MPLL also adaptively tracks and estimates the magnitude, phase angle, and frequency of the input signal; thus, its operation as a nonlinear state estimator. Characteristics of the 3MPLL including its mathematical equations as well as steady-state and dynamic responses are discussed in this paper. Comparisons are made between the proposed 3MPLL and conventional single-phase PLL (1PLL) and three-phase PLL (3PLL) systems. Advantages of the proposed system over the conventional methods and systems are also discussed. Structural simplicity and robustness of the 3MPLL system are its further features which make it desirable. In addition to the conventional applications of the 3PLL in the general area of power systems, the proposed 3MPLL can also be used for other applications which require smooth and adaptive synthesis of the instantaneous symmetrical components. Particularly, the 3MPLL can be used as a three-phase nonlinear anti-aliasing filter with no phase-shift and no amplitude bias. Three unique features of such a filter are frequency adaptivity, unbalance mitigation, and structural simplicity/robustness","1558-0806","","10.1109/TCSI.2006.879057","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1673648","Adaptive notch filter;anti-aliasing filter;frequency estimation;symmetrical components;synchronization;three-phase phase-locked loop (3PLL)","Frequency estimation;Phase estimation;State estimation;Phase locked loops;Robustness;Power electronics;Nonlinear distortion;Signal synthesis;Adaptive filters;Band pass filters","adaptive filters;frequency estimation;notch filters;phase estimation;phase locked loops","three-phase magnitude-phase-locked-loop system;adaptive notch filter;anti-aliasing filter;frequency estimation;magnitude estimation;phase angle estimation","","54","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To resolve two conflicting views on whether technology diversity or strategic focus can improve firm performance, we develop a scheme to measure the diversity of a patent portfolio at the two levels of broad technology diversity and core field diversity. In our framework, both views can be valid. The former argument is effective when the focal firm has very high technology stocks and profitability is used as a performance measure. The latter is true for a focal firm with above average technology stocks and where shareholder value is considered as a performance indicator. This paper highlights technology stocks as a moderator between the relationship of technology diversity and firm performance. Generally, a firm without very high-technology stocks should concentrate its R&D resources on a specific technology field, and even within the core technology field the firm should stay focus on a small number of core technologies. Results support the competence-based view of the firm. Technology-based firms should develop a portfolio with a clear technology focus. This study lays the groundwork for future study on the interrelationships of technology strategy, patent portfolio, and long-term performance.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2005.861813","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1580891","Patent portfolio;strategy;synergy;technology diversity","Patents","patents;organisational aspects;profitability;research and development","patent portfolio diversity;technology strategy;firm value;broad technology diversity;core field diversity;profitability;average technology stock;shareholder value;performance indicator;research and development resources;synergy","","99","","39","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Trajectory Free Linear Model Predictive Control for Stable Walking in the Presence of Strong Perturbations","P. Wieber","INRIA Rhône-Alpes, 38331 St Ismier Cedex, France. Email: Pierre-Brice.Wieber@inrialpes.fr","2006 6th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots","","2006","","","137","142","A humanoid walking robot is a highly nonlinear dynamical system that relies strongly on contact forces between its feet and the ground in order to realize stable motions, but these contact forces are unfortunately severely limited. Model predictive control, also known as receding horizon control, is a general control scheme specifically designed to deal with such constrained dynamical systems, with the potential ability to react efficiently to a wide range of situations. Apart from the question of computation time which needs to be taken care of carefully (these schemes can be highly computation intensive), the initial question of which optimal control problems should be considered to be solved online in order to lead to the desired walking movements is still unanswered. A key idea for answering to this problem can be found in the ZMP preview control scheme. After presenting here this scheme with a point of view slightly different from the original one, we focus on the problem of compensating strong perturbations of the dynamics of the robot and propose a new linear model predictive control scheme which is an improvement of the original ZMP preview control scheme.","2164-0580","1-4244-0199-2","10.1109/ICHR.2006.321375","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4115592","","Trajectory;Predictive models;Predictive control;Legged locomotion;Humanoid robots;Motion control;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Optimal control;Force control;Control systems","compensation;humanoid robots;infinite horizon;legged locomotion;motion control;nonlinear dynamical systems;predictive control;robot dynamics;stability","trajectory free linear model predictive control;walking stability;humanoid walking robot;nonlinear dynamical system;motion stability;contact forces;receding horizon control;constrained dynamical systems;optimal control;walking movement;ZMP preview control;perturbation compensation;robot dynamics","","244","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This new architecture, called companion model adaptive controller (CMAC), allows for incorporation of a low-pass filter into the feedback-loop that enables to enforce the desired transient performance by increasing the adaptation gain. For the proof of asymptotic stability, the Lscr1 gain of a cascaded system, comprised of this filter and the closed-loop desired reference model, is required to be less than the inverse of the upper bound of the norm of unknown parameters used in projection based adaptation laws.

But the core question of multirobot mapping is how to integrate the data of the different robots into a single global map. A significant amount of research exists in the area of multirobot mapping that deals with techniques to estimate the relative robots poses at the start or during the mapping process. With map merging, the robots in contrast individually build local maps without any knowledge about their relative positions. The goal is then to identify regions of overlap at which the local maps can be joined together. A concrete approach to this idea is presented in form of a special similarity metric and a stochastic search algorithm. Given two maps m and m', the search algorithm transforms m' by rotations and translations to find a maximum overlap between m and m'. In doing so, the heuristic similarity metric guides the search algorithm toward optimal solutions.

Stable rotation reversal is accomplished by making the estimator insensitive to the stator resistance.

The difficulty of these tasks increases considerably with occlusions and therefore with crowding. When the objects are constrained to be of the same kind, however, partitioning of densely crowded semi-rigid objects can be accomplished by means of clustering tracked feature points. We base our approach on a highly parallelized version of the KLT tracker in order to process the video into a set of feature trajectories. While such a set of trajectories provides a substrate for motion analysis, their unequal lengths and fragmented nature present difficulties for subsequent processing. To address this, we propose a simple means of spatially and temporally conditioning the trajectories. Given this representation, we integrate it with a learned object descriptor to achieve a segmentation of the constituent motions.

"EMC DESIGN FUNDAMENTALS","J. Colotti","colotti@telephonics.com","2006 IEEE Long Island Systems, Applications and Technology Conference","","2006","","","1","2","Summary form only given. Virtually every electronic device or system designed today is required to comply with EMC standards. Proper EMC design, throughout the development cycle, is necessary to cost-effectively ensure that products operate reliably in their intended electromagnetic environment without being susceptible to electrical noise from other devices, or generate excessive noise that can interfere with other devices. Meeting this goal has become especially challenging in recent years, due to the ever-growing use of electronics, increasing clock frequencies and escalading wireless-bandwidth demands. Products that do not comply with the applicable EMC requirements, can be blocked from markets, and/or can create interoperability issues with consequences ranging from a minor annoyance to death. EMC standards have been established by several agencies including the Federal Communication Commission (FCC), the US Military, the European Union (EU) and the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA). Although numerous standards exist, they have a common fundamental theme; to establish a maximum limit on emissions and to establish a minimum level on susceptibility (immunity). To understand the impact of EMC on design, it is first necessary to understand the fundamental concepts of electromagnetic interference and electromagnetic compatibility. For an EMC problem to exist, three components are necessary: a source that generates the interference, a device that is susceptible to the interference, and a coupling path. The coupling path can be conducted (through power and/or signal lines) or radiated (magnetic, electric or plane wave). Fortunately several options exist for mitigating EMC issues. The effectiveness of the coupling path can be reduced (i.e. the isolation between the source and the susceptible device can be improved) through the use of increased separation, shielding, filtering, interconnection modifications, or a combination of these. Furthermore, the source can be modified to reduce the interference generated. Many of the techniques used to reduce the interference generated by the source can also be used to improve the immunity of the potentially susceptible device. These techniques include the routing of signals closer to ground planes and the operating frequency selection. System partitioning is also critical. Fundamentally, devices that are inherently noisy (such as power converters) should be located as far as practical from devices that require a low noise floor (such as wide dynamic range analog/digital converters). In larger/more-complex systems, signal and power distribution become an important component of the EMC design. An often-overlooked area is EMC design process. To cost-effectively ensure that products operate reliably in their specified electromagnetic environment, proper EMC practice must be considered throughout the development and manufacturing cycles. Since EMC can potentially affect all aspects of a product design (mechanical, electrical and system) it is often necessary to develop and maintain an EMC control plan that details the technical and administrative processes necessary to flow down the EMC requirements to all applicable portions of the product.","","978-1-4244-0299-1","10.1109/LISAT.2006.4302648","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4302648","","Electromagnetic compatibility;Electromagnetic compatibility and interference;Working environment noise;Consumer electronics;Electromagnetic interference;Noise generators;Frequency;Military standards;FCC;Electromagnetic radiative interference","electromagnetic compatibility;electromagnetic coupling;electromagnetic interference;electromagnetic shielding;immunity testing","EMC DESIGN;electromagnetic interference;electromagnetic compatibility;coupling path;immunity;system partitioning;signal distribution;power distribution;EMC control plan;shielding;filtering;interconnection modifications","","2","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we survey the issues and concerns surrounding the deployment and maintenance of wireless sensor networks. Research focuses on several distinct areas affecting survivability: 1) power, 2) network/node destruction and repair, and 3) network security. Areas of concern are identified and currently proposed solutions are reviewed. Areas of research targeted at addressing survivability are identified. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have a wide variety of potential applications in agricultural, environmental monitoring, homeland security, safety, medical, and military applications, to name a few. The reliance on these WSNs often causes their presence to be mission critical. For this reason, it is vital that these sensor networks remain viable. This paper focuses on the different types of risks inherit in the environment that may cause either a sensor node or entire WSN to fail and the current approaches suggested for addressing these risks. In addition, this paper examines the survivability of nodes and data from a network viewpoint where the nodes are not physically affected but may be attacked by various means of denial-of-service, compromise, or some related detrimental effect. The definition that has been proposed for network survivability is, ""the ability of a network to accomplish its purpose, in a timely manner, in light of threats, attacks, or failures"". As one can see from the definition, the emphasis focuses on the continued functioning of the network regardless of the type of threat. For traditional computer networks, security and physical redundancy are employed in an effort to assure survivability. Weaknesses have been identified, particularly in the last-mile of a network where damage to the physical network prevents its continued availability. Options, like the use of wireless line-of-site connectivity, are often employed to provide redundancy and thereby, aid in making the network survivable. Wireless sensor networks, because of their potential for physical isolation, may be more vulnerable to attack. In addition, due to their characteristic low processor capability, WSNs do not have the capacity to utilize sophisticated anti-intrusion prevention technologies. Creating ways to detect and prevent threats do not, in themselves, help to determine whether a network will be able to operate during an attack. Mobile wireless networks present problems to survivability because of user mobility and free access. Mobile networks are also at risk during software upgrades. Network management tools that operate and maintain modern systems can be plagued with problems, creating an additional point for failure. Two distinct categories of survivability are: 1) information access and 2) end-to-end communication. These requirements apply to all of the networking layers. Building upon these two requirement categories, we examine the cause of WSN failure, both hardware and software based, and then identify means by which survivability may be supported","1558-058X","1-4244-0168-2","10.1109/second.2006.1629377","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1629377","","Wireless sensor networks;National security;Biomedical monitoring;Terrorism;Domestic safety;Mission critical systems;Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer security;Communication system security","mobility management (mobile radio);telecommunication network reliability;wireless sensor networks","survivability;wireless sensor networks;network security;denial-of-service;network survivability;wireless line-of-site connectivity;anti-intrusion prevention;mobile networks;network management;end-to-end communication;information access","","4","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, MM20 extends its application range from low-voltage LDMOS devices up to high-voltage LDMOS devices of about 100V. In this paper, the new dc model of MM20, including quasi-saturation, is presented. The addition of velocity saturation in the drift region ensures the current to be controlled by either the channel region or the drift region. A comparison with dc measurements on a 60-V LDMOS device shows that the new model provides an accurate description in all regimes of operation, ranging from subthreshold to superthreshold, in both the linear and saturation regime.

Sci., Simon Fraser Univ., Vancouver, BC, Canada","2006 American Control Conference","","2006","","","6 pp.","","With an emphasis on fault isolation and by treating fault detection as a byproduct of fault isolation, both actuator and sensor fault detection and isolation (FDI) problems for a class of uncertain Lipschitz nonlinear systems are studied using an unknown input observer (UIO) design technique. To solve the actuator fault detection and isolation problem, we develop a particular system structure by regrouping the system inputs, which is suitable for UIO design. By filtering the regrouped outputs properly, the same system structure can be developed for sensor fault detection and isolation problem, which allows us to treat the sensor fault detection and isolation problem as an actuator fault detection and isolation problem. To accomplish FDI efficiently, a novel full order nonlinear UIO is designed with a special property suitable for fault isolation purposes and a necessary and sufficient condition for its existence are presented. The LMI based sufficient condition enables the designers to use Matlab LMI toolbox and makes the computationally difficult UIO design much easier. For UIO based FDI, the following three problems are investigated: 1) under what conditions is it possible to isolate single and/or multiple faults? 2) What is the maximum number of faults that can be isolated simultaneously? 3) How to design fault isolation schemes to achieve multiple fault isolation (that is, to make decisions on how many faults have occurred and the location of each fault)? Conditions for problem 1) are derived and the maximum number of faults that can be isolated is determined for problem 2) to solve problem 3) an FDI scheme is designed using a bank of nonlinear UIOs and its design procedure is presented in a step by step fashion. An example is given to show how to use the proposed FDI scheme and simulations results illustrate that the proposed technique works well for FDI in uncertain Lipschitz nonlinear systems","2378-5861","1-4244-0210-7","10.1109/ACC.2006.1657536","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1657536","","Fault detection;Nonlinear systems;Robustness;Sensor systems;Sufficient conditions;Uncertainty;Design methodology;Hydraulic actuators;Filtering;Monitoring","fault diagnosis;large-scale systems;matrix algebra;observers;uncertain systems","sensor fault detection;sensor fault isolation;uncertain Lipschitz nonlinear systems;unknown input observer design;actuator fault detection;actuator fault isolation","","24","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The method is based on the axis layout of parallel coordinates, with boxes representing the categories and parallelograms between the axes showing the relations between categories. In addition to the visual representation, we designed a rich set of interactions. Parallel Sets allow the user to interactively remap the data to new categorizations and, thus, to consider more data dimensions during exploration and analysis than usually possible. At the same time, a metalevel, semantic representation of the data is built. Common procedures, like building the cross product of two or more dimensions, can be performed automatically, thus complementing the interactive visualization.

Center, East Hartford, CT; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","","2006","42","3","778","795","Multiple target tracking requires data association that operates in conjunction with filtering. When multiple targets are closely spaced, the conventional approaches (as, e.g., MHT/assignment) may not give satisfactory results. This is mainly because of the difficulty in deciding what the number of targets is. Recently, the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter has been proposed and particle filtering techniques have been developed to implement the PHD filter. In the particle PHD filter, the track labeling problem is not considered, i.e., the PHD is obtained only for a frame at a time, and it is very difficult to perform the multipeak extraction, particularly in high clutter environments. A track labeling method combined with the PHD approach, as well as considering the finite resolution, is proposed here for multitarget tracking, i.e., we keep a separate tracker for each target, use the PHD in the resolution cell to get the estimated number and locations of the targets at each time step, and then perform the track labeling (""peak-to-track"" association), whose results can provide information for PHD peak extraction at the next time step. Besides, by keeping a separate tracker for each target, our approach provides more information than the standard particle PHD filter. For example, in group target tracking, if we are interested in the motion of a specific target, we can track this target, which is not possible for the standard particle PHD filter, since the standard particle PHD filter does not keep track labels. Using our approach, multitarget tracking can be performed with automatic track initiation, maintenance, spawning, merging, and termination","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2006.248213","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4014447","","Labeling;Filters;Target tracking;Particle tracking;Filtering;Merging;Data engineering;Constraint optimization;State estimation;Data mining","particle filtering (numerical methods);sensor fusion;target tracking","track labeling;PHD filter;probability hypothesis density filter;multiple target tracking;data association;particle filtering;multipeak extraction;finite resolution;peak extraction;separate tracker;automatic track initiation","","80","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since the cables can only work in tension, the set of poses of the mobile platform for which the cables can balance any external wrench, i.e., for which the platform of the mechanism is fully constrained, is often limited or even nonexistent. Thus, the study and determination of this set of poses, called the wrench-closure workspace (WCW), is an important issue for parallel cable-driven mechanisms. In this paper, the case of planar parallel cable-driven mechanisms is addressed. Theorems that characterize the poses of the WCW are proposed. Then, these theorems are used to disclose the parts of the reachable workspace which belong to the WCW. Finally, an efficient algorithm that determines the constant-orientation cross-sections of these parts is introduced.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2006.870638","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1638336","Cable-driven mechanisms;parallel mechanisms;workspace;wrench-closure","Cables;Wires;Wounds;Councils;Cyclic redundancy check;Mechanical engineering;Testing;Parallel robots;Shape","robot dynamics;position control","wrench-closure workspace analysis;planar parallel cable-driven mechanisms;lightweight links","","155","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, the FAPs describing the movement of the outer-lip contours and eyebrows are used as observations. Experiments are first performed employing single-stream HMMs under several different scenarios, utilizing outer-lip and eyebrow FAPs individually and jointly. A multistream HMM approach is proposed for introducing facial expression and FAP group dependent stream reliability weights. The stream weights are determined based on the facial expression recognition results obtained when FAP streams are utilized individually.

A common office partition wall (that was in the main propagation path) was transformed into a frequency-selective (FS) wall by attaching a custom-designed band-stop frequency-selective surface (FSS) as a cover on the wall surface. In-situ measurements showed that this frequency-selective wall filtered out signals operating at 5.4-6.0 GHz (IEEE 802.11a) by an additional attenuation of 10-15 dB compared to the unmodified wall, for incident angles ranging from 0deg-55deg in the azimuth plane and 0deg-20deg in the elevation plane. An attenuation of 10-15 dB in signal strength in the stop band is considered to be significant and beneficial in interference reduction, whereas in the pass-band region (such as 1.8 GHz for cellular telephones), signals experienced only marginally more attenuation than that through the unmodified wall. Results also suggest that the interactions between the FSS and the wall surface can be minimized with an appropriate FSS design, which leads to a feasible and practical product solution: frequency-selective wallpapers.

The RBFNN uses a single neuron architecture whose input is proportional to the difference in error and the updating of its parameters is carried via a proportional value of the error. Also, the coefficients of the difference of error, error, and auxiliary signal used for improving damping performance are depicted by a genetic algorithm. The performance of the newly designed controller is evaluated in a four-machine power system subjected to different types of disturbances. The newly designed single-neuron RBFNN-based UPFC exhibits better damping performance compared to the conventional PID as well as the extended Kalman filter (EKF) updating-based RBFNN scheme, making the unstable cases stable.

Email: gtesauro@us.ibm.com; NA; NA; NA","2006 IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing","","2006","","","65","73","Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a promising new approach to systems performance management that differs radically from standard queuing-theoretic approaches making use of explicit system performance models. In principle, RL can automatically learn high-quality management policies without an explicit performance model or traffic model and with little or no built-in system specific knowledge. In our original work [1], [2], [3] we showed the feasibility of using online RL to learn resource valuation estimates (in lookup table form) which can be used to make high-quality server allocation decisions in a multi-application prototype Data Center scenario. The present work shows how to combine the strengths of both RL and queuing models in a hybrid approach in which RL trains offline on data collected while a queuing model policy controls the system. By training offline we avoid suffering potentially poor performance in live online training. We also now use RL to train nonlinear function approximators (e.g. multi-layer perceptrons) instead of lookup tables; this enables scaling to substantially larger state spaces. Our results now show that in both open-loop and closed-loop traffic, hybrid RL training can achieve significant performance improvements over a variety of initial model-based policies. We also find that, as expected, RL can deal effectively with both transients and switching delays, which lie outside the scope of traditional steady-state queuing theory.","","1-4244-0175-5","10.1109/ICAC.2006.1662383","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1662383","","Learning;Resource management;System performance;Traffic control;Table lookup;Knowledge management;Cost accounting;Prototypes;Control system synthesis;Open loop systems","","","","135","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to practical limitations in the analog-to-digital conversion process, some analog signal processing stages are likely to remain also in the continuation. With the ever-increasing demands for the system performance and supported data rates on one side, and the terminal flexibility and implementation costs on the other, the requirements for these remaining analog front-end stages become extremely challenging to meet. Then, one interesting idea in this context is to apply sophisticated DSP-based techniques to compensate for some of the most fundamental nonidealities of the receiver analog front-ends. In this paper, we focus on developing and demonstrating novel digital techniques to mitigate the effects of harmonic and intermodulation distortion in wideband multicarrier or multichannel receivers using adaptive interference cancellation. The approach in general is practically oriented and largely based on analyzing and processing measured real-world receiver front-end signals. The obtained results indicate that the proposed compensation technique can be used to suppress nonlinear distortion due to receiver front-end sections under realistic signaling assumptions","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2006.875274","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1643562","Adaptive filters;communication system nonlinearities;digital radios;harmonic and intermodulation distortion;radio receivers","Digital signal processing;Nonlinear distortion;Wideband;Receivers;Signal processing;Analog-digital conversion;System performance;Costs;Intermodulation distortion;Interference cancellation","analogue-digital conversion;harmonic distortion;interference suppression;intermodulation distortion;radio receivers;signal processing","digital signal processing techniques;nonlinear distortion;wideband multicarrier radio receivers;wireless device;analog-to-digital conversion process;analog signal processing;receiver analog front-ends;intermodulation distortion;multichannel receivers;adaptive interference cancellation;harmonic distortion","","69","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Stability of the results across different runs is considered to be an asset of the algorithm. The cluster ensembles considered here are based on k-means clusterers. Each clusterer is assigned a random target number of clusters, k and is started from a random initialization. Here, we use 10 artificial and 10 real data sets to study ensemble stability with respect to random k, and random initialization. The data sets were chosen to have a small number of clusters (two to seven) and a moderate number of data points (up to a few hundred). Pairwise stability is defined as the adjusted Rand index between pairs of clusterers in the ensemble, averaged across all pairs. Nonpairwise stability is defined as the entropy of the consensus matrix of the ensemble. An experimental comparison with the stability of the standard k-means algorithm was carried out for k from 2 to 20. The results revealed that ensembles are generally more stable, markedly so for larger k. To establish whether stability can serve as a cluster validity index, we first looked at the relationship between stability and accuracy with respect to the number of clusters, k. We found that such a relationship strongly depends on the data set, varying from almost perfect positive correlation (0.97, for the glass data) to almost perfect negative correlation (-0.93, for the crabs data). We propose a new combined stability index to be the sum of the pairwise individual and ensemble stabilities. This index was found to correlate better with the ensemble accuracy. Following the hypothesis that a point of stability of a clustering algorithm corresponds to a structure found in the data, we used the stability measures to pick the number of clusters.

Specifically, accurate detection of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) is imperative to prepare for the possible onset of life-threatening arrhythmias. Although many groups have developed highly accurate algorithms for detecting PVC beats, results have generally been limited to relatively small data sets. Additionally, many of the highest classification accuracies (>90%) have been achieved in experiments where training and testing sets overlapped significantly. Expanding the overall data set greatly reduces overall accuracy due to significant variation in ECG morphology among different patients. As a result, we believe that morphological information must be coupled with timing information, which is more constant among patients, in order to achieve high classification accuracy for larger data sets. With this approach, we combined wavelet-transformed ECG waves with timing information as our feature set for classification. We used select waveforms of 18 files of the MIT/BIH arrhythmia database, which provides an annotated collection of normal and arrhythmic beats, for training our neural-network classifier. We then tested the classifier on these 18 training files as well as 22 other files from the database. The accuracy was 95.16% over 93,281 beats from all 40 files, and 96.82% over the 22 files outside the training set in differentiating normal, PVC, and other beats","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2006.880879","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4015610","Electrocardiogram (ECG);heartbeat classifier;neural networks;premature ventricular contraction;wavelets","Robustness;Heart rate variability;Wavelet transforms;Timing;Electrocardiography;Testing;Morphology;Neural networks;Cardiac disease;Myocardium","electrocardiography;medical signal processing;neural nets;signal classification;wavelet transforms","robust neural-network-based classification;premature ventricular contractions;wavelet transform;timing interval features;automatic electrocardiogram beat classification;ECG;life-threatening arrhythmias;timing information","Algorithms;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electrocardiography;Heart Rate;Humans;Neural Networks (Computer);Reproducibility of Results;Retrospective Studies;Sensitivity and Specificity;Time Factors;Ventricular Premature Complexes;Ventricular Premature Complexes","188","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Reconstructions are based on a single frame structured light illumination. Instead of using generic, static coding that is supposed to work under all circumstances, system adaptation is proposed. This occurs on-the-fly and renders the system more robust against instant scene variability and creates suitable patterns at startup. A continuous trade-off between speed and quality is made. A weighted combination of different coding cues - based upon pattern color, geometry, and tracking - yields a robust way to solve the correspondence problem. The individual coding cues are automatically adapted within a considered family of patterns. The weights to combine them are based on the average consistency with the result within a small time-window. The integration itself is done by reformulating the problem as a graph cut. Also, the camera-projector configuration is taken into account for generating the projection patterns. The correctness of the range maps is not guaranteed, but an estimation of the uncertainty is provided for each part of the reconstruction. Our prototype is implemented using unmodified consumer hardware only and, therefore, is cheap.

Recently, due to its simplicity and robustness, it also becomes increasingly used for the real-time dispatch and techno-economic analysis of power systems. It is a simplification of a full power flow looking only at active power. Aspects such as voltage support and reactive power management are possible to analyse. However, such simplifications cannot always be justified and sometimes lead to unrealistic results. Especially the implementation of power flow controlling devices is not trivial since standard DC power flow fundamentally neglects their effects. Until recently, this was not an issue as the application of power flow controlling devices in the European grid was limited. However, with the liberalisation of European electricity market and the introduction of large wind energy systems, the need for real power flow control has emerged and therefore, the use of these devices has been reconsidered. Several phase shifting transformers (PST) are being installed or planned in order to control flows. Therefore, it is important to fundamentally re-validate the fast, but less accurate, DC power flow method. In this paper the assumptions of DC power flow are analysed, and its validity is assessed by comparing the results of power flow simulations using both the DC and AC approaches on a modified IEEE 300 bus system with PSTs.","0537-9989","0-86341-613-6","10.1049/cp:20060013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1633613","","","power system control;load flow control;power markets;power system economics;power system simulation;reactive power;power grids;power transformers","DC power flow controlling device;contingency analysis;active power;European grid;electricity market;wind energy system;phase shifting transformer;installation;IEEE 300 bus system;real-time dispatch;techno-economic analysis;reactive power management","","46","","","","","","","IET","IET Conferences"

While several methods for small pulmonary nodules have previously been presented, the segmentation of larger tumors that appear frequently in oncological patients and are more likely to be complexly interconnected with lung morphology has not yet received much attention. We present a fast, automated segmentation method that is based on morphological processing and is suitable for both small and large lesions. In addition, the proposed approach addresses clinical challenges to volume assessment such as variations in imaging protocol or inspiration state by introducing a method of segmentation-based partial volume analysis (SPVA) that follows on the segmentation procedure. Accuracy and reproducibility studies were performed to evaluate the new algorithms. In vivo interobserver and interscan studies on low-dose data from eight clinical metastasis patients revealed that clinically significant volume change can be detected reliably and with negligible computation time by the presented methods. In addition, phantom studies were conducted. Based on the segmentation performed with the proposed method, the performance of the SPVA volumetry method was compared with the conventional technique on a phantom that was scanned with different dosages and reconstructed with varying parameters. Both systematic and absolute errors were shown to be reduced substantially by the SPVA method. The method was especially successful in accounting for slice thickness and reconstruction kernel variations, where the median error was more than halved in comparison to the conventional approach.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2006.871547","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1610747","Chest imaging;computer aided analysis;image segmentation;volume measurement;X-ray tomography","Solids;Lesions;Computed tomography;Image segmentation;Lungs;Imaging phantoms;Image reconstruction;Cancer;Medical treatment;Patient monitoring","lung;tumours;cancer;computerised tomography;medical image processing;image segmentation;phantoms;image reconstruction;measurement errors","morphological segmentation;partial volume analysis;volumetry;solid pulmonary lesions;thoracic CT scans;volumetric growth assessment;lung cancer screening;oncological therapy monitoring;tumor segmentation;in vivo interobserver studies;in vivo interscan studies;clinical metastasis patients;phantom;image reconstruction;systematic errors;absolute errors;median error","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Coin Lesion, Pulmonary;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Phantoms, Imaging;Radiographic Image Enhancement;Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Radiography, Thoracic;Radiography, Thoracic;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Tomography, X-Ray Computed","170","","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared to the aggregated sphere-shaped particles (SS), the de-aggregated flake-shaped carbonyl iron particles (FS) have higher permeability, lower permittivity, better filling characteristics in epoxy resin, and better absorbing properties in the frequency range of 2-18 GHz. For the FS composite with volume fraction of 0.60 at single-layer thickness of 1 mm, the calculated reflection loss at 2 GHz reaches -4.04 dB and the minimum reflection loss is -12.2 dB at 4.4 GHz, which indicates that the FS composite can be applied as a thinner microwave absorber in the S-band than if SS particles are used.

Comparison and analysis of the data collected show that far-infrared thermography has difficulties in capturing vein images in the palm, and wrist. However, while it is more suitable for capturing the large veins in the back of the hand, it is sensitive to ambient conditions and human body condition and does not provide a stable image quality. On the other hand, near-infrared imaging produces good quality images when capturing vein patterns in the back of the hand, palm, and wrist. It is more tolerant to changes in environmental and body condition, but it also faces the problem of disruption due to skin features such as hairs and line patterns.

In the conventional force control, much research has paid attention to develop novel force control systems and implemented force sensors to detect external force. This paper shows that narrow bandwidth of force sensor has a big influence on the force control system. Generally, to solve the instability in force control, the velocity feedback gain is enlarged. The system becomes unstable with small velocity feedback gain, and robot's response becomes slow with large one. Inasmuch as there is a tradeoff between the stability and the response, it is considered that force control by robots is difficult. This paper proposes a force control system with disturbance observer. It is possible to obtain the force information with wide bandwidth by using the disturbance observer. This paper shows that bandwidth of force sensing is very important for contact motion control. By using the wide bandwidth of force sensing, both stability and response are improved. Furthermore, force control is attainable by the construction of the easiest force control architecture. Therefore, the ideal zero-stiffness-force control is attained.

Rule learning, neural networks, statistics, and hidden Markov models (HMMs) are some of the kinds of representative methods for intrusion detection. Among them, neural networks are known for good performance in learning system-call sequences. In order to apply this knowledge to real-world problems successfully, it is important to determine the structures and weights of these call sequences. However, finding the appropriate structures requires very long time periods because there are no suitable analytical solutions. In this paper, a novel intrusion-detection technique based on evolutionary neural networks (ENNs) is proposed. One advantage of using ENNs is that it takes less time to obtain superior neural networks than when using conventional approaches. This is because they discover the structures and weights of the neural networks simultaneously. Experimental results with the 1999 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Intrusion Detection Evaluation (IDEVAL) data confirm that ENNs are promising tools for intrusion detection.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2005.860136","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1634649","Anomaly detection;computer security;evolutionary algorithms;intrusion detection system (IDS);neural networks","Neural networks;Intrusion detection;Hidden Markov models;Computer security;Machine learning;Statistics;Evolutionary computation;Data security;Information security;Pattern matching","evolutionary computation;neural nets;security of data;learning (artificial intelligence)","evolutionary neural network;anomaly detection;program behavior;machine learning techniques;system-call audit data;intrusion detection;system-call sequences;Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Security;Evolution;Neural Networks (Computer);Pattern Recognition, Automated;Software;Software Validation","78","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With fully exploited knowledge of speckle image models, the edges of images are detected using normalized wavelet modulus. Relying on this feature, both the envelope-detected speckle image and the log-compressed ultrasonic image can be directly processed by the algorithm without need for additional preprocessing. Speckle is suppressed by employing the iterative multiscale diffusion on the wavelet coefficients. With a tuning diffusion threshold strategy, the proposed method can improve the image quality for both visualization and auto-segmentation applications.

The impedance bandwidth with VSWR<2 is from 3.1 GHz to more than 12 GHz. The actual operating bandwidth is, however, limited by the distortion of radiation patterns. Such pattern distortion can be attributed to the antenna mode transition and is investigated in this paper with the help of the radiation patterns in the traditional sense as well as a dimensionless normalized antenna transfer function. By suitably allocating such mode-transition phenomenon to the notched band in a UWB radio, we demonstrate that antennas with desirable radiation characteristics in both UWB low and high bands can be readily achieved.

Regarding FM-CW SAR signal processing, the motion during the transmission of a sweep and the reception of the corresponding echo were expected to be one of the major problems. In FM-CW SAR, the so-called stop-and-go approximation is no longer valid due to the relatively long sweeps that FM-CW radars transmit. The main effect of the continuous motion is a Doppler frequency shift throughout the SAR observation time.

The recording system consists of a digital sound recorder and a microphone attached to the patient's chest. The recognition algorithm follows a keyword-spotting approach, with cough sounds representing the keywords. It was trained on 821 min selected from 10 ambulatory recordings, including 2473 manually labeled cough events, and tested on a database of nine recordings from separate patients with a total recording time of 3060 min and comprising 2155 cough events. The average detection rate was 82% at a false alarm rate of seven events/h, when considering only events above an energy threshold relative to each recording's average energy. These results suggest that HMMs can be applied to the detection of cough sounds from ambulatory patients. A postprocessing stage to perform a more detailed analysis on the detected events is under development, and could allow the rejection of some of the incorrectly detected events.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2006.873548","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1634502","Automatic detection;cough counts;cough monitor;hidden Markov models","Signal detection;Audio recording;Hidden Markov models;Event detection;Diseases;Frequency;Clinical diagnosis;Digital recording;Microphones;Testing","bioacoustics;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;hidden Markov models;diseases","cough signal detection;continuous audio recordings;hidden Markov models;respiratory diseases;chronic cough;cough sounds;continuous ambulatory recordings;digital sound recorder;microphone;recognition algorithm;key word-spotting approach;821 min","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Auscultation;Cough;Cough;Cough;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Humans;Markov Chains;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Sound Spectrography","84","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Eng., IIT-Bombay, Mumbai, India; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","","2006","21","2","973","981","Many developing countries have emphasis on distributed generation (DG) technology for their generation expansion planning. The planning considerations and judicious choice of attributes are dictated by prevailing conditions. The attributes considered are capital costs, energy not served per annum, and profits from injecting power into the grid at peak load, all of which are important for a developing country. The uncertain futures considered are three possible loading conditions, which can be low, medium and high. Different scenarios (plans) are generated by various combinations of configurations. DGs can be configured as stand-alone mode, hybrid operation, or micro-grid formation with or without grid connection. With the increased complexities in DG planning options along with the multiple attributes to be accounted, more sophisticated techniques other than conventional economic analysis are needed to arrive at correct decisions by decision makers. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is used for obtaining relative weights in an objective way. Further, the statistical method like interval-based multi-attribute decision making with tradeoff analysis is used for shortlisting the feasible plans and identifying the most appropriate plan. It is proposed to use the weights obtained from AHP for finding the performance efficiencies in data envelopment analysis (DEA) for evaluating the plans.

As a consequence, many of the network protocols designed for radio channels are either not applicable, or have extremely low efficiency over underwater acoustic channels. These facts necessitate a dedicated design of protocols for an underwater acoustic network. A medium access control (MAC) protocol suitable for an underwater acoustic network is proposed and analyzed. The protocol is based on a channel access discipline called floor acquisition multiple access (FAMA) which combines both carrier sensing (CS) and a dialogue between the source and receiver prior to data transmission. During the initial dialogue, control packets are exchanged between the source node and the intended destination node to avoid multiple transmissions at the same time. Special attention is paid to the networks that are not fully connected, in which nodes can be hidden from each other. The new protocol uses time slotting and is thus called slotted FAMA. Time slotting eliminates the need for excessively long control packets, thus providing savings in energy. Protocol performance in throughput and delay is assessed through simulation of a mobile ad hoc underwater network, showing the existence of optimal power level to be used for a given user density.","","978-1-4244-0137-6","10.1109/OCEANSAP.2006.4393832","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4393832","","Media Access Protocol;Underwater acoustics;Access protocols;Multiaccess communication;Propagation delay;Educational institutions;Packet radio networks;Bit rate;Data communication;Throughput","ad hoc networks;carrier sense multiple access;underwater acoustic communication","slotted FAMA;MAC protocol;underwater acoustic networks;network protocol design;underwater acoustic channels;medium access control protocol;floor acquisition multiple access;carrier sensing;pre-data transmission source-receiver dialogue;control packet exchange;time slotting;mobile ad hoc underwater network","","218","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed method for the estimation of speed and stator resistance is based only on measurement of stator currents. The error of the measured q-axis current from its reference value feeds the proportional plus integral (PI) controller, the output of which is the estimated slip frequency. It is subtracted from the synchronous angular frequency, which is obtained from the output integral plus proportional (IP) rotor speed controller, to have the estimated rotor speed. For current regulation, this paper proposes a conventional PI controller with feedforward compensation terms in the synchronous frame. Owing to its advantages, an IP controller is used for rotor speed regulation. Stator resistance updating is based on the measured and reference d-axis stator current of an induction motor on d-q frame synchronously rotating with the stator flux vector. Experimental results for a 3-kW induction motor are presented and analyzed by using a dSpace system with DS1102 controller board based on the digital signal processor (DSP) TMS320C31.

Visual interpretation of gestures can be useful in accomplishing natural human-robot interaction (HRl). Previous HRI researches were focused on issues such as hand gesture, sign language, and command gesture recognition. However, automatic recognition of whole body gestures is required in order to operate HRI naturally. This can be a challenging problem because describing and modeling meaningful gesture patterns from whole body gestures are complex tasks. This paper presents a new method for spotting and recognizing whole body key gestures at the same time on a mobile robot. Our method is simultaneously used with other HRI approaches such as speech recognition, face recognition, and so forth. In this regard, both of execution speed and recognition performance should be considered. For efficient and natural operation, we used several approaches at each step of gesture recognition; learning and extraction of articulated joint information, representing gesture as a sequence of clusters, spotting and recognizing a gesture with HMM. In addition, we constructed a large gesture database, with which we verified our method. As a result, our method is successfully included and operated in a mobile robot","","0-7695-2503-2","10.1109/FGR.2006.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1613091","","Intelligent robots;Mobile robots;Humans;Handicapped aids;Biological system modeling;Speech recognition;Face recognition;Data mining;Hidden Markov models;Databases","face recognition;gesture recognition;image sequences;intelligent robots;man-machine systems;mobile robots;speech recognition;visual databases","automatic gesture recognition;intelligent human-robot interaction;hand gesture;sign language;command gesture recognition;whole body gestures;mobile robot;speech recognition;face recognition;articulated joint information;image sequence;gesture database","","9","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we develop a Bayesian age difference classifier that classifies face images of individuals based on age differences and performs face verification across age progression. Further, we study the similarity of faces across age progression.

Traditional systems utilize computer room air conditioning (CRAC) units to pressurize a raised floor plenum with cool air that is passed to equipment racks via ventilation tiles distributed throughout the raised floor. Temperature is typically controlled at the hot air return of the CRAC units away from the equipment racks. Due primarily to a lack of distributed environmental sensing, these CRAC systems are often operated conservatively resulting in reduced computational density and added operational expense. This paper introduces a data center environmental control system that utilizes a distributed sensor network to manipulate conventional CRAC units within an air-cooled environment. The sensor network is attached to standard racks and provides a direct measurement of the environment in close proximity to the computational resources. A calibration routine is used to characterize the response of each sensor in the network to individual CRAC actuators. A cascaded control algorithm is used to evaluate the data from the sensor network and manipulate supply air temperature and flow rate from individual CRACs to ensure thermal management while reducing operational expense. The combined controller and sensor network has been deployed in a production data center environment.

However, the performance of 2-D FR systems can be degraded by natural factors such as expressions, illuminations, pose, and aging. Several FR algorithms have been proposed to deal with the resulting appearance variability. However, most of these methods employ features derived in the image or the space domain whereas there are benefits to working in the spatial frequency domain (i.e., the 2-D Fourier transforms of the images). These benefits include shift-invariance, graceful degradation, and closed-form solutions. We discuss the use of spatial frequency domain methods (also known as correlation filters or correlation pattern recognition) for FR and illustrate the advantages. However, correlation filters can be computationally demanding due to the need for computing 2-D Fourier transforms and may not match well for large-scale FR problems such as in the Face Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC) phase-II experiments that require the computation of millions of similarity metrics.

This allows active cannulas to have a small diameter and a high degree of dexterity, which should enable them to navigate through complex anatomy to sites inaccessible by current surgical robotic devices. Active cannulas may also enhance patient safety because their inherent compliance mitigates potential trauma from inadvertent tool-tissue collision. A consequence of our design is that dexterity improves with miniaturization.

Recently, PCA has been extensively employed for face-recognition algorithms, such as eigenface and fisherface. The encouraging results have been reported and discussed in the literature. Many PCA-based face-recognition systems have also been developed in the last decade. However, existing PCA-based face-recognition systems are hard to scale up because of the computational cost and memory-requirement burden. To overcome this limitation, an incremental approach is usually adopted. Incremental PCA (IPCA) methods have been studied for many years in the machine-learning community. The major limitation of existing IPCA methods is that there is no guarantee on the approximation error. In view of this limitation, this paper proposes a new IPCA method based on the idea of a singular value decomposition (SVD) updating algorithm, namely an SVD updating-based IPCA (SVDU-IPCA) algorithm. In the proposed SVDU-IPCA algorithm, we have mathematically proved that the approximation error is bounded. A complexity analysis on the proposed method is also presented. Another characteristic of the proposed SVDU-IPCA algorithm is that it can be easily extended to a kernel version. The proposed method has been evaluated using available public databases, namely FERET, AR, and Yale B, and applied to existing face-recognition algorithms. Experimental results show that the difference of the average recognition accuracy between the proposed incremental method and the batch-mode method is less than 1%. This implies that the proposed SVDU-IPCA method gives a close approximation to the batch-mode PCA method","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2006.870645","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1658299","Error analysis;face recognition;incremental principal component analysis (PCA);singular value decomposition (SVD)","Principal component analysis;Face recognition;Approximation error;Pattern recognition;Image analysis;Computational efficiency;Singular value decomposition;Approximation algorithms;Kernel;Databases","approximation theory;error analysis;face recognition;principal component analysis;singular value decomposition","incremental principal component analysis;face recognition;eigenface;fisherface;singular value decomposition;approximation error","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biometry;Computer Simulation;Face;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Principal Component Analysis","127","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we introduce an optimal (maximum a posteriori) joint estimator for the channel impulse response (CIR), CFO, and PHN, utilizing prior statistical knowledge of PHN that can be obtained from measurements or data sheets. In addition, in cases where a training symbol consists of two identical halves in the time domain, we propose a variant to Moose's CFO estimation algorithm that optimally removes the effect of PHN with lower complexity than with a nonrepeating training symbol. To further reduce the complexity of the proposed algorithms, simplified implementations based on the conjugate gradient method are also introduced such that the estimators studied in this paper can be realized efficiently using the fast Fourier transform with only minor performance degradation.

Unfortunately, in most problems the form of each class pdf is a priori unknown, and the selection of the DA algorithm that best fits our data is done over trial-and-error. Ideally, one would like to have a single formulation which can be used for most distribution types. This can be achieved by approximating the underlying distribution of each class with a mixture of Gaussians. In this approach, the major problem to be addressed is that of determining the optimal number of Gaussians per class, i.e., the number of subclasses. In this paper, two criteria able to find the most convenient division of each class into a set of subclasses are derived. Extensive experimental results are shown using five databases.

This note analyzes the stability of MPC when the terminal constraint is removed. This is particularly interesting when the system is unconstrained on the state. In this case, the computational burden of the optimization problem does not have to be increased by introducing terminal state constraints due to stabilizing reasons. A region in which the terminal constraint can be removed from the optimization problem is characterized depending on some of the design parameters of MPC. This region is a domain of attraction of the MPC without terminal constraint. Based on this result, it is proved that weighting the terminal cost, this domain of attraction of the MPC controller without terminal constraint is enlarged reaching (practically) the same domain of attraction of the MPC with terminal constraint; moreover, a practical procedure to calculate the stabilizing weighting factor for a given initial state is shown. Finally, these results are extended to the case of suboptimal solutions and an asymptotically stabilizing suboptimal controller without terminal constraint is presented.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2006.875014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1632315","Asymptotic stability;predictive control;suboptimal control","Control systems;Cost function;Constraint optimization;Predictive control;Sampling methods;Predictive models;Stability analysis;Design optimization;Current control;Trajectory","asymptotic stability;predictive control;suboptimal control","asymptotic stability;model predictive control;terminal cost function;suboptimal control;terminal constraint","","81","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One common practice is to seed faults in subject software, either manually or by using a program that generates all possible mutants based on a set of mutation operators. The latter allows the systematic, repeatable seeding of large numbers of faults, thus facilitating the statistical analysis of fault detection effectiveness of test suites; however, we do not know whether empirical results obtained this way lead to valid, representative conclusions. Focusing on four common control and data flow criteria (block, decision, C-use, and P-use), this paper investigates this important issue based on a middle size industrial program with a comprehensive pool of test cases and known faults. Based on the data available thus far, the results are very consistent across the investigated criteria as they show that the use of mutation operators is yielding trustworthy results: generated mutants can be used to predict the detection effectiveness of real faults. Applying such a mutation analysis, we then investigate the relative cost and effectiveness of the above-mentioned criteria by revisiting fundamental questions regarding the relationships between fault detection, test suite size, and control/data flow coverage. Although such questions have been partially investigated in previous studies, we can use a large number of mutants, which helps decrease the impact of random variation in our analysis and allows us to use a different analysis approach. Our results are then; compared with published studies, plausible reasons for the differences are provided, and the research leads us to suggest a way to tune the mutation analysis process to possible differences in fault detection probabilities in a specific environment","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2006.83","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1703390","Testing and debugging;testing strategies;test coverage of code;experimental design.","Genetic mutations;Fault detection;Software testing;Size control;Failure analysis;Statistical analysis;System testing;Industrial control;Costs;Debugging","data flow analysis;design of experiments;probability;program control structures;program debugging;program testing;software fault tolerance","mutation analysis;software testing coverage criteria;empirical assessment;software fault detection probability;industrial program;program control criteria;program data flow criteria;mutation operators;program debugging;experimental design","","225","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

They are the second leading cause of unintentional-injury death for people of all ages and the leading cause of death for elders 79 years and older. Studies have shown that the medical outcome of a fall is largely dependent upon the response and rescue time. Hence, a highly accurate automatic fall detector is an important component of the living setting for older adult to expedite and improve the medical care provided to this population. Though there are several kinds of fall detectors currently available, they suffer from various drawbacks.

This paper describes the working principle and the design of a floor vibration-based fall detector that is completely passive and unobtrusive to the resident. The detector was designed to overcome some of the common drawbacks of the earlier fall detectors. The performance of the detector is evaluated by conducting controlled laboratory tests using anthropomorphic dummies.

Power is recovered from a 450-MHz incident signal with the help of a low-threshold, high-efficiency, voltage rectifier-multiplier circuit. This technique decreases the minimum incident RF power required, compared to state-of-the-art wirelessly powered telemetry systems. The rectifier-multiplier can collect energy from a base station placed up to 18 m away. To further increase the range from the base, the device collects energy in a low power standby/charging mode. A mode selector circuit monitors the amount stored energy and decides if the system is transmitting data or is in the standby/charging mode. A bootstrapped reference generates a complementary to absolute temperature (CTAT) voltage with an R-squared regression of 0.9995 to a linear fit. This reference is used as the temperature sensor of the system, controlling a low-power, integrated, voltage-controlled LC oscillator (VCO). The oscillation frequency of the VCO is modulated by ambient temperature changes. The modulated carrier is transmitted by a fully integrated power amplifier.

The only assumptions we make about the system are well-posedness of the algebraic loop and local stability. Problems to be considered include the estimation of the domain of attraction, the reachable set under a class of bounded energy disturbances and the nonlinear L2 gain. The regional analysis is established through an effective treatment of the algebraic loop and the saturation/deadzone function. This treatment yields two forms of differential inclusions, a polytopic differential inclusion (PDI) and a norm-bounded differential inclusion (NDI) that contain the original system. Adjustable parameters are incorporated into the differential inclusions to reflect the regional property. The main idea behind the regional analysis is to ensure that the state remain inside the level set of a certain Lyapunov function where the PDI or the NDI is valid. With quadratic Lyapunov functions, conditions for stability and performances are derived as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). To obtain less conservative conditions, we use a pair of conjugate non-quadratic Lyapunov functions, the convex hull quadratic function and the max quadratic function. These functions yield bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs) as conditions for stability and guaranteed performance level. The BMI conditions cover the corresponding LMI conditions as special cases, hence the BMI results are guaranteed to be as good as the LMI results.

Kartalopoulos","Oklahoma Univ., Norman, OK, USA","IEEE Communications Magazine","","2006","44","4","146","151","The secure transport of messages was the concern of many early civilizations. Since then, different methods have been developed to assure that only the sender and the addressee would be able to read a message, while it would be illegible or without significant meaning to a third party. Today, this practice continues with more fervor. Wireless, wired, and optical communication networks are able to transport unimaginable amounts of data and thus privacy of information and security of the network are of the utmost concern because a good part of the transported information may be very sensitive and/or confidential. Confidentiality of information has been particularly popularized with the explosive growth of the Internet, which has touched most people's lives. However, from the outset, the Internet was based on open network architecture with computer-based nodes and without network security, and thus was vulnerable to attackers and hackers. Wireless networks transmit in unguarded space and thus are also subject to malicious actors. Dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) optical networks transport a massive aggregate traffic that has exceeded terabits per second per single fiber; therefore, the issues of information privacy and network security are equally important. As a result, the development of unbreakable cipher keys, cipher-key distribution, identification of malicious actors, source authentication, physical-link signature identification, countermeasures, and so forth has been the major thrust of research efforts with regard to cyber-security. This article focuses on cryptography, and is the first of a series of three articles on cryptography and security in communications.

To map the visual signals onto the joints of the robot manipulator, this paper proposes a depth-independent interaction matrix, which differs from the traditional interaction matrix in that it does not depend on the depths of the feature points. Using the depth-independent interaction matrix makes the unknown camera parameters appear linearly in the closed-loop dynamics so that a new algorithm is developed to estimate their values on-line. This adaptive algorithm combines the Slotine-Li method with on-line minimization of the errors between the real and estimated projections of the feature points on the image plane. Based on the nonlinear robot dynamics, we prove asymptotic convergence of the image errors to zero by the Lyapunov theory.

In this paper, we developed an image-processing technique for suppressing the contrast of ribs and clavicles in chest radiographs by means of a multiresolution massive training artificial neural network (MTANN). An MTANN is a highly nonlinear filter that can be trained by use of input chest radiographs and the corresponding ""teaching"" images. We employed ""bone"" images obtained by use of a dual-energy subtraction technique as the teaching images. For effective suppression of ribs having various spatial frequencies, we developed a multiresolution MTANN consisting of multiresolution decomposition/composition techniques and three MTANNs for three different-resolution images. After training with input chest radiographs and the corresponding dual-energy bone images, the multiresolution MTANN was able to provide ""bone-image-like"" images which were similar to the teaching bone images. By subtracting the bone-image-like images from the corresponding chest radiographs, we were able to produce ""soft-tissue-image-like"" images where ribs and clavicles were substantially suppressed. We used a validation test database consisting of 118 chest radiographs with pulmonary nodules and an independent test database consisting of 136 digitized screen-film chest radiographs with 136 solitary pulmonary nodules collected from 14 medical institutions in this study. When our technique was applied to nontraining chest radiographs, ribs and clavicles in the chest radiographs were suppressed substantially, while the visibility of nodules and lung vessels was maintained. Thus, our image-processing technique for rib suppression by means of a multiresolution MTANN would be potentially useful for radiologists as well as for CAD schemes in detection of lung nodules on chest radiographs.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2006.871549","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1610746","Artificial neural network;chest radiography;computer-aided diagnosis (CAD);dual-energy subtraction;lung nodule;rib suppression","Ribs;Artificial neural networks;Spatial resolution;Image resolution;Diagnostic radiography;Lungs;Education;Bones;Medical tests;Image databases","diagnostic radiography;medical image processing;neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);image resolution","image processing;ribs;clavicles;chest radiographs;multiresolution massive training artificial neural network;lung nodules;computer-aided diagnosis;dual-energy subtraction technique;multiresolution decomposition/composition techniques;pulmonary nodules","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Coin Lesion, Pulmonary;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Neural Networks (Computer);Pattern Recognition, Automated;Radiographic Image Enhancement;Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Radiography, Thoracic;Reproducibility of Results;Retrospective Studies;Ribs;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","122","","70","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By solving this problem the amount of distributed-generation resources (DGRs) and reactive-power sources (RPSs) in selected buses of a distribution system, are determined taking account of their outputs at different load levels, tap positions of voltage regulators (VRs) and the status of sectionalising switches, in order to minimise the cost of power, energy losses and the total required reactive power subjected to a given total of distributed generation. Since the defined planning problem is a combinatorial one, a solution algorithm based on tabu search, that is an efficient heuristic method to a combinatorial-optimisation problem, is proposed. Various memory structures including short-, intermediate- and long-term memories have been implemented in the algorithm. The method has been tested on 33-bus and 69-bus radial distribution systems to demonstrate the performance of the algorithm and to investigate impact of some parameters such as maximum limits on size of DGRs (RPSs), constant or controllable outputs of these sources and different control variables sets on results of system planning. In addition, a novel technique for determining the candidate buses to install active (reactive) sources based on clustering system buses in view of assigning DGRs (RPSs) is presented.","1350-2360","","10.1049/ip-gtd:20050170","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1610508","","","distributed power generation;power distribution planning;reactive power;power distribution control;voltage regulators;losses;search problems;combinatorial mathematics;optimisation","distributed generation;reactive power;network-configuration planning;power loss reduction;energy-loss reduction;voltage regulator;power cost;tabu search;heuristic method;combinatorial-optimisation problem;memory structure;33-bus radial distribution system;69-bus radial distribution system;system bus","","30","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals"

Comparison between frequency and vector surge relays, which are islanding detection-dedicated devices, shows that the former can be as effective as the latter. This feature supports the idea that frequency relays can replace vector surge relays for islanding detection purpose. In this case, frequency relays must also meet the generator manufacturer recommendations and the utility frequency-tripping requirements. In order to investigate the relay capability to meet both necessities, it is proposed the concept of application region, which defines a region in the detection time versus active power imbalance space where frequency-based relays can be adjusted to satisfy the anti-islanding and frequency-tripping requirements simultaneously.

Initially, SoCs will be globally asynchronous and locally synchronous (GALS). But the complexity of the numerous asynchronous/synchronous interfaces required in a GALS will eventually lead to entirely asynchronous solutions. This paper introduces the main design principles, methods, and building blocks for asynchronous VLSI systems, with an emphasis on communication and synchronization. Asynchronous circuits with the only delay assumption of isochronic forks are called quasi-delay-insensitive (QDI). QDI is used in the paper as the basis for asynchronous logic. The paper discusses asynchronous handshake protocols for communication and the notion of validity/neutrality tests, and completion tree. Basic building blocks for sequencing, storage, function evaluation, and buses are described, and two alternative methods for the implementation of an arbitrary computation are explained. Issues of arbitration, and synchronization play an important role in complex distributed systems and especially in GALS. The two main asynchronous/synchronous interfaces needed in GALS-one based on synchronizer, the other on stoppable clock-are described and analyzed.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2006.875789","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1652900","Arbiter;asynchronous;asynchronous bus;asynchronous/synchronous interface;C-element;completion tree;dual-rail;globally asynchronous and locally synchronous (GALS);half-buffer;handshake protocol;isochronic fork;metastability;passive–active buffer;precharge half-buffer (PCHB);quasi-delay-insensitive (QDI);stoppable clock;synchronizer","System-on-a-chip;Synchronization;Clocks;Signal design;Design methodology;Very large scale integration;Asynchronous circuits;Delay;Logic;Protocols","asynchronous circuits;system-on-chip;VLSI;synchronisation;clocks","system-on-chip design;asynchronous interfaces;synchronous interfaces;GALS;VLSI system;asynchronous circuits;quasi-delay-insensitive;asynchronous logic;asynchronous handshake protocols;isochronic fork;stoppable clock","","194","","58","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In comparison with JND estimation for images, estimation of the JND profile for video needs to take into account the temporal HVS properties in addition to the spatial properties. In this paper, we develop a spatio-temporal model estimating JND in the discrete cosine transform domain. The proposed model incorporates the spatio-temporal contrast sensitivity function, the influence of eye movements, luminance adaptation, and contrast masking to be more consistent with human perception. It is capable of yielding JNDs for both still images and video with significant motion. The experiments conducted in this study have demonstrated that the JND values estimated for video sequences with moving objects by the model are in line with the HVS perception. The accurate JND estimation of the video towards the actual visibility bounds can be translated into resource savings (e.g., for bandwidth/storage or computation) and performance improvement in video coding and other visual processing tasks (such as perceptual quality evaluation, visual signal restoration/enhancement, watermarking, authentication, and error protection)","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2006.877397","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1661658","Contrast sensitivity function (CSF);discrete cosine transform (DCT);eye movement;just-noticeable distortion (JND)","Humans;Visual system;Discrete cosine transforms;Video sequences;Bandwidth;Water storage;Video coding;Signal restoration;Watermarking;Authentication","discrete cosine transforms;distortion;image sequences;video signal processing","just-noticeable video distortion estimation;maximum distortion;human visual system;perceptual image;video processing;spatio-temporal contrast sensitivity function;discrete cosine transform domain;eye movements;luminance adaptation;contrast masking;video sequences;video coding;perceptual quality evaluation;visual signal restoration;visual signal enhancement;watermarking;error protection","","105","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In communication, humans sense intelligence in their conversation partner. We aim to develop an intelligent robot that communicates in the same intelligent and human-like way in daily life. We use the total Turing test to evaluate the human-likeness of the android. In this test, subjects are shown either the android or another human for a short time. Subjects are then asked whether it was a human being or not. The android used in this study is called ReplieeQ2, which has an appearance and motions that closely resemble those of a human being. We hypothesize that an android that is given more human-like motions will be identified as a human in the total Turing test more often. To create human-like motion we observed humans behavior when sitting. We focused on eye, eyelid, neck and chest motions and analyzed them in detail. The android motions were made from this analysis and used in the Total Turing Test. We prepared three conditions: a static android (SA), an android given natural motions (MA), and a human sitting naturally (SH). We expose a subject to one of these conditions for either one or two seconds. We then examine how often they correctly identify the condition as either human or robot. SH was identified as human most often, followed by MA and then SA, for both exposure times. MA is judged to be significantly more humanlike than SA, within the two-second experiment time. This suggests that natural motions contribute to the human-likeness of the android. We also investigate the contributions of individual natural motions to human-likeness and likeability by a pair comparison method. The results show that eyelid motion is the most effective factor for expressing human-likeness and likeability. By enhancing the android's expressive power, this work contributes to the development of humanoids that communicate naturally with human beings.","2164-0580","1-4244-0199-2","10.1109/ICHR.2006.321379","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4115596","Android;Appearance and behavior;Total Turing Test;Communication;Unconscious motion","Intelligent robots;Artificial intelligence;Robot sensing systems;Testing;Psychology;Humanoid robots;Service robots;Human robot interaction;Eyelids;Neck","human computer interaction;humanoid robots;man-machine systems;Turing machines","motion composition;android humanlike motion;human-robot interaction;intelligent robot;total Turing test;android human-likeness;ReplieeQ2 robot;eye motion;eyelid motion;neck motion;chest motion;unconscious motion","","21","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, a MUSIC-like algorithm is presented, allowing estimation of wave's DOAs and polarization parameters. The algorithm is tested in numerical simulations, and performance analysis is conducted. When compared with other MUSIC-like algorithms for vector-sensor array, the newly proposed algorithm results in a reduction by half of memory requirements for representation of data covariance model and reduces the computational effort, for equivalent performance.

Sci., Illinois Univ., Chicago, IL","IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","","2006","18","12","1614","1628","This paper studies the problem of structured data extraction from arbitrary Web pages. The objective of the proposed research is to automatically segment data records in a page, extract data items/fields from these records, and store the extracted data in a database. Existing methods addressing the problem can be classified into three categories. Methods in the first category provide some languages to facilitate the construction of data extraction systems. Methods in the second category use machine learning techniques to learn wrappers (which are data extraction programs) from human labeled examples. Manual labeling is time-consuming and is hard to scale to a large number of sites on the Web. Methods in the third category are based on the idea of automatic pattern discovery. However, multiple pages that conform to a common schema are usually needed as the input. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective technique (called DEPTA) to perform the task of Web data extraction automatically. The method consists of two steps: 1) identifying individual records in a page and 2) aligning and extracting data items from the identified records. For step 1, a method based on visual information and tree matching is used to segment data records. For step 2, a novel partial alignment technique is proposed. This method aligns only those data items in a pair of records that can be aligned with certainty, making no commitment on the rest of the items. Experimental results obtained using a large number of Web pages from diverse domains show that the proposed two-step technique is highly effective","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2006.197","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1717419","Web data extraction;wrapper generation;partial tree alignement;Web mining.","Data mining;Web pages;HTML;Databases;Humans;Books;Machine learning;Labeling;Web mining;Information retrieval","database management systems;information retrieval;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);storage management;tree data structures","structured Web data extraction;partial tree alignment;Web pages;database;machine learning techniques;automatic pattern discovery;visual information;tree matching;data records;Web mining","","87","","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These uncertainties may be caused by uncertainty in direction-of-arrival (DOA), imperfect array calibration, near-far effect, mutual coupling, and other mismatch and modeling errors. A diagonal loading technique is obligatory to fulfil the uncertainty constraint where the diagonal loading level is amended to satisfy the constrained value. The major drawback of diagonal loading techniques is that it is not clear how to get the optimum value of diagonal loading level based on the recognized level of uncertainty constraint. In this paper, an alternative realization of the robust adaptive linearly constrained minimum variance beamforming with ellipsoidal uncertainty constraint on the steering vector is developed. The diagonal loading technique is integrated into the adaptive update schemes by means of optimum variable loading technique which provides loading-on-demand mechanism rather than fixed, continuous or ad hoc loading. We additionally enrich the proposed robust adaptive beamformers by imposing a cooperative quadratic constraint on the weight vector norm to overcome noise enhancement at low SNR. Several numerical simulations with DOA mismatch, moving jamming, and mutual coupling are carried out to explore the performance of the proposed schemes and compare their performance with other traditional and robust beamformers","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2006.886473","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4020392","Adaptive beamforming;Capon beamformer;conjugate gradient;constrained optimization;diagonal loading;linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamforming;moving jamming;mutual coupling;steepest descent","Array signal processing;Uncertainty;Mutual coupling;Noise robustness;Algorithm design and analysis;Adaptive arrays;Calibration;Signal to noise ratio;Numerical simulation;Jamming","adaptive antenna arrays;array signal processing;calibration;direction-of-arrival estimation;electromagnetic coupling","adaptive beamforming algorithm;direction-of-arrival;DOA;calibration;mutual coupling;diagonal loading technique;linearly constrained minimum variance;steering vector;adaptive update scheme;loading-on-demand mechanism;cooperative quadratic constraint","","80","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These electronic inverters operate in a current controlled mode to inject unity power factor sinusoidal current into the network. To prevent possible dc current injection, a mains frequency isolation transformer is often employed at the inverter output. This isolation transformer is a costly component. An alternative approach is to use current sensing and control techniques to eliminate the dc current component. One method is to use a current controller to force the output dc current to zero. Current controllers are prone to errors associated with nonlinearity and offsets in the current transducers.

Multihop networks use some form of cooperation by enabling intermediate nodes to forward the message from source to destination. However, cooperative communication techniques described in this article are fundamentally different in that the relaying nodes can forward the information fully or in part.

We develop a new PAPR reduction technique using the label-inserted encoder of a random-like code and the soft amplitude limiter (SAL). Using this hybrid scheme provides 5.5 dB PAPR reduction in an OFDM system with 128 subcarriers, 4-bit selection and 3 dB clipping. Besides the significant PAPR reduction, the scheme also enjoys other advantages such as small overhead, low complexity, no side information transmission, and little performance loss. Among various random-like codes, the irregular repeat accumulate (IRA) code is the best choice for its simple encoder and capacity achieving performance. The scheme can be directly applied to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) OFDM systems. The capacity of the clipped MIMO-OFDM systems is analyzed based on a Gaussian approximation of the clipping noise. We consider an iterative receiver with soft MAP MIMO-OFDM detector. For both single antenna and multiple antenna systems, the encoder part is independent in the hybrid scheme, thus no additional constraint is applied to the IRA code optimization. The IRA codes are designed for the ergodic MIMO-OFDM systems with different PAPR reduction settings, more specifically different clipping ratios, based on the extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts. Simulation results show that the hybrid scheme with 3 dB clipping can achieve as good PAPR reduction performance as the simple clipping with 0 dB ratio but incurs much less performance loss at the receiver","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2006.04136","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1705933","","Peak to average power ratio;OFDM;Performance loss;MIMO;Frequency division multiplexing;Propagation losses;Gaussian approximation;Gaussian noise;Detectors;Constraint optimization","Gaussian processes;limiters;maximum likelihood detection;MIMO systems;modulation coding;OFDM modulation;radio receivers;random codes","hybrid-PAPR reduction scheme;coded OFDM;peak-to-average power ratio;coded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems;label-inserted encoder;random-like code;soft amplitude limiter;irregular repeat accumulate code;multiple-input multiple-output systems;clipped MIMO-OFDM systems;Gaussian approximation;clipping noise;iterative receiver;soft MAP MIMO-OFDM detector;single antenna systems;multiple antenna systems;ergodic MIMO-OFDM systems;extrinsic information transfer charts;EXIT charts","","23","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To effectively cope with arbitrary malicious disruption of data transmissions, we propose and evaluate the secure message transmission (SMT) protocol and its alternative, the secure single-path (SSP) protocol. Among the salient features of SMT and SSP is their ability to operate solely in an end-to-end manner and without restrictive assumptions on the network trust and security associations. As a result, the protocols are applicable to a wide range of network architectures. We demonstrate that highly reliable communication can be sustained with small delay and small delay variability, even when a substantial portion of the network nodes systematically or intermittently disrupt communication. SMT and SSP robustly detect transmission failures and continuously configure their operation to avoid and tolerate data loss, and to ensure the availability of communication. This is achieved at the expense of moderate transmission and routing overhead, which can be traded off for delay. Overall, the ability of the protocols to mitigate both malicious and benign faults allows fast and reliable data transport even in highly adverse network environments.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2005.861392","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1589113","Fault tolerance;mobile ad hoc network (MANET) security;multipath routing;network security;secure data transmission;secure message transmission;secure routing","Data communication;Mobile ad hoc networks;Surface-mount technology;Protocols;Telecommunication network reliability;Disruption tolerant networking;Fault tolerance;Mobile communication;Spread spectrum communication;Wireless networks","data communication;mobile radio;ad hoc networks;fault tolerance;telecommunication network topology;message authentication;routing protocols;telecommunication security","data communication;mobile ad hoc network;MANET;fault-tolerant communication;multihop wireless network;network topology;secure message transmission;SMT protocol;transmission failure detection;multipath routing overhead","","71","","46","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Multipath clutter can occur when surface returns are multiply scattered, causing significant Doppler frequency and wavenumber spreads. In the worst case, multipath propagation may cause Doppler spread clutter to return via the receiver mainlobe. In such situations, conventional STAP cannot mitigate Doppler spread mainlobe clutter without also suppressing the target. MIMO radar techniques using orthogonal waveforms have been proposed for increasing radar coverage rate often at the expense of employing significantly larger radar time-bandwidth products. In this paper, we consider a MIMO approach wherein conventional radar waveforms are phase-coded to be orthogonal after Doppler processing at the receiver, i.e. in ""slow-time"". Slow-time MIMO has the advantages of being bandwidth efficient and easily implemented without the need to modify the receiver before range pulse-compression. In this paper, the mathematical formulation of MIMO STAP is developed for both direct-path and multipath clutter scenarios. At each slant range, the MIMO STAP processor operates on a receive sensor, transmitted pulses, and slow-time phase code channel data cube. Coherent combination of the decoded slow-time channels at the receiver permits effective control of the transmit array pattern by receive post-processing as a function of slant range. Simulation results demonstrate SNR gains when a transmit null is steered in the outbound direction towards the multiply scattered clutter.","2151-870X","1-4244-0308-1","10.1109/SAM.2006.1706131","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1706131","","MIMO;Radar clutter;Spaceborne radar;Doppler radar;Radar scattering;Adaptive arrays;Surface waves;Frequency;Bandwidth;Decoding","array signal processing;channel coding;decoding;Doppler radar;MIMO systems;pulse compression;radar clutter;radar signal processing;space-time adaptive processing","MIMO radar;space-time adaptive processing;multipath clutter mitigation;multiple-input-multiple-output;STAP;multipath propagation;receive arrays;transmit arrays;Doppler frequency;Doppler spread clutter;Doppler processing;slow-time MIMO;bandwidth efficient;pulse-compression;direct-path clutter scenarios;slow-time phase code channel;SNR","","37","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, making use of the alternating projection method, we replace the above search with a sequence of mono-dimensional searches. This results in an estimation algorithm of a reasonable complexity which is suitable for practical applications.

However, both edge and noise information is high-frequency information, so the loss of edge information is evident and inevitable in the denoising process. Edge information is the most important high-frequency information of an image, so we should try to maintain more edge information while denoising. From this comes the thesis of this paper. In it, we present a new image denoising method: wavelet image threshold denoising based on edge detection. Before denoising, those wavelet coefficients of an image that correspond to an image's edges are first detected by wavelet edge detection. The detected wavelet coefficients will then be protected from denoising, and we can therefore set the denoising thresholds based solely on the noise variances, without damaging the image's edges. The theoretical analyses and experimental results presented in this paper show that, compared to commonly-used wavelet threshold denoising methods, our method can keep an image's edges from damage and can increase the PSNR up to 1~2 dB. Finally, we can draw the conclusion that edge detection and denoising are two important branches of image processing. If we combine edge detection with denoising, we can overcome the shortcomings of commonly-used denoising methods and do denoising without notably blurring the edge.","","7-302-13922-9","10.1109/CESA.2006.4281626","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4281626","image processing;wavelet threshold denoising;wavelet edge detection","Noise reduction;Image edge detection;Wavelet coefficients;PSNR;Low pass filters;Image denoising;Protection;Image analysis;Wavelet analysis;Image processing","edge detection;image denoising;image segmentation;low-pass filters;wavelet transforms","wavelet image threshold denoising;noise information;edge information;low pass filters;wavelet coefficients;wavelet edge detection","","3","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We compare four years (2000 to 2003) of satellite-based calculations of GPP with tower eddy CO2 flux-based estimates across diverse land cover types and climate regimes. We examine the potential error contributions from meteorology, leaf area index (LAI)/fPAR, and land cover. The error between annual GPP computed from NASA's Data Assimilation Office's (DAO) and tower-based meteorology is 28%, indicating that NASA's DAO global meteorology plays an important role in the accuracy of the GPP algorithm. Approximately 62% of MOD15-based estimates of LAI were within the estimates based on field optical measurements, although remaining values overestimated site values. Land cover presented the fewest errors, with most errors within the forest classes, reducing potential error. Tower-based and MODIS estimates of annual GPP compare favorably for most biomes, although MODIS GPP overestimates tower-based calculations by 20%-30%. Seasonally, summer estimates of MODIS GPP are closest to tower data, and spring estimates are the worst, most likely the result of the relatively rapid onset of leaf-out. The results of this study indicate, however, that the current MODIS GPP algorithm shows reasonable spatial patterns and temporal variability across a diverse range of biomes and climate regimes. So, while continued efforts are needed to isolate particular problems in specific biomes, we are optimistic about the general quality of these data, and continuation of the MOD17 GPP product will likely provide a key component of global terrestrial ecosystem analysis, providing continuous weekly measurements of global vegetation production","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2005.853936","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1645290","AmeriFlux;gross primary production (GPP);Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS);remote sensing;Terra","Remote sensing;Productivity;MODIS;Poles and towers;Meteorology;Spectroradiometers;Production;Data assimilation;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical sensors","atmospheric chemistry;atmospheric composition;carbon compounds;vegetation mapping","remote sensing;terrestrial productivity;regional tower eddy flux network observations;Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer;MODIS;gross primary production;AD 2000 to 2003;CO2 eddy covariance flux;leaf area index;LAI;fPAR;land cover;NASA;Data Assimilation Office;DAO;tower-based meteorology;field optical measurements;forest classes;biomes;climate;global terrestrial ecosystem analysis;global vegetation production;AmeriFlux;net ecosystem exchange;Terra satellite;CO2","","417","","72","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Maintaining Security and Privacy of Patient Information","F. E. Ferrante","MSEE, MSEPP","2006 International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","","2006","","","4690","4690","As the global Internet evolves into today's more highly mobile and broadband service offerings, it is anticipated that the applications of new services to support telemedicine and eHealth operations using these offerings will result in increasing healthcare benefits for all and generally a lower cost. The one concern that must be addressed when making these changes is to ensure that security technology keeps up with the changes and provides the means by which satisfaction of HIPAA's privacy regulations can be assured. Consider the application of Wireless Communications in connecting medical professionals and patients through the ubiquitous web access arrangements. New products offered to patients and physicians alike are capable of transmitting vital signs, key blood test results for diabetics, blood pressure data, as well as the higher data requirements of X-Rays, MRIs, ultrasounds, CAT scans, and more. But now things are changing. Cell phones, hotspots (802.11 access arrangements) offer opportunities for others to intercept private information if not protected adequately. Today's security offering for wireless hotspots such as the Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) offers some security and privacy but it is known to be broken and useful only temporarily and not for protection of vital medical information protection. Currently, chips are being developed that will offer a much stronger protection for personal wireless networks. This recommended standard, referred to as 802.11i's WPA, is already supported within the Microsoft XP Operating System, and it will be enhanced and approved shortly by the latest recommended version of the standard offering WPA2 - for enterprise applications. The final version of 802.11i (WPA2) addresses practically all the vulnerabilities of WEP and more. However, now things are changing once more. A wideband wireless capability that in all likelihood will supercede WIFI within the next five years will allow up to 75 Mbps data transfer rates and support connections to systems in the range of 30 miles or more under the right conditions. In addition, speeding ambulances and cars traveling at speeds in excess of 70 MPH will be more readily capable of interfacing at the higher data rates WIMAX, the much-awaited technology that is expected to provide wireless broadband services on a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) scale is going to be the next wave of evolution (802.16). Once more, as was the case for WIFI, where is the security? Will the WIFi security offerings support that needed at these higher rates? All of this is yet to be assured. Thus privacy is once again of concern if the standards are not adequate. As planned however, it is my understanding that the new WPA2 will support both WiFi and WIMax security needs. As technology evolves, security must evolve. And if the manufacturers of products can settle on non-proprietary representative devices to support the needs of the medical field, then all will be fine. If they can't, or won't, then delays will occur. My presentation and discussion today will address some of the detail of this security and the issues yet to be faced in protecting medical and patient information","1557-170X","1-4244-0032-5","10.1109/IEMBS.2006.259655","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4462849","","Information security;Privacy;Protection;Data security;Communication system security;WiMAX;Web and internet services;Telemedicine;Medical services;Costs","broadband networks;health care;Internet;medical information systems;security of data;telemedicine;WiMax","patient information security;Internet;telemedicine;eHealth operation;healthcare;wireless communication;medical professional;ubiquitous web access;blood test result;diabetics;blood pressure data;X-Ray;MRI;ultrasound;CAT scan;wired equivalent privacy;WEP;medical information protection;personal wireless network;Microsoft XP operating system;enterprise application;WIMAX;wireless broadband service;metropolitan area network;WIFi security","","1","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sci., Queen's Univ. of Belfast, UK; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","","2006","54","4","1519","1536","In this paper, a robust watermarking algorithm using balanced multiwavelet transform is proposed. The latter transform achieves simultaneous orthogonality and symmetry without requiring any input prefiltering. Therefore, considerable reduction in computational complexity is possible, making this transform a good candidate for real-time watermarking implementations such as audio broadcast monitoring and DVD video watermarking. The embedding scheme is image adaptive using a modified version of a well-established perceptual model. Therefore, the strength of the embedded watermark is controlled according to the local properties of the host image. This has been achieved by the proposed perceptual model, which is only dependent on the image activity and is not dependent on the multifilter sets used, unlike those developed for scalar wavelets. This adaptivity is a key factor for achieving the imperceptibility requirement often encountered in watermarking applications. In addition, the watermark embedding scheme is based on the principles of spread-spectrum communications to achieve higher watermark robustness. The optimal bounds for the embedding capacity are derived using a statistical model for balanced multiwavelet coefficients of the host image. The statistical model is based on a generalized Gaussian distribution. Limits of data hiding capacity clearly show that balanced multiwavelets provide higher watermarking rates. This increase could also be exploited as a side channel for embedding watermark synchronization recovery data. Finally, the analytical expressions are contrasted with experimental results where the robustness of the proposed watermarking system is evaluated against standard watermarking attacks.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2006.870624","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1608564","Balanced multiwavelets;data hiding;embedding capacity;game theory;image watermarking;information theory;scalar wavelets","Digital images;Watermarking;Robustness;Computational complexity;Broadcasting;Monitoring;DVD;Spread spectrum communication;Gaussian distribution;Data encapsulation","image coding;data compression;watermarking;wavelet transforms;adaptive codes;spread spectrum communication;Gaussian distribution;synchronisation","digital image watermarking;balanced multiwavelets transform;image adaptive;spread-spectrum communications;generalized Gaussian distribution;embedding watermark synchronization","","111","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This limits the devices that can be fabricated because polysilicon is a common structural material in MEMS devices. In order to enhance the MEMS fabrication capabilities, expanding the use of Al as a structural layer has been researched. The main difficulty is the lack of a selective wet etch between the Al structural layer and the SiO2 sacrificial layer. In this study, seven etching solutions were studied on SiO2 and Al for their etch rates and selectivity. Two were buffered hydrofluoric acid (BHF) solutions with different concentrations of NH4F. Four were BHF solutions with propylene glycol or glycerin at different concentrations. The seventh solution was a commercial solution, Pad Etch 4. Among the seven etching solutions, 5:1 BHF gave the best selectivity between SiO2 and Al. Increasing the NH4F concentration from 5 to 7 parts did not increase the selectivity, but selectivity increased by adding NH4F in HF solution. Adding propylene glycol or glycerin to the 7:1 BHF solution did not increase the selectivity. When glycerin was added to 7:1 BHF solution it provided superior selectivity than was obtained from adding propylene glycol to 7:1 BHF. This paper will present the etch rates and selectivity of the 7 solutions along with comparisons with other published results.","2375-5350","1-4244-0267-0","10.1109/UGIM.2006.4286387","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4286387","","Micromechanical devices;Sputter etching;Wet etching;Hafnium;Fabrication;Anti-freeze;Microelectromechanical devices;Silicon compounds;Chemical technology;Aluminum","aluminium;etching;micromechanical devices;silicon compounds","NH4F - System;etch rates;selectivity;BHF solutions;buffered hydrofluoric acid;MEMS devices;etching solutions","","","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to accurately predict low-k TDDB reliability, it is crucial to clarify the electric field dependence and temperature dependence of time-to-breakdown. In this study, bias-temperature stresses of CVD low-k SiCOH dielectric at the 65nm technology node were conducted over a wide range of fields and temperatures. Based on the extensive long-term test results (longer than one year), it was found that the ""square-root of E"" (radicE) dependence seems to be the best choice for modeling field dependent TDDB data. It was also determined that the TDDB activation energy is dependent on electric field, and that the field acceleration parameter for the radicE model decreases with increasing temperature. The physical mechanism behind radicE and the role of Cu diffusion during bias-temperature-stress are discussed, and an electron-fluence-driven, Cu-catalyzed SiCOH breakdown model is introduced. Finally, it is emphasized that great care must be taken in evaluating low-k dielectric TDDB when different stress fields and temperatures are used for chip operational lifetime projections","1938-1891","0-7803-9498-4","10.1109/RELPHY.2006.251190","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4017131","time-dependent dielectric breakdown;Cu interconnect;reliability;metal diffusion;electrochemical reaction;low-k;ILD;process integration","Acceleration;Dielectric breakdown;Dielectric materials;Thermal stresses;Temperature dependence;Electric breakdown;Microelectronics;Qualifications;Temperature distribution;Testing","copper;electric breakdown;reliability;silicon compounds","low-k SiCOH TDDB phenomena;reliability lifetime model development;bias-temperature stresses;CVD;square-root of E;electric field;time-dependent dielectric breakdown;Cu interconnect;metal diffusion;electrochemical reaction;process integration;65 nm;SiCOH;Cu","","107","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In OOK, the bandwidth requirement is roughly equivalent to the data rate (Rb,). PPM achieves higher average power efficiency than OOK at the expense of an increased bandwidth (x4) compared to OOK. Besides, the use of PPM imposes more system complexity compared to OOK since both slot- and symbol-level synchronizations, critical to system performance, are required at the receiver. Unlike PPM, DPIM does not require symbol synchronization since each symbol is initiated with a pulse. Furthermore, DPIM displays a higher transmission capacity by eliminating all the unused time slots from within each symbol. In terms of BER, 4-DPIM displays a performance in between that of OOK and PPM. It is concluded that DPIM is the most efficient scheme in terms of transmission capacity and band-width requirements. When it comes to power and error performance, PPM is the best among the three schemes.","","978-1-4244-0526-8","10.1109/SCORED.2006.4339297","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4339297","Modulation schemes;transmission capacity;bandwidth requirement and power efficiency","Digital modulation;Wireless communication;Optical fiber communication;Bandwidth;Displays;Optical modulation;Optical receivers;Capacity planning;Error probability;System performance","amplitude shift keying;error statistics;optical communication;optical modulation;pulse position modulation","wireless optical communications;digital modulation;on-off keying;OOK;pulse position modulation;PPM;digital pulse interval modulation;DPIM displays;bit error probability;power efficiency;slot-level synchronizations;symbol-level synchronizations;transmission capacity","","20","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main advantage of such linear regulators is the low standby current due to the absence of switching. In addition, a fully integrated linear regulator with no external components is very attractive for applications with stringent area, low weight requirements and relatively small peak power. The architecture of error amplifier used in the feedback loop suffers from an inherent load regulation performance limitation. This limitation manifests itself through the limited DC open-loop gain, and results from limited closed-loop bandwidth. The frequency response of power supply loop is highly sensitive to the load conditions, thus, making proper compensation is a laborious effort. This paper discusses and addresses a new topology of an error amplifier offering a high open loop gain as well as a large band width by adding a zero to its transfer function. Proposed topology uses a compound OTA and OPAMP that enhances load regulation performance by relaxing the dc open-loop gain restrictions. An example of battery charger using this opamp topology is also described in this paper.

Unlike traditional discrete emotion simulations, this paper attempts to synthesize emotional speech by using ""strong"", ""medium"", and ""weak"" classifications. This paper tests different models, a linear modification model (LMM), a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and a classification and regression tree (CART) model. The linear modification model makes direct modification of sentence F0 contours and syllabic durations from acoustic distributions of emotional speech, such as, F0 topline, F0 baseline, durations, and intensities. Further analysis shows that emotional speech is also related to stress and linguistic information. Unlike the linear modification method, the GMM and CART models try to map the subtle prosody distributions between neutral and emotional speech. While the GMM just uses the features, the CART model integrates linguistic features into the mapping. A pitch target model which is optimized to describe Mandarin F0 contours is also introduced. For all conversion methods, a deviation of perceived expressiveness (DPE) measure is created to evaluate the expressiveness of the output speech. The results show that the LMM gives the worst results among the three methods. The GMM method is more suitable for a small training set, while the CART method gives the better emotional speech output if trained with a large context-balanced corpus. The methods discussed in this paper indicate ways to generate emotional speech in speech synthesis. The objective and subjective evaluation processes are also analyzed.

Thus, in many engineering reliability experiments, measures of degradation or wear toward failure can often be observed over a period of time before failure occurs. Because the degradation values provide additional information beyond that provided by the failure observations, both sets of observations need to be considered when doing inference on the statistical parameters of the product or system lifetime distributions. For highly-reliable modern products, it often takes much more time to obtain lifetime & degradation data under usual use conditions, and this requires one to use accelerated tests. Accelerated tests expose the products to greater environmental stress levels so that we can obtain lifetime & degradation measurements in a more timely fashion. In addition, many products are exposed to several environmental variables in some manufacturing processes, or under some operating conditions. This motivates the need for developing general accelerated test models with several accelerating variables for inference based on both observed failure values, and degradation measurements. In this paper, new accelerated test models are developed based on a generalized cumulative damage approach with a stochastic process characterizing a degradation phenomenon.","1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2006.874937","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1638421","Accelerated testing;Brownian motion process;cumulative damage;degradation process;first passage time;gamma process;geometric Brownian motion process;inverse Gaussian distribution;stochastic process","Stochastic processes;Degradation;Acceleration;Life estimation;Time measurement;Life testing;Power system modeling;Stress measurement;Accelerometers;Reliability engineering","reliability theory;failure analysis;life testing;Gaussian distribution;Gaussian processes;Brownian motion","stochastic process;degradation phenomenon;engineering reliability;failure observation;wear;lifetime distribution;accelerated testing;products;environmental stress;manufacturing process;generalized cumulative damage approach;Brownian motion process;gamma process;inverse Gaussian distribution","","152","","41","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For operation at 1.8 GHz DECT, the capacitor is feedback to both transistors of the cascaded LNA and as for 2.4 GHz WLAN application, the capacitor is feedback to only one of the transistors. Two switches are employed to control the connection of the feedback capacitor to the LNA. By switching the connection of the feedback capacitor, the narrow-band gain and impedance matching are achieved at both 1.8 GHz and 2.4 GHz frequency bands. The LNA has been simulated using 0.18 μm CMOS technology and results attained for both two bands are as followed; gain, S21 = 21 dB, noise figure, NF = 0.8 dB and linearity with third-order intercept point, IIP3 =- 0.13 dBm.

A novel edge-based tracker dispenses with the conventional edge model, and uses instead a coarse, but textured, 3D model. This yields several advantages: scale-based detail culling is automatic, appearance-based edge signatures can be used to improve matching and the models needed are more commonly available.

Two-port S-parameter measurements (8.2-10 GHz) were conducted on three material samples in single and multilayer arrangements. The algorithm accurately extracted the complex constitutive parameters for each layer. These values were then compared with values extracted using a modified short-circuit line (SCL) method (single-layer cases only).

A full-wave simulator is used to design the proposed structure and calculate the aperture coupling coefficients. With this two-layer configuration, the proposed filter becomes very compact and occupies a small space. To demonstrate the proposed design, a four-order bandpass-filter prototype was designed, fabricated, and tested at 2.14 GHz. Furthermore, a single-layer filter prototype was also designed and fabricated at the same frequency band and then compared to the first one. As a result, a significant reduction of approximately 50% was achieved. These features make the proposed structure suitable for compact and high-performance circuit component designs in microwave circuits.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2006.872797","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1629033","Microstrip filters;miniaturized circuits;multilayer configurations;stepped-impedance resonators (SIRs)","Microstrip filters;Microstrip resonators;Band pass filters;Filtering theory;Couplings;Apertures;Prototypes;Microwave circuits;Resonator filters;Etching","microstrip filters;band-pass filters;UHF filters;microstrip resonators;resonator filters;poles and zeros","microstrip filters;two-layer bandpass filter;aperture-coupled SIR-hairpin resonators;transmission zeros;microstrip resonators;stepped-impedance resonators;three coupling apertures;common ground plane;full-wave simulator;aperture coupling coefficients;two-layer configuration;four-order bandpass-filter;single-layer filter;microwave circuits;2.14 GHz","","50","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on detailed analysis of commuting process of conventional STATCOM, the authors find that as STATCOM operated in the state of absorb reactive power, only turn-on signals is available, and turn-off signals have no effects. And when STATCOM generates reactive power, only turn-off signals are available. Hence, this paper proposed a new kind of STATCOM, where thyristors instead of self-commutated devices are used as switching devices. Simulation and experimental results show that such a thyristor-based VSC (voltage source converter) STATCOM can absorb inductive reactive power by adjusting its fire angle and has the same characteristics as ordinary STATCOM within its inductive operating range, so the thyristor- based STATCOM can be used for static var compensation in power systems.","","1-4244-0110-0","10.1109/ICPST.2006.321762","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4115957","STATCOM;Static Var Compensation;Flexible AC Transmission System","Automatic voltage control;Reactive power;Signal processing;Power system simulation;Signal analysis;Power generation;Signal generators;Thyristors;Converters;Power conversion","flexible AC transmission systems;reactive power;static VAr compensators;thyristor convertors","thyristor-based STATCOM;FACTS;China;reactive power;switching devices;VSC;voltage source converter;fire angle;static var compensation","","10","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Employing dynamic reuse of spectral resources, we impose a peak power constraint at each base station and allow for coordination between the base stations. By an analytical derivation we find that the optimal power allocation then has a remarkably simple nature: Depending on the noise and channel gains, transmit at full power only at base station 1 or base station 2, or both. Utilizing the optimal power allocation we study optimal link adaptation, and compare to adaptive transmission without power control. Results show that allowing for power control significantly increases the overall capacity for an average user pair, in addition to considerable power savings. Furthermore, we investigate power adaptation in combination with scheduling of users in a time slotted system. Specifically, the capacity-optimal single-cell scheduler [1] is generalized to the two-cell case. Thus, both power allocation and multiuser diversity are exploited to give substantial network capacity gains.","","0-7803-9549-2","10.1109/WIOPT.2006.1666517","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1666517","","Base stations;Interference constraints;Power control;Iterative algorithms;Throughput;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Resource management;Telecommunications;Mobile communication","","","","91","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we design a novel routing algorithm, called adaptive fusion Steiner tree (AFST), for energy efficient data gathering. Not only does AFST jointly optimize over the costs for both data transmission and fusion, but also AFST evaluates the benefit and cost of data fusion along information routes and adaptively adjusts whether fusion shall be performed at a particular node.

The function relating the synchronous-rectifier timing to the load current is optimized on-line with a gradient power-loss-minimizing algorithm. Only low-bandwidth measurements of the load current and a power-loss-related quantity are required, making the technique suitable for digital controller implementations. Compared to alternative loss-minimizing approaches, this method has superior adjustment speed and robustness to disturbances, and can simultaneously optimize multiple parameters. The proposed synchronous-rectifier control also accomplishes an automatic, optimal transition to discontinuous-conduction mode at light load. Further, by imposing a minimum duty-ratio, the converter automatically enters pulse-skipping mode at very light load. Thus, the same controller structure can be used in both fixed-frequency pulsewidth modulation and variable-frequency pulse-skipping modes.

In conjunction with centralized processing, MIMO radar has the potential to significantly improve radar functions such as detection and parameter estimation. MIMO radar is distinct from other types of array radars such as phased array or STAP, which process the signals of closely spaced elements and, hence, cannot capitalize on the spatial characteristics of targets. In this work, we explore the ability of MIMO radar and coherent processing to locate a target with high resolution and to resolve targets located in the same range cell. A distributed target model is developed. It is demonstrated that MIMO radar with centralized coherent processing is able to resolve scatterers with a range resolution well beyond that supported by the signal bandwidth. The location estimation capabilities are further illustrated by introducing a new two-dimensional ambiguity function. The analysis is discussed in the context of established results for randomly thinned arrays. The investigation of high resolution MIMO radar also includes comparison with the performance of non-coherent MIMO radar and the effect on performance of the number of sensors and their locations.","1058-6393","1-4244-0784-2","10.1109/ACSSC.2006.356576","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4176505","","MIMO;Signal resolution;Phased arrays;Spatial resolution;Radar signal processing;Spaceborne radar;Signal processing;Radar scattering;Transmitters;Backscatter","MIMO communication;radar equipment","MIMO radar;radar backscatter;multistatic architecture;location estimation","","134","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An effective method to model weather's impact on overhead distribution lines' failure rates will enable utilities to compare their systems' reliabilities under different weather conditions. This will allow them to make the right decisions to obtain the best operation and maintenance plan to reduce impacts of weather on reliabilities. Two methods to model overhead distribution lines' failure rates are presented in this paper. The first is based on a Poisson regression model, and it captures the counting nature of failure events on overhead distribution lines. The second is a Bayesian network model, which uses conditional probabilities of failures given different weather states.

In particular, an array of solar cells is employed as an alternative renewable resource (ARR) to provide clean electric energy to remote rural residential or industrial nonlinear loads. The approach employs a series-combined connected boost and buck-boost dc-dc converter for power conditioning of the dc voltage provided by a photo-voltaic array. The input voltage to the combined converters is 100 V provided from two series-connected PV cells, which is converted and increased to 400 V at the dc output voltage. Series-combined connected boost and buck-boost dc-dc converters operate in alternate fashion each other. This helps to reduce the input ripple current and provide the required 400 Vdc on a sinusoidal PWM three-phase inverter. Analysis of the two series-combined dc-dc converters is presented along with simulation results.

The self-coupling between ring segments provides the same mode perturbation effect as the conventional methods of adding stub, cutting notch, or varying line impedance on the ring resonator. The mode perturbation and transmission-zero generation due to the self-coupling effect are analyzed with the even-odd mode theory. The self-coupled ring resonator can have the capacitive or inductive perturbation simply by controlling the impedance ratio and coupling coefficients of self-coupled sections. For both perturbation cases, the transmission zeros exist at even multiples of the passband center frequency, resulting in wide stopband range. Also, only for the capacitive perturbation case, two transmission zeros are found on both sides of the passband, which brings a pseudo-elliptic bandpass response. In comparison with the regular uniform ring resonator, the self-coupled ring resonator takes shorter ring length, giving the compact size feature when applied to a bandpass filter design.

Total harmonic distortion, which is directly related to the power factor, is adopted as the objective function.

The mobility model represents the moving behavior of each mobile node (MN) in the MANET that should be realistic. It is a crucial part in the performance evaluation of MANET. Random waypoint mobility model is the only mobility model that has been widely used in the simulation study of MANET despite some unrealistic movement behaviors such as sudden stop and sharp turn. Whilst Gauss-Markov mobility model has been proved that it can solve both of these problems. This paper presents a comparative simulation study of random waypoint and Gauss-Markov mobility models on the performance study of MANET that uses ad-hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) as the routing protocol. The results show that both mobility models are not different in case each MN is moving at human running speed. Therefore, it is suggested to use random waypoint mobility model because of its less computational overhead comparing to Gauss-Markov mobility model. When the speed of MNs is as high as fast automobiles, the performance result using random waypoint mobility model is significant different from Gauss-Markov mobility model. Therefore, Gauss-Markov mobility model should be used instead. Moreover, different levels of randomness setting have no effect on the accuracy of throughput and end-to-end delay","","0-7803-9740-1","10.1109/ISCIT.2006.339866","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4141345","","Gaussian processes;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Information technology;Centralized control;Mobile communication;Electronic mail;Humans;Automobiles;Throughput","ad hoc networks;Gaussian processes;Markov processes;mobile radio;routing protocols","random waypoint model;Gauss-Markov mobility models;MANET;mobile ad hoc network;wireless mobile nodes;ad-hoc on-demand distance vector;routing protocol;end-to-end delay","","48","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

According to the concepts of mechanical geometry and motion dynamics, the dynamic model of an n-link robot manipulator including actuator dynamics is introduced initially. However, it is difficult to design a suitable model-based control scheme due to the uncertainties in practical applications, such as friction forces, external disturbances, and parameter variations. In order to deal with the mentioned difficulties, a robust neural-fuzzy-network control (RNFNC) system is investigated to the joint position control of an n-link robot manipulator for periodic motion. In this control scheme, a four-layer neural fuzzy network (NFN) is utilized for the major control role, and the adaptive tuning laws of network parameters are derived in the sense of a projection algorithm and the Lyapunov stability theorem to ensure network convergence as well as stable control performance. The merits of this model-free control scheme are that not only can the stable position tracking performance be guaranteed but also no prior system information and auxiliary control design are required in the control process. In addition, numerical simulations and experimental results of a two-link robot manipulator actuated by dc servo motors are provided to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed RNFNC methodology","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2006.878297","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1667930","Adaptive tuning algorithm;dc servo motors;Lyapunov stability theorem;neural fuzzy network;robot manipulator","Manipulator dynamics;Robust control;Robot control;Actuators;Intelligent control;Intelligent robots;Computational geometry;Solid modeling;Force control;Uncertainty","actuators;control system synthesis;DC motors;fuzzy neural nets;intelligent control;Lyapunov methods;manipulators;neurocontrollers;numerical analysis;position control;robot dynamics;robust control;servomotors","robust neural fuzzy neural network control;n-link robot manipulators;actuator dynamics;intelligent control systems;high-precision position tracking;mechanical geometry;motion dynamics;model-based control scheme;joint position control;four-layer neural fuzzy network;adaptive tuning;Lyapunov stability theorem;auxiliary control design;DC servo motors","","94","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

From a computer vision perspective, this task is extremely challenging because it is massively ill-posed - at each pixel we must estimate the foreground and the background colors, as well as the foreground opacity (""alpha matte"") from a single color measurement. Current approaches either restrict the estimation to a small part of the image, estimating foreground and background colors based on nearby pixels where they are known, or perform iterative nonlinear estimation by alternating foreground and background color estimation with alpha estimation. In this paper we present a closed form solution to natural image matting. We derive a cost function from local smoothness assumptions on foreground and background colors, and show that in the resulting expression it is possible to analytically eliminate the foreground and background colors to obtain a quadratic cost function in alpha. This allows us to find the globally optimal alpha matte by solving a sparse linear system of equations. Furthermore, the closed form formula allows us to predict the properties of the solution by analyzing the eigenvectors of a sparse matrix, closely related to matrices used in spectral image segmentation algorithms. We show that high quality mattes can be obtained on natural images from a surprisingly small amount of user input.","1063-6919","0-7695-2597-0","10.1109/CVPR.2006.18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1640742","","Closed-form solution;Cost function;Image color analysis;Sparse matrices;Computer vision;Pixel;Iterative methods;Linear systems;Equations;Image analysis","","","","229","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, the problem of detecting the changes that occurred on the ground by analyzing SAR imagery is addressed by a completely unsupervised approach, i.e., by developing an automatic thresholding technique. The image-ratioing approach to SAR change detection is adopted, and the Kittler and Illingworth minimum-error thresholding algorithm is generalized to take into account the non-Gaussian distribution of the amplitude values of SAR images.

As a result, a three-pole Chebyshev net-type resonator filter with a fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 6.8% has a spurious resonance of up to 4.1f/sub 0/, and it has more than 80% size reduction in comparison with the conventional U-shaped resonator filter. A four-pole quasi-elliptic net-type resonator filter with a FBW of 3.5% has a spurious resonance of up to 5f/sub 0/, and it has approximately 67% size reduction in comparison with the cross-coupled open-loop resonator filter. A three-pole trisection net-type resonator filter with a FBW of 4.7% has a spurious resonance of up to 6.5f/sub 0/, and its size is reduced by 68% in comparison with the trisection open-loop resonator filter. Consequently, each of the designed filters occupies a very small circuit size and has a good stopband response. The measured results are in good agreement with the full-wave simulation results by IE3D.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2005.862626","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1589501","Coupling coefficient;external quality factor;microstrip filter;net-type resonator","Microstrip filters;Microstrip resonators;Band pass filters;Resonator filters;Resonance;Chebyshev approximation;Structural engineering;Resonant frequency;Bandwidth;Circuits","resonator filters;microstrip resonators;microstrip filters;band-pass filters;Chebyshev filters","microstrip bandpass filters;filter design;filter fabrication;spurious frequency;fractional bandwidth;coupling coefficient;external quality factor;three-pole Chebyshev net-type resonator filter;three-pole trisection net-type resonator filter","","39","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus the UPQC can work in zero active power consumption mode, active power absorption mode and active power delivering mode.

Such multi-phase motor drives are nowadays considered for various applications. Multi-phase drives are invariably supplied from multi-phase voltage source inverters (VSIs) and adequate methods for VSI pulse width modulation (PWM) are therefore required. This paper deals with carrier-based PWM, where harmonic injection enables an improvement in the dc bus utilisation without moving into the over-modulation region, while still providing sinusoidal output phase voltages. A generalised concept of nth harmonic injection for n-phase inverters is presented. The viability of the proposed concept is proved by simulation taking five-phase VSI as an example. The method of fifth-harmonic injection in five-phase VSIs enables operation with pure sinusoidal voltages up to a certain reference voltage value which is smaller than the maximum achievable with the given dc link voltage. Sinusoidal PWM is further modified, by injecting other harmonics, in order to enable full utilisation of the dc bus voltage. The correlation of this PWM scheme with space vector PWM, based on utilisation of large vectors only, is established in this way. Some experimental results, illustrating application of the sinusoidal PWM in series-connected five-phase two-motor drives, are included.","2377-6617","0-7803-9716-9","10.1109/pesc.2006.1712206","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1712206","","Harmonic analysis;Space vector pulse width modulation;Inverters;Legged locomotion;Stators","","","","56","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

More specifically, reactive routing protocols has to flood the network with a route request (RREQ) message in order to find an optimal route to the destination. Several applications developed for vehicular ad hoc wireless networks (VANET), which is a subset of MANET, rely on broadcast to propagate useful traffic information to other vehicles located within a certain geographical area. However, the conventional broadcast mechanism may lead to the so-called broadcast storm problem. In this paper, we explore how serious the broadcast storm problem is in both MANET and VANET by examining how broadcast packets propagate in a 2-dimensional open area and on a straight road or highway scenarios. In addition, we propose three novel distributed broadcast suppression techniques; i.e., weighted p-persistence, slotted 1-persistence, and slotted p- persistence schemes. Our simulation results show that the proposed schemes can achieve up to 90% reduction in packet loss rate while keeping the end-to-end delay at acceptable levels for most VANET applications. They can also be used together with the route discovery process to guide the routing protocols to select routes with fewer hop counts.","","978-1-4244-0424-7","10.1109/BROADNETS.2006.4374403","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4374403","","Broadcasting;Storms;Wireless networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Delay;Time factors;Electronic mail;Telecommunication traffic;Vehicles","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication traffic","broadcast storm problem;routing protocols;broadcast transmission;route request;RREQ;vehicular ad hoc wireless networks;VANET;MANET;traffic information;distributed broadcast suppression techniques;weighted p-persistence;slotted l-persistence;slotted p- persistence schemes;end-to-end delay;route discovery process","","120","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The energization can lead to excessive transient inrush current, especially when the transformer core has remnant flux that adds to the flux build-up after switching. Inrush current sags the system voltage, thereby affecting the power quality of the network in proximity of the transformer. The extent to which power quality is degraded depends on short circuit MVA at the source bus, and the magnitude and decay time constant of the transient current. Present day thyristor-controlled machinery used in mining, pulp and paper industries and semiconductor manufacturing require high quality power. Some of these industries even pay a premium price for high quality power. It is, therefore, necessary to first assess the impact of energizing a large transformer on power quality and then develop a technique to limit this impact. This paper presents results from field tests and simulations using Electromagnetic Transients Program a 138 kV 315 MVA transformer energization in the BC Hydro system.

Functional research on geographic routing has already reached a considerable level, whereas security aspects have been vastly neglected so far. Since position dissemination is crucial for geographic routing, forged position information has severe impact regarding both performance and security. In this work, we first analyze the problems that may arise from falsified position data. Then, in order to lessen these problems, we propose detection mechanisms that are capable of recognizing nodes cheating about their location in position beacons.

The data were then converted into a voxel-based three-dimensional model that reproduced the tree precisely, including within the canopy. This precise voxel model allowed the LAD and LAI of these trees, which have extremely dense and nonrandomly distributed foliage, to be computed by direct counting of the beam-contact frequency in each layer using a point-quadrat method. Corrections for leaf inclination and nonphotosynthetic tissues reduced the estimation error. A beam incident zenith angle near 57.5deg offered a good correction for leaf inclination without knowledge of the actual leaf inclination.

We present IKM, an ID-based key management scheme as a novel combination of ID-based and threshold cryptography. IKM is a certificateless solution in that public keys of mobile nodes are directly derivable from their known IDs plus some common information. It thus eliminates the need for certificate-based authenticated public-key distribution indispensable in conventional public-key management schemes. IKM features a novel construction method of ID-based public/private keys, which not only ensures high-level tolerance to node compromise, but also enables efficient network-wide key update via a single broadcast message.

The application of the system, however, is handicapped by the difficulty of starting under full load due to the unknown initial rotor position. This paper presents a nonlinear model of PMSMs which incorporates both the structural and saturation saliencies to enable the numerical simulation of initial rotor position detection algorithms. In this model, the phase inductances are expressed by Fourier series as functions of the stator current and rotor position. The inductances of a surface mounted PMSM is measured with different rotor positions and DC offset currents, which emulate the effect of the three phase stator currents. By using the proposed model, the DTC PMSM is simulated and the results are compared with those obtained by the PMSM model in the Simulink library. With the model, an initial rotor position estimation scheme using voltage pulses is investigated by numerical simulation. The scheme is also experimentally tested and the results are compared with the inductance variation to verify the validity of the method. The effectiveness of the scheme to estimate the initial rotor position for the testing SPMSM is analyzed and verified by numerical simulation before physical implementation","0197-2618","1-4244-0364-2","10.1109/IAS.2006.256487","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4025190","PMSM model;structural saliency;saturation saliency;inductance;direct torque control;initial rotor position estimation","Control system synthesis;Torque control;Sensorless control;Numerical simulation;Stators;Testing;Control systems;Permanent magnet motors;Rotors;Detection algorithms","Fourier series;inductance;machine control;permanent magnet motors;rotors;stators;synchronous motor drives;torque control","direct torque controlled PMSM drive system;structural saliency;saturation saliency;permanent magnet synchronous motor drive;sensorless control algorithm;PMSM nonlinear model;initial rotor position detection algorithm;phase inductance;Fourier series;three phase stator current;initial rotor position estimation scheme;voltage pulse;numerical simulation;inductance variation","","9","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Particularly, the overall control system of the DFIM is modeled in detail, so that tuning equations that allow adjusting the parameters of its proportional-integral (PI) compensators straightforwardly are provided. In addition to validating the wind generator model proposed, experimental tests carried out on a 660-kW doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) prove that such a control system makes it possible to govern separately its stator-side or net active and reactive powers. The two wind farm models proposed, which are assumed to be made up of DFIM type generators exclusively, are mainly devised to assist the design and test of closed-loop control algorithms for the wind farm total power factor. They generally imply significantly different computational loads, so that the second may be regarded as a simplified version of the first one. The net active and reactive power performances of both wind farm models are finally compared via simulation, which allows identifying the stronger and weaker points associated to each model","1558-0059","","10.1109/TEC.2005.859975","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4012129","Active power;doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs);pole assignmen;reactive power;simplified model;vector control;wind farms;wind power generation","Wind farms;Reactive power;Performance evaluation;Power system modeling;Induction generators;Stators;Control system synthesis;Power generation;Wind energy generation;Induction machines","asynchronous machines;closed loop systems;PI control;reactive power;stators;wind power plants","active power;reactive power performance;stator flux oriented electromechanical model;double fed induction machines;proportional integral compensators;wind generator model;closed-loop control algorithms;wind farm total power factor;660 kW","","70","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"A Novel Mechatronic Body Weight Support System","M. Frey; G. Colombo; M. Vaglio; R. Bucher; M. Jorg; R. Riener","Swiss Fed. Inst. of Technol., Zurich; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","","2006","14","3","311","321","A novel mechatronic body weight support (BWS) system has been developed to provide precise body weight unloading for patients with neurological or other impairments during treadmill training. The system is composed of a passive elastic spring element to take over the main unloading force and an active closed-loop controlled electric drive to generate the exact desired force. Both force generating units, the passive spring and the active electric drive, act on the patient via a polyester rope connected to a harness worn by the patient. The length of the rope can be adjusted with an electric winch to adapt the system to different patient sizes. The system is fully computer controlled. At unloading loads of up to 60 kg and walking speeds of up to 3.2 km/h, the mean unloading error and the maximum unloading error of the presented BWS system was less than 1 and 3 kg, respectively. The performance was compared with those of two purely passive BWS systems currently being used by most other rehabilitation groups. This comprised counterweight systems and static BWS systems with fixed rope lengths. Counterweight systems reached mean and maximum unloading errors of up to 5.34 and 16.22 kg, respectively. The values for the static BWS were 11.02 kg and 27.67 kg, respectively. The novel mechatronic BWS system presented in this study adjusts desired unloading changes of up to 20 kg within less than 100 ms. Thus, not only constant BWS, but also gait cycle dependent or time variant oscillations of the desired force can be realized with high accuracy. Precise and constant unloading force is believed to be an important prerequisite for BWS gait therapy, where it is important to generate physiologically correct segmental dynamics and ground reaction forces. Thus, the novel BWS system presented in this paper is an important contribution to maximize the therapeutic outcome of human gait rehabilitation","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2006.881556","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1703563","Dynamic body weight support (BWS);force control;ground reaction force;rehabilitation of neurological impairments;rehabilitation robotics;treadmill training","Mechatronics;Force control;Hospitals;Leg;Springs;Control systems;Legged locomotion;Computer errors;Winches;Medical treatment","electric drives;gait analysis;mechatronics;medical robotics;patient rehabilitation","mechatronic body weight support system;precise body weight unloading;neurological impairments;treadmill training;passive elastic spring element;unloading force;active closed-loop controlled electric drive;polyester rope;walking;human gait rehabilitation;physiologically correct segmental dynamics;ground reaction forces;60 kg","Biomechanical Phenomena;Body Weight;Electronics;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Exercise Test;Exercise Test;Humans;Physical Stimulation;Physical Stimulation;Physical Therapy Modalities;Restraint, Physical;Restraint, Physical;Robotics;Robotics;Stress, Mechanical;Therapy, Computer-Assisted;Therapy, Computer-Assisted","114","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The identification time depends on the number of feature vectors, their dimensionality, the complexity of the speaker models and the number of speakers. In this paper, we concentrate on optimizing vector quantization (VQ) based speaker identification. We reduce the number of test vectors by pre-quantizing the test sequence prior to matching, and the number of speakers by pruning out unlikely speakers during the identification process. The best variants are then generalized to Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based modeling. We apply the algorithms also to efficient cohort set search for score normalization in speaker verification. We obtain a speed-up factor of 16:1 in the case of VQ-based modeling with minor degradation in the identification accuracy, and 34:1 in the case of GMM-based modeling.

One of the particular problems H-bridge based STATCOMs have when used in these applications is maintaining correct voltages on the H-bridge capacitors for each of the individual phases of the STATCOM. This difficulty is the result of average real power flowing in or out of the individual phase legs. A solution has already been published for the delta connected STATCOM, but has not, until this paper, been solved for the wye connected topology. This paper uses a new approach to solve the phase leg power balance problem using zero sequence current and voltage injection.
