"A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II","K. Deb; A. Pratap; S. Agarwal; T. Meyarivan","Kanpur Genetic Algorithms Lab., Indian Inst. of Technol., Kanpur, India; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","","2002","6","2","182","197","Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) that use non-dominated sorting and sharing have been criticized mainly for: (1) their O(MN/sup 3/) computational complexity (where M is the number of objectives and N is the population size); (2) their non-elitism approach; and (3) the need to specify a sharing parameter. In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN/sup 2/) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N solutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on difficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed.","1941-0026","","10.1109/4235.996017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=996017","","Genetic algorithms;Sorting;Computational complexity;Evolutionary computation;Computational modeling;Testing;Decision making;Associate members;Diversity reception;Constraint optimization","genetic algorithms;operations research;computational complexity;Pareto distribution;simulation;convergence;constraint theory;sorting","fast elitist multi-objective genetic algorithm;NSGA-II;Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II;multi-objective evolutionary algorithm;nondominated sharing;computational complexity;objectives;population size;selection operator;mating pool;parent/offspring population combination;solution fitness;solution spread;simulation;convergence;Pareto-optimal front;Pareto-archived evolution strategy;strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm;dominance definition;constrained multi-objective problems;nonlinear problem;multi-objective optimization;algorithm performance;constraint handling;multi-criterion decision making","","17996","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Organ., Adelaide, SA, Australia; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","","2002","50","2","174","188","Increasingly, for many application areas, it is becoming important to include elements of nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity in order to model accurately the underlying dynamics of a physical system. Moreover, it is typically crucial to process data on-line as it arrives, both from the point of view of storage costs as well as for rapid adaptation to changing signal characteristics. In this paper, we review both optimal and suboptimal Bayesian algorithms for nonlinear/non-Gaussian tracking problems, with a focus on particle filters. Particle filters are sequential Monte Carlo methods based on point mass (or ""particle"") representations of probability densities, which can be applied to any state-space model and which generalize the traditional Kalman filtering methods. Several variants of the particle filter such as SIR, ASIR, and RPF are introduced within a generic framework of the sequential importance sampling (SIS) algorithm. These are discussed and compared with the standard EKF through an illustrative example.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.978374","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=978374","","Tutorial;Particle filters;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Costs;Signal processing;Bayesian methods;Particle tracking;Kalman filters;Filtering;Monte Carlo methods","filtering theory;tracking filters;Kalman filters;Monte Carlo methods;state-space methods;state estimation;Bayes methods;importance sampling","particle filters;suboptimal Bayesian algorithms;optimal Bayesian algorithms;nonlinear tracking problems;nonGaussian tracking problems;sequential Monte Carlo methods;point mass representations;probability densities;state-space model;Kalman filtering;sequential importance sampling;tutorial","","6598","","43","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method is based on recognizing that certain local binary patterns, termed ""uniform,"" are fundamental properties of local image texture and their occurrence histogram is proven to be a very powerful texture feature. We derive a generalized gray-scale and rotation invariant operator presentation that allows for detecting the ""uniform"" patterns for any quantization of the angular space and for any spatial resolution and presents a method for combining multiple operators for multiresolution analysis. The proposed approach is very robust in terms of gray-scale variations since the operator is, by definition, invariant against any monotonic transformation of the gray scale. Another advantage is computational simplicity as the operator can be realized with a few operations in a small neighborhood and a lookup table. Experimental results demonstrate that good discrimination can be achieved with the occurrence statistics of simple rotation invariant local binary patterns.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2002.1017623","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1017623","","Gray-scale;Spatial resolution;Prototypes;Pattern recognition;Image recognition;Image texture;Histograms;Quantization;Multiresolution analysis;Robustness","image texture;image classification;invariance;nonparametric statistics","multiresolution gray-scale texture classification;rotation invariant texture classification;local binary patterns;nonparametric discrimination;sample distributions;prototype distributions;local image texture;occurrence histogram;uniform patterns;angular space;spatial resolution;multiresolution analysis;gray-scale variations;computational simplicity","","8223","","39","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A popular heuristic for k-means clustering is Lloyd's (1982) algorithm. We present a simple and efficient implementation of Lloyd's k-means clustering algorithm, which we call the filtering algorithm. This algorithm is easy to implement, requiring a kd-tree as the only major data structure. We establish the practical efficiency of the filtering algorithm in two ways. First, we present a data-sensitive analysis of the algorithm's running time, which shows that the algorithm runs faster as the separation between clusters increases.

In our framework, the measurement of similarity is preceded by: (1) solving for correspondences between points on the two shapes; (2) using the correspondences to estimate an aligning transform. In order to solve the correspondence problem, we attach a descriptor, the shape context, to each point. The shape context at a reference point captures the distribution of the remaining points relative to it, thus offering a globally discriminative characterization. Corresponding points on two similar shapes will have similar shape contexts, enabling us to solve for correspondences as an optimal assignment problem. Given the point correspondences, we estimate the transformation that best aligns the two shapes; regularized thin-plate splines provide a flexible class of transformation maps for this purpose. The dissimilarity between the two shapes is computed as a sum of matching errors between corresponding points, together with a term measuring the magnitude of the aligning transform. We treat recognition in a nearest-neighbor classification framework as the problem of finding the stored prototype shape that is maximally similar to that in the image.

How to effectively extend it for multiclass classification is still an ongoing research issue. Several methods have been proposed where typically we construct a multiclass classifier by combining several binary classifiers. Some authors also proposed methods that consider all classes at once. As it is computationally more expensive to solve multiclass problems, comparisons of these methods using large-scale problems have not been seriously conducted. Especially for methods solving multiclass SVM in one step, a much larger optimization problem is required so up to now experiments are limited to small data sets. In this paper we give decomposition implementations for two such ""all-together"" methods. We then compare their performance with three methods based on binary classifications: ""one-against-all,"" ""one-against-one,"" and directed acyclic graph SVM (DAGSVM).

Channel estimation based on a comb type pilot arrangement is studied through different algorithms for both estimating the channel at pilot frequencies and interpolating the channel. Channel estimation at pilot frequencies is based on LS and LMS methods while channel interpolation is done using linear interpolation, second order interpolation, low-pass interpolation, spline cubic interpolation, and time domain interpolation. Time-domain interpolation is obtained by passing to the time domain by means of IDFT (inverse discrete Fourier transform), zero padding and going back to the frequency domain by DFT (discrete Fourier transform). In addition, channel estimation based on a block type pilot arrangement is performed by sending pilots in every sub-channel and using this estimation for a specific number of following symbols. We have also implemented a decision feedback equalizer for all sub-channels followed by periodic block-type pilots. We have compared the performances of all schemes by measuring bit error rates with 16QAM, QPSK, DQPSK and BPSK as modulation schemes, and multipath Rayleigh fading and AR based fading channels as channel models.","1557-9611","","10.1109/TBC.2002.804034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1033876","","Channel estimation;OFDM;Interpolation;Frequency estimation;Discrete Fourier transforms;Least squares approximation;Spline;Time domain analysis;Frequency domain analysis;Decision feedback equalizers","Rayleigh channels;interpolation;OFDM modulation;parameter estimation;least mean squares methods;frequency-domain analysis;time-domain analysis;discrete Fourier transforms;decision feedback equalisers;quadrature amplitude modulation;differential phase shift keying;quadrature phase shift keying;multipath channels;radio links","channel estimation;pilot frequencies;OFDM;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;LS methods;LMS methods;channel interpolation;inverse discrete Fourier transform;DFT;time domain;zero padding;frequency domain;decision feedback equalizer;QAM;QPSK;DQPSK;BPSK;multipath channels;Rayleigh fading channels;pilot tones","","877","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A vibrating piezoelectric device differs from a typical electrical power source in that it has a capacitive rather than inductive source impedance, and may be driven by mechanical vibrations of varying amplitude. An analytical expression for the optimal power flow from a rectified piezoelectric device is derived, and an ""energy harvesting"" circuit is proposed which can achieve this optimal power flow. The harvesting circuit consists of an AC-DC rectifier with an output capacitor, an electrochemical battery, and a switch-mode DC-DC converter that controls the energy flow into the battery. An adaptive control technique for the DC-DC converter is used to continuously implement the optimal power transfer theory and maximize the power stored by the battery. Experimental results reveal that use of the adaptive DC-DC converter increases power transfer by over 400% as compared to when the DC-DC converter is not used.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2002.802194","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1035141","","Power supplies;DC-DC power converters;Batteries;Piezoelectric devices;Load flow;Impedance;Vibrations;Rectifiers;Switched capacitor circuits;Switching circuits","power supplies to apparatus;piezoelectric devices;electric impedance;load flow;AC-DC power convertors;rectifying circuits;DC-DC power convertors;power transmission;adaptive control","adaptive piezoelectric energy harvesting circuit;wireless remote power supply;DC-DC converter;mechanically excited piezoelectric element;vibrating piezoelectric device;electrical power source;capacitive source impedance;mechanical vibrations;varying amplitude;optimal power flow;AC-DC rectifier;output capacitor;electrochemical battery;energy flow control;optimal power transfer theory","","757","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Performance-effective and low-complexity task scheduling for heterogeneous computing","H. Topcuoglu; S. Hariri; Min-You Wu","Comput. Eng. Dept., Marmara Univ., Istanbul, Turkey; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","","2002","13","3","260","274","Efficient application scheduling is critical for achieving high performance in heterogeneous computing environments. The application scheduling problem has been shown to be NP-complete in general cases as well as in several restricted cases. Because of its key importance, this problem has been extensively studied and various algorithms have been proposed in the literature which are mainly for systems with homogeneous processors. Although there are a few algorithms in the literature for heterogeneous processors, they usually require significantly high scheduling costs and they may not deliver good quality schedules with lower costs. In this paper, we present two novel scheduling algorithms for a bounded number of heterogeneous processors with an objective to simultaneously meet high performance and fast scheduling time, which are called the Heterogeneous Earliest-Finish-Time (HEFT) algorithm and the Critical-Path-on-a-Processor (CPOP) algorithm. The HEFT algorithm selects the task with the highest upward rank value at each step and assigns the selected task to the processor, which minimizes its earliest finish time with an insertion-based approach. On the other hand, the CPOP algorithm uses the summation of upward and downward rank values for prioritizing tasks. Another difference is in the processor selection phase, which schedules the critical tasks onto the processor that minimizes the total execution time of the critical tasks. In order to provide a robust and unbiased comparison with the related work, a parametric graph generator was designed to generate weighted directed acyclic graphs with various characteristics. The comparison study, based on both randomly generated graphs and the graphs of some real applications, shows that our scheduling algorithms significantly surpass previous approaches in terms of both quality and cost of schedules, which are mainly presented with schedule length ratio, speedup, frequency of best results, and average scheduling time metrics.","1558-2183","","10.1109/71.993206","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=993206","","Processor scheduling","workstation clusters;processor scheduling;directed graphs","heterogeneous computing environments;application scheduling problem;scheduling costs;Heterogeneous Earliest-Finish-Time algorithm;Critical-Path-on-a-Processor algorithm;parametric graph generator;weighted directed acyclic graphs;time metrics;list scheduling;task graphs;DAG scheduling","","1510","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Inst., Univ. of Southern California, CA, USA; NA","Proceedings.Twenty-First Annual Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies","","2002","3","","1567","1576 vol.3","This paper proposes S-MAC, a medium-access control (MAC) protocol designed for wireless sensor networks. Wireless sensor networks use battery-operated computing and sensing devices. A network of these devices will collaborate for a common application such as environmental monitoring. We expect sensor networks to be deployed in an ad hoc fashion, with individual nodes remaining largely inactive for long periods of time, but then becoming suddenly active when something is detected. These characteristics of sensor networks and applications motivate a MAC that is different from traditional wireless MACs such as IEEE 802.11 in almost every way: energy conservation and self-configuration are primary goals, while per-node fairness and latency are less important. S-MAC uses three novel techniques to reduce energy consumption and support self-configuration. To reduce energy consumption in listening to an idle channel, nodes periodically sleep. Neighboring nodes form virtual clusters to auto-synchronize on sleep schedules. Inspired by PAMAS, S-MAC also sets the radio to sleep during transmissions of other nodes. Unlike PAMAS, it only uses in-channel signaling. Finally, S-MAC applies message passing to reduce contention latency for sensor-network applications that require store-and-forward processing as data move through the network. We evaluate our implementation of S-MAC over a sample sensor node, the Mote, developed at University of California, Berkeley. The experiment results show that, on a source node, an 802.11-like MAC consumes 2-6 times more energy than S-MAC for traffic load with messages sent every 1-10 s.","0743-166X","0-7803-7476-2","10.1109/INFCOM.2002.1019408","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019408","","Energy efficiency;Media Access Protocol;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks;Sleep;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Delay;Energy consumption;Computer networks;Collaboration","access protocols;sensors;packet radio networks;wireless LAN","energy-efficient MAC protocol;wireless sensor networks;medium-access control protocol;battery-operated computing devices;battery-operated sensing devices;environmental monitoring;network nodes;wireless MAC;IEEE 802.11;energy conservation;self-configuration;per-node fairness;energy consumption reduction;idle channel;virtual clusters;sleep schedules;PAMAS;S-MAC;in-channel signaling;message passing;contention latency reduction;store-and-forward processing;sensor node;Mote;University of California;Berkeley;traffic load;wireless LAN","","1298","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, many reported methods assume that the faces in an image or an image sequence have been identified and localized. To build fully automated systems that analyze the information contained in face images, robust and efficient face detection algorithms are required. Given a single image, the goal of face detection is to identify all image regions which contain a face, regardless of its 3D position, orientation and lighting conditions. Such a problem is challenging because faces are non-rigid and have a high degree of variability in size, shape, color and texture. Numerous techniques have been developed to detect faces in a single image, and the purpose of this paper is to categorize and evaluate these algorithms. We also discuss relevant issues such as data collection, evaluation metrics and benchmarking. After analyzing these algorithms and identifying their limitations, we conclude with several promising directions for future research.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.982883","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=982883","","Face detection;Face recognition;Human computer interaction;Facial features;Algorithm design and analysis;Shape;Machine learning algorithms;Pattern recognition;Computer vision;Nose","face recognition;object detection;reviews;computer vision;feature extraction","face detection algorithms;face images;survey;intelligent vision-based human-computer interaction;face recognition;face tracking;pose estimation;expression recognition;image sequence;fully automated systems;3D position;face orientation;lighting conditions;face size;face shape;face color;face texture;data collection;evaluation metrics;benchmarking;object recognition;view-based recognition;statistical pattern recognition;machine learning","","1952","","181","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A musical genre is characterized by the common characteristics shared by its members. These characteristics typically are related to the instrumentation, rhythmic structure, and harmonic content of the music. Genre hierarchies are commonly used to structure the large collections of music available on the Web. Currently musical genre annotation is performed manually. Automatic musical genre classification can assist or replace the human user in this process and would be a valuable addition to music information retrieval systems. In addition, automatic musical genre classification provides a framework for developing and evaluating features for any type of content-based analysis of musical signals. In this paper, the automatic classification of audio signals into an hierarchy of musical genres is explored. More specifically, three feature sets for representing timbral texture, rhythmic content and pitch content are proposed. The performance and relative importance of the proposed features is investigated by training statistical pattern recognition classifiers using real-world audio collections. Both whole file and real-time frame-based classification schemes are described. Using the proposed feature sets, classification of 61% for ten musical genres is achieved. This result is comparable to results reported for human musical genre classification.","1558-2353","","10.1109/TSA.2002.800560","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1021072","","Humans;Music information retrieval;Instruments;Computer science;Multiple signal classification;Signal analysis;Pattern recognition;Feature extraction;Wavelet analysis;Cultural differences","audio signal processing;music;signal classification;statistical analysis;pattern recognition;feature extraction;information retrieval","audio signals;instrumentation;rhythmic structure;harmonic content;genre hierarchies;World Wide Web;musical genre annotation;automatic musical genre classification;music information retrieval systems;content-based analysis;musical signals;feature sets;timbral texture;rhythmic content;pitch content;statistical pattern recognition classifiers training;real-time frame-based classification;whole file classification;human musical genre classification","","1066","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It consists of a class of motion models and a general nonlinear measurement equation in position. A general algorithm is presented, which is parsimonious with the particle dimension. It is based on marginalization, enabling a Kalman filter to estimate all position derivatives, and the particle filter becomes low dimensional. This is of utmost importance for high-performance real-time applications. Automotive and airborne applications illustrate numerically the advantage over classical Kalman filter-based algorithms. Here, the use of nonlinear models and non-Gaussian noise is the main explanation for the improvement in accuracy. More specifically, we describe how the technique of map matching is used to match an aircraft's elevation profile to a digital elevation map and a car's horizontal driven path to a street map. In both cases, real-time implementations are available, and tests have shown that the accuracy in both cases is comparable with satellite navigation (as GPS) but with higher integrity. Based on simulations, we also argue how the particle filter can be used for positioning based on cellular phone measurements, for integrated navigation in aircraft, and for target tracking in aircraft and cars. Finally, the particle filter enables a promising solution to the combined task of navigation and tracking, with possible application to airborne hunting and collision avoidance systems in cars.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.978396","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=978396","","Particle filters;Particle tracking;Aircraft navigation;Position measurement;Satellite navigation systems;Target tracking;Motion measurement;Nonlinear equations;Automotive engineering;Kalman filters","Kalman filters;tracking filters;aircraft navigation;Global Positioning System;Monte Carlo methods;cellular radio;collision avoidance;automobiles;air traffic control;target tracking","particle filters;positioning;air traffic control;sequential Monte Carlo methods;motion models;nonlinear measurement equation;particle dimension;marginalization;Kalman filter;position estimation;high-performance real-time applications;airborne applications;automotive applications;digital elevation map;street map;satellite navigation;GPS;simulations;cellular phone measurements;integrated navigation;aircraft;target tracking;collision avoidance systems;airborne hunting systems","","977","","44","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A system on chip (SoC) can provide an integrated solution to challenging design problems in the telecommunications, multimedia, and consumer electronics domains. Much of the progress in these fields hinges on the designers' ability to conceive complex electronic engines under strong time-to-market pressure. Success will require using appropriate design and process technologies, as well as interconnecting existing components reliably in a plug-and-play fashion. Focusing on using probabilistic metrics such as average values or variance to quantify design objectives such as performance and power will lead to a major change in SoC design methodologies. Overall, these designs will be based on both deterministic and stochastic models. Creating complex SoCs requires a modular, component-based approach to both hardware and software design. Despite numerous challenges, the authors believe that developers will solve the problems of designing SoC networks. At the same time, they believe that a layered micronetwork design methodology will likely be the only path to mastering the complexity of future SoC designs.","1558-0814","","10.1109/2.976921","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=976921","","Network-on-a-chip;System-on-a-chip;Design methodology;Telecommunication network reliability;Multimedia systems;Consumer electronics;Fasteners;Engines;Time to market;Process design","microprocessor chips;multiprocessor interconnection networks;reconfigurable architectures;hardware-software codesign","SoC paradigm;networks on chips;system on chip;on-chip micronetworks;layered methodology;interacting system-on-chip components;integrated solution;complex electronic engines;time-to-market pressure;process technologies;interconnecting components;plug-and-play fashion;probabilistic metrics;average values;design objectives;SoC design methodologies;deterministic models;stochastic models;complex SoCs;modular component-based approach;hardware design;software design;layered micronetwork design methodology;future SoC designs","","2376","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Excellent short-channel performance is observed in devices with a wide range of gate lengths (10/spl sim/105 nm).

It is a consequence of collecting data in greater and greater quantities and the desire to extract more detailed information about the material composition of surfaces. Linear mixing is the key assumption that has permitted well-known algorithms to be adapted to the unmixing problem. In fact, the resemblance of the linear mixing model to system models in other areas has permitted a significant legacy of algorithms from a wide range of applications to be adapted to unmixing. However, it is still unclear whether the assumption of linearity is sufficient to model the mixing process in every application of interest. It is clear, however, that the applicability of models and techniques is highly dependent on the variety of circumstances and factors that give rise to mixed pixels.

To prevent these failures and to maintain transformers in good operating condition is a very important issue for utilities. Traditionally, routine preventative maintenance programs combined with regular testing were used. The change to condition-based maintenance has resulted in the reduction, or even elimination, of routine time-based maintenance. Instead of doing maintenance at a regular interval, maintenance is only carried out if the condition of the equipment requires it. Hence, there is an increasing need for better nonintrusive diagnostic and monitoring tools to assess the internal condition of the transformers. If there is a problem, the transformer can then be repaired or replaced before it fails. An extensive review is given of diagnostic and monitoring tests, and equipment available that assess the condition of power transformers and provide an early warning of potential failure.","1558-4402","","10.1109/MEI.2002.1161455","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1161455","","Power transformers;Power transformer insulation;Oil insulation;Maintenance;Condition monitoring;Costs;Petroleum;Partial discharges;Power system interconnection;Power system reliability","power transformer testing;condition monitoring;power transformer insulation;insulation testing;transformer oil;chemical analysis;partial discharge measurement;infrared imaging;power factor measurement;voltage measurement;transformer windings;frequency measurement;electric resistance measurement","condition assessment;in-service power transformers;condition-based maintenance;monitoring tests;diagnostic tests;potential failure warning;nonintrusive diagnostic tools;nonintrusive monitoring tools;transformer internal condition;transformer life management;dissolved gas analysis;insulating oil quality;power factor testing;thermography;in-service PD testing;recovery voltage measurement;winding insulating oil testing/monitoring;tap changer monitoring;internal temperature measurement;on-line power factor measurement;frequency measurement;diagnostic software;expert systems;dielectric spectroscopy;winding movement detection;winding turns ratio test;winding resistance","","477","","107","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The adjective ""unsupervised"" is justified by two properties of the algorithm: 1) it is capable of selecting the number of components and 2) unlike the standard expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, it does not require careful initialization. The proposed method also avoids another drawback of EM for mixture fitting: the possibility of convergence toward a singular estimate at the boundary of the parameter space. The novelty of our approach is that we do not use a model selection criterion to choose one among a set of preestimated candidate models; instead, we seamlessly integrate estimation and model selection in a single algorithm. Our technique can be applied to any type of parametric mixture model for which it is possible to write an EM algorithm; in this paper, we illustrate it with experiments involving Gaussian mixtures.

However, the exact and general BER expression of QAM with an arbitrary constellation size has not been derived yet. We provide an exact and general closed-form expression of the BER for one-dimensional and two-dimensional amplitude modulations, i.e., PAM and QAM, under an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel when Gray code bit mapping is employed. The provided BER expressions offer a convenient way to evaluate the performance of PAM and QAM systems for various cases of practical interest.

Our approach is to first design the controller using established techniques and considering the network transparency, and then analyze the effect of the network on closed-loop system performance. When implemented, an NCS consists of multiple independent sensors and actuators competing for an access to the network, with no universal clock available to synchronize their actions. Since the nodes act asynchronously, we allow access to the network at anytime, but assume each access occurs before a prescribed deadline, known as the maximum allowable transfer interval. Only one node may access the network at a time. This communication constraint imposed by the network is the main focus of the paper.

Finite-difference time-domain simulation is used for optimization of the antenna and the results agree very well with measurements. Additionally, a gain-enhanced design is presented, where higher gain has been achieved at the cost of reduced bandwidth. These quasi-Yagi antennas are realized on a high dielectric constant substrate and are completely compatible with microstrip circuitry and solid-state devices.

Even if nonstandard devices such as depletion-mode MOS transistors may be helpful to manage the supply scaling, they are seldom available and poorly characterized. Therefore, they must be avoided in a robust design featuring a high portability.

In that sense, QRS detection provides the fundamentals for almost all automated ECG analysis algorithms. Software QRS detection has been a research topic for more than 30 years. The evolution of these algorithms clearly reflects the great advances in computer technology.

This geometry, which has been used to model complex objects found in nature such as clouds and coastlines, has space-filling properties that can be utilized to miniaturize antennas. These contours are able to add more electrical length in less volume. In this article, we look at miniaturizing wire and patch antennas using fractals. Fractals are profoundly intricate shapes that are easy to define. It is seen that even though the mathematical foundations call for an infinitely complex structure, the complexity that is not discernible for the particular application can be truncated. For antennas, this means that we can reap the rewards of miniaturizing an antenna using fractals without paying the price of having to manufacture an infinitely complex radiator. In fact, it is shown that the required number of generating iterations, each of which adds a layer of intricacy, is only a few. A primer on the mathematical bases of fractal geometry is also given, focusing especially on the mathematical properties that apply to the analysis of antennas. Also presented is an application of these miniaturized antennas to phased arrays. It is shown how these fractal antennas can be used in tightly packed linear arrays, resulting in phased arrays that can scan to wider angles while avoiding grating lobes.","1558-4143","","10.1109/74.997888","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=997888","","Fractal antennas;Phased arrays;Linear antenna arrays;Geometry;Solid modeling;Clouds;Wire;Patch antennas;Shape;Manufacturing","fractals;antenna phased arrays;linear antenna arrays;wire antennas;microstrip antenna arrays;antenna theory;loop antennas;antenna radiation patterns","fractal antennas;antenna miniaturization technique;recursive generating methodology;space-filling properties;wire antennas;patch antennas;generating iterations;phased arrays;tightly packed linear arrays","","416","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Typically these methods find a set of basis images and represent faces as a linear combination of those images. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular example of such methods. The basis images found by PCA depend only on pairwise relationships between pixels in the image database. In a task such as face recognition, in which important information may be contained in the high-order relationships among pixels, it seems reasonable to expect that better basis images may be found by methods sensitive to these high-order statistics. Independent component analysis (ICA), a generalization of PCA, is one such method. We used a version of ICA derived from the principle of optimal information transfer through sigmoidal neurons. ICA was performed on face images in the FERET database under two different architectures, one which treated the images as random variables and the pixels as outcomes, and a second which treated the pixels as random variables and the images as outcomes. The first architecture found spatially local basis images for the faces. The second architecture produced a factorial face code. Both ICA representations were superior to representations based on PCA for recognizing faces across days and changes in expression. A classifier that combined the two ICA representations gave the best performance.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2002.804287","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1058079","","Face recognition;Independent component analysis;Principal component analysis;Pixel;Image databases;Random variables;Statistical analysis;Statistics;Neurons;Spatial databases","independent component analysis;face recognition;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;unsupervised learning","face recognition;independent component analysis;face representations;unsupervised statistical methods;principal component analysis;FERET database;factorial face code;eigenfaces;unsupervised learning","","1221","","61","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our implementations offer exact reconstruction, stability against perturbations, ease of implementation, and low computational complexity. A central tool is Fourier-domain computation of an approximate digital Radon transform. We introduce a very simple interpolation in the Fourier space which takes Cartesian samples and yields samples on a rectopolar grid, which is a pseudo-polar sampling set based on a concentric squares geometry. Despite the crudeness of our interpolation, the visual performance is surprisingly good. Our ridgelet transform applies to the Radon transform a special overcomplete wavelet pyramid whose wavelets have compact support in the frequency domain. Our curvelet transform uses our ridgelet transform as a component step, and implements curvelet subbands using a filter bank of a/spl grave/ trous wavelet filters. Our philosophy throughout is that transforms should be overcomplete, rather than critically sampled. We apply these digital transforms to the denoising of some standard images embedded in white noise. In the tests reported here, simple thresholding of the curvelet coefficients is very competitive with ""state of the art"" techniques based on wavelets, including thresholding of decimated or undecimated wavelet transforms and also including tree-based Bayesian posterior mean methods. Moreover, the curvelet reconstructions exhibit higher perceptual quality than wavelet-based reconstructions, offering visually sharper images and, in particular, higher quality recovery of edges and of faint linear and curvilinear features. Existing theory for curvelet and ridgelet transforms suggests that these new approaches can outperform wavelet methods in certain image reconstruction problems. The empirical results reported here are in encouraging agreement.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2002.1014998","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1014998","","Image denoising;Wavelet transforms;Image reconstruction;Interpolation;Wavelet domain;Filter bank;Stability;Computational complexity;Fourier transforms;Sampling methods","Fourier transforms;wavelet transforms;image reconstruction;white noise;channel bank filters;filtering theory;Radon transforms;interpolation","curvelet transform;image denoising;approximate digital implementations;ridgelet transform;exact reconstruction;stability;low computational complexity;Fourier-domain;approximate digital Radon transform;interpolation;Fourier space;Cartesian samples;rectopolar grid;pseudo-polar sampling set;concentric squares geometry;visual performance;overcomplete wavelet pyramid;frequency domain;filter bank;trous wavelet filters;white noise;curvelet coefficients;undecimated wavelet transforms;decimated wavelet transforms;tree-based Bayesian posterior mean methods;wavelet-based image reconstruction","","1264","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Second, the paper investigates how CLARANS can handle not only point objects, but also polygon objects efficiently. One of the methods considered, called the IR-approximation, is very efficient in clustering convex and nonconvex polygon objects.

The platform, which we call Network-on-Chip (NOC), includes both the architecture and the design methodology. The NOC architecture is a m/spl times/n mesh of switches and resources are placed on the slots formed by the switches. We assume a direct layout of the 2-D mesh of switches and resources providing physical- and architectural-level design integration. Each switch is connected to one resource and four neighboring switches, and each resource is connected to one switch. A resource can be a processor core, memory, an FPGA, a custom hardware block or any other intellectual property (IP) block, which fits into the available slot and complies with the interface of the NOC. The NOC architecture essentially is the onchip communication infrastructure comprising the physical layer, the data link layer and the network layer of the OSI protocol stack. We define the concept of a region, which occupies an area of any number of resources and switches. This concept allows the NOC to accommodate large resources such as large memory banks, FPGA areas, or special purpose computation resources such as high performance multi-processors. The NOC design methodology consists of two phases. In the first phase a concrete architecture is derived from the general NOC template. The concrete architecture defines the number of switches and shape of the network, the kind and shape of regions and the number and kind of resources. The second phase maps the application onto the concrete architecture to form a concrete product.","","0-7695-1486-3","10.1109/ISVLSI.2002.1016885","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1016885","","Network-on-a-chip;Design methodology;Switches;Concrete;Communication switching;Field programmable gate arrays;Computer architecture;Shape;Packet switching;Hardware","application specific integrated circuits;integrated circuit design;multiprocessor interconnection networks;parallel architectures;resource allocation","network on chip architecture;design methodology;packet switched platform;single chip systems;processor like resources;direct 2-D mesh switch layout;architectural level design integration;processor core;memory;FPGA;custom hardware block;intellectual property block;physical layer;data link layer;network layer;OSI protocol stack;high performance multi-processors;mesh interconnection topology","","578","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We describe several communication techniques to mitigate turbulence-induced intensity fluctuations, i.e., signal fading. These techniques are applicable in the regime in which the receiver aperture is smaller than the correlation length of fading and the observation interval is shorter than the correlation time of fading. We assume that the receiver has no knowledge of the instantaneous fading state. When the receiver knows only the marginal statistics of the fading, a symbol-by-symbol ML detector can be used to improve detection performance. If the receiver has knowledge of the joint temporal statistics of the fading, maximum-likelihood sequence detection (MLSD) can be employed, yielding a further performance improvement, but at the cost of very high complexity. Spatial diversity reception with multiple receivers can also be used to overcome turbulence-induced fading. We describe the use of ML detection in spatial diversity reception to reduce the diversity gain penalty caused by correlation between the fading at different receivers.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2002.800829","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1025501","","Optical fiber communication;Fading;Fluctuations;Statistics;Diversity reception;Optical receivers;Apertures;Detectors;Maximum likelihood detection;Costs","optical communication;optical links;atmospheric turbulence;correlation methods;fading channels;maximum likelihood detection;diversity reception;Markov processes;optical signal detection;optical information processing","atmospheric turbulence channels;free-space optical communication links;link performance;turbulence-induced intensity fluctuations;signal fading;receiver aperture;fading correlation length;observation interval;correlation time;receiver;marginal fading statistics;symbol-by-symbol ML detector;detection performance;joint temporal statistics;maximum-likelihood sequence detection;MLSD;spatial diversity reception;turbulence-induced fading;ML detection;diversity gain;reduced-complexity implementation;single-step Markov chain model;per-survivor processing;computational complexity","","816","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, the paper discusses the factors involved in making a high-quality VoIP call and the engineering tradeoffs that must be made between delay and the efficient use of bandwidth. After a discussion of codec selection and the delay budget, there is a discussion of various techniques to achieve network quality of service. Since call setup is very important, the paper next gives an overview of several VoIP call signaling protocols, including H.323, SIP, MGCP, and Megaco/H.248.

To replace the sensor the information on the rotor speed is extracted from measured stator voltages and currents at the motor terminals. Vector-controlled drives require estimating the magnitude and spatial orientation of the fundamental magnetic flux waves in the stator or in the rotor. Open-loop estimators or closed-loop observers are used for this purpose. They differ with respect to accuracy, robustness, and sensitivity against model parameter variations. Dynamic performance and steady-state speed accuracy in the low-speed range can be achieved by exploiting parasitic effects of the machine.

The diversity benefit is exploited by tracking the channel fluctuations of the users and scheduling transmissions to users when their instantaneous channel quality is near the peak. The diversity gain increases with the dynamic range of the fluctuations and is thus limited in environments with little scattering and/or slow fading. In such environments, we propose the use of multiple transmit antennas to induce large and fast channel fluctuations so that multiuser diversity can still be exploited. The scheme can be interpreted as opportunistic beamforming and we show that true beamforming gains can be achieved when there are sufficient users, even though very limited channel feedback is needed. Furthermore, in a cellular system, the scheme plays an additional role of opportunistic nulling of the interference created on users of adjacent cells.

In the conventional low-pass topology, the quantities L and C represent a positive equivalent permeability and permittivity, respectively. However, in the dual configuration, in which the positions of L and C are simply interchanged, these equivalent material parameters assume simultaneously negative values.

The GFC method, which is robust to changes in illumination and facial expression, applies the enhanced Fisher linear discriminant model (EFM) to an augmented Gabor feature vector derived from the Gabor wavelet representation of face images. The novelty of this paper comes from (1) the derivation of an augmented Gabor feature vector, whose dimensionality is further reduced using the EFM by considering both data compression and recognition (generalization) performance; (2) the development of a Gabor-Fisher classifier for multi-class problems; and (3) extensive performance evaluation studies. In particular, we performed comparative studies of different similarity measures applied to various classifiers. We also performed comparative experimental studies of various face recognition schemes, including our novel GFC method, the Gabor wavelet method, the eigenfaces method, the Fisherfaces method, the EFM method, the combination of Gabor and the eigenfaces method, and the combination of Gabor and the Fisherfaces method. The feasibility of the new GFC method has been successfully tested on face recognition using 600 FERET frontal face images corresponding to 200 subjects, which were acquired under variable illumination and facial expressions.

The stochastic model has also been used to investigate the capacity of MIMO radio channels, considering two different power allocation strategies, water filling and uniform and two different antenna topologies, 4/spl times/4 and 2/spl times/4. Space diversity used at both ends of the MIMO radio link is shown to be an efficient technique in picocell environments, achieving capacities within 14 b/s/Hz and 16 b/s/Hz in 80% of the cases for a 4/spl times/4 antenna configuration implementing water filling at a SNR of 20 dB.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2002.801223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1021913","","Stochastic processes;MIMO;Antenna measurements;Decorrelation;Base stations;Narrowband;Filling;Receiving antennas;Electronic mail;Scattering","MIMO systems;stochastic processes;microcellular radio;picocellular radio;correlation methods;matrix algebra;channel capacity;diversity reception;radio links;antenna arrays;radiowave propagation","stochastic MIMO radio channel model;multiple-input/multiple-output channels;correlation matrices;mobile station;base station;single-input/multiple-output channels;input parameters;narrowband channels;picocell environment;microcell environment;stochastic model;channel capacity;uniform power allocation;water filling power allocation;antenna topologies;space diversity;MIMO radio link;SNR;antenna arrays","","884","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for MIMO channels (MIMO-OFDM) is considered for wideband transmission to mitigate intersymbol interference and enhance system capacity. The MIMO-OFDM system uses two independent space-time codes for two sets of two transmit antennas. At the receiver, the independent space-time codes are decoded using prewhitening, followed by minimum-Euclidean-distance decoding based on successive interference cancellation. Computer simulation shows that for four-input and four-output systems transmitting data at 4 Mb/s over a 1.25 MHz channel, the required signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for 10% and 1% word error rates (WER) are 10.5 dB and 13.8 dB, respectively, when each codeword contains 500 information bits and the channel's Doppler frequency is 40 Hz (corresponding normalized frequency: 0.9%). Increasing the number of the receive antennas improves the system performance. When the number or receive antennas is increased from four to eight, the required SNRs for 10% and 1% WER are reduced to 4 dB and 6 dB, respectively. Therefore, MIMO-OFDM is a promising technique for highly spectrally efficient wideband transmission.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2002.802566","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1033009","","Wireless communication;Signal detection;Channel estimation;Receiving antennas;MIMO;OFDM;Wideband;Space time codes;Decoding;Intersymbol interference","MIMO systems;OFDM modulation;receiving antennas;transmitting antennas;antenna arrays;signal detection;channel capacity;radio networks;broadband networks;intersymbol interference;interference suppression;decoding;parameter estimation","MIMO-OFDM for wireless communications;signal detection;channel estimation;multiple transmit antennas;multiple receive antennas;multiple-input multiple-output channels;MIMO channels;channel capacity;wideband transmission;intersymbol interference;system capacity;space-time codes;receiver;prewhitening;minimum Euclidean-distance decoding;successive interference cancellation;computer simulation;signal-to-noise ratio;SNR;system performance;codeword;word error rates;Doppler frequency;normalized frequency","","355","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Gathering sensed information in an energy efficient manner is critical to operate the sensor network for a long period of time. In W. Heinzelman et al. (Proc. Hawaii Conf. on System Sci., 2000), a data collection problem is defined where, in a round of communication, each sensor node has a packet to be sent to the distant base station. If each node transmits its sensed data directly to the base station then it will deplete its power quickly. The LEACH protocol presented by W. Heinzelman et al. is an elegant solution where clusters are formed to fuse data before transmitting to the base station. By randomizing the cluster heads chosen to transmit to the base station, LEACH achieves a factor of 8 improvement compared to direct transmissions, as measured in terms of when nodes die. In this paper, we propose PEGASIS (power-efficient gathering in sensor information systems), a near optimal chain-based protocol that is an improvement over LEACH. In PEGASIS, each node communicates only with a close neighbor and takes turns transmitting to the base station, thus reducing the amount of energy spent per round. Simulation results show that PEGASIS performs better than LEACH by about 100 to 300% when 1%, 20%, 50%, and 100% of nodes die for different network sizes and topologies.","","0-7803-7231-X","10.1109/AERO.2002.1035242","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1035242","","Sensor systems;Information systems;Base stations;Batteries;Wireless communication;Protocols;Costs;Network topology;Collaboration;Sensor fusion","distributed sensors;packet radio networks;sensor fusion;routing protocols","sensor system power-efficient information gathering;PEGASIS;sensor web nodes;wireless communication sensors;limited battery power sensors;energy efficient information gathering;sensor networks;data collection;packet transmission;base stations;LEACH protocol;data fusion clusters;cluster head randomization;optimal chain-based protocols;node neighbor communication;node death","","1369","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, detection of exudates is an important diagnostic task, in which computer assistance may play a major role. Exudates are found using their high grey level variation, and their contours are determined by means of morphological reconstruction techniques. The detection of the optic disc is indispensable for this approach. We detect the optic disc by means of morphological filtering techniques and the watershed transformation. The algorithm has been tested on a small image data base and compared with the performance of a human grader. As a result, we obtain a mean sensitivity of 92.8% and a mean predictive value of 92.4%.

MRI intensity inhomogeneities can be attributed to imperfections in the radio-frequency coils or to problems associated with the acquisition sequences. The result is a slowly varying shading artifact over the image that can produce errors with conventional intensity-based classification. Our algorithm is formulated by modifying the objective function of the standard fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm to compensate for such inhomogeneities and to allow the labeling of a pixel (voxel) to be influenced by the labels in its immediate neighborhood. The neighborhood effect acts as a regularizer and biases the solution toward piecewise-homogeneous labelings. Such a regularization is useful in segmenting scans corrupted by salt and pepper noise. Experimental results on both synthetic images and MR data are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.996338","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=996338","","Magnetic resonance imaging;Image segmentation;Fuzzy logic;Imaging phantoms;Coils;Labeling;Nonuniform electric fields;Polynomials;Radio frequency;Classification algorithms","biomedical MRI;medical image processing;image segmentation;fuzzy logic;image sequences;image classification;brain;adaptive signal processing","modified fuzzy c-means algorithm;bias field estimation;MRI data segmentation;magnetic resonance imaging;intensity inhomogeneities;fuzzy logic;MRI intensity inhomogeneities;radio-frequency coil imperfections;acquisition sequences;slowly varying shading artifact;errors;intensity-based classification;algorithm;standard fuzzy c-means algorithm;labeling;regularizer;piecewise-homogeneous labelings;regularization;salt and pepper noise;synthetic images;efficiency;real brain MR images","Algorithms;Brain;Brain Neoplasms;Cluster Analysis;Fuzzy Logic;Humans;Image Enhancement;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Phantoms, Imaging;Sensitivity and Specificity;Stochastic Processes","1060","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Current approaches represent two extremes: idealized statistical models representing a rich scattering environment and parameterized physical models that describe realistic scattering environments via the angles and gains associated with different propagation paths. However, simple rules that capture the effects of scattering characteristics on channel capacity and diversity are difficult to infer from existing models. We propose an intermediate virtual channel representation that captures the essence of physical modeling and provides a simple geometric interpretation of the scattering environment. The virtual representation corresponds to a fixed coordinate transformation via spatial basis functions defined by fixed virtual angles. We show that in an uncorrelated scattering environment, the elements of the channel matrix form a segment of a stationary process and that the virtual channel coefficients are approximately uncorrelated samples of the underlying spectral representation. For any scattering environment, the virtual channel matrix clearly reveals the two key factors affecting capacity: the number of parallel channels and the level of diversity. The concepts of spatial zooming and aliasing are introduced to provide a transparent interpretation of the effect of antenna spacing on channel statistics and capacity. Numerical results are presented to illustrate various aspects of the virtual framework.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2002.803324","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1033686","","Fading;Channel capacity;Statistics;MIMO;Antennas and propagation;Antenna arrays;Wireless communication;Scattering parameters;Solid modeling;Receiving antennas","electromagnetic wave scattering;linear antenna arrays;multipath channels;radiowave propagation;fading channels;channel capacity;statistical analysis","multiantenna fading channels deconstruction;channel modeling;antenna arrays;wireless communications;idealized statistical models;parameterized physical models;uniform linear antenna arrays;multipath channel;scattering environments;propagation paths;scattering characteristics;channel capacity;diversity;virtual channel representation;physical modeling;geometric interpretation;fixed coordinate transformation;spatial basis functions;fixed virtual angles;uncorrelated scattering environment;channel matrix elements;stationary process;virtual channel coefficients;uncorrelated samples;spectral representation;virtual channel matrix;parallel channels;spatial zooming;aliasing;antenna spacing;channel statistics","","573","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We derive a sequence of analytical results which show that the reconstruction constraints provide less and less useful information as the magnification factor increases. We also validate these results empirically and show that, for large enough magnification factors, any smoothness prior leads to overly smooth results with very little high-frequency content. Next, we propose a super-resolution algorithm that uses a different kind of constraint in addition to the reconstruction constraints. The algorithm attempts to recognize local features in the low-resolution images and then enhances their resolution in an appropriate manner.

The main purpose of a sensor network is to monitor an area, including detecting, identifying, localizing, and tracking one or more objects of interest. These networks may be used by the military in surveillance, reconnaissance, and combat scenarios or around the perimeter of a manufacturing plant for intrusion detection. In other applications such as hearing aids and multimedia, microphone networks are capable of enhancing audio signals under noisy conditions for improved intelligibility, recognition, and cuing for camera aiming. Previous developments in integrated circuit technology have allowed the construction of low-cost miniature sensor nodes with signal processing and wireless communication capabilities. These technological advances not only open up many possibilities but also introduce challenging issues for the collaborative processing of wideband acoustic and seismic signals for source localization and beamforming in an energy-constrained distributed sensor network.

Analytical solution of 3-D Laplace's equation is employed to establish the design equations for the subthreshold behavior in the fully depleted silicon fins. Based on the 3-D analytical electrostatic potential in the subthreshold region, the threshold voltage (V/sub th/) roll-off and the subthreshold swing (S) are estimated by considering the source barrier changes in the most leaky channel path. V/sub th/ roll-off is an exponential function of the ratio of effective channel length to drain potential decay length, which can then be expressed as a function of the fin thickness, the fin height and the gate oxide thickness. The drain-potential decay lengths of single-gate fully depleted SOI MOSFET (FDFET), double-gate MOSFET (DGFET), rectangular surrounding-gate MOSFET (SGFET), and FinFET are compared.

"A genetic algorithm for shortest path routing problem and the sizing of populations","Chang Wook Ahn; R. S.

Variable-length chromosomes (strings) and their genes (parameters) have been used for encoding the problem. The crossover operation exchanges partial chromosomes (partial routes) at positionally independent crossing sites and the mutation operation maintains the genetic diversity of the population. The proposed algorithm can cure all the infeasible chromosomes with a simple repair function. Crossover and mutation together provide a search capability that results in improved quality of solution and enhanced rate of convergence. This paper also develops a population-sizing equation that facilitates a solution with desired quality. It is based on the gambler ruin model; the equation has been further enhanced and generalized. The equation relates the size of the population, quality of solution, cardinality of the alphabet, and other parameters of the proposed algorithm. Computer simulations show that the proposed algorithm exhibits a much better quality of solution (route optimality) and a much higher rate of convergence than other algorithms. The results are relatively independent of problem types for almost all source-destination pairs. Furthermore, simulation studies emphasize the usefulness of the population-sizing equation. The equation scales to larger networks. It is felt that it can be used for determining an adequate population size in the SP routing problem.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2002.804323","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1134124","","Genetic algorithms;Routing;Equations;Biological cells;Network topology;Genetic mutations;Quality of service;Mobile communication;Mobile ad hoc networks;Delay estimation","telecommunication network routing;genetic algorithms;encoding;convergence;ad hoc networks","shortest path routing problem;encoding;crossover operation;partial chromosomes;mutation operation;convergence;population-sizing equation;gambler ruin model;genetic algorithms;mobile ad hoc networks","","349","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

SRAD is the edge-sensitive diffusion for speckled images, in the same way that conventional anisotropic diffusion is the edge-sensitive diffusion for images corrupted with additive noise. We first show that the Lee and Frost filters can be cast as partial differential equations, and then we derive SRAD by allowing edge-sensitive anisotropic diffusion within this context. Just as the Lee (1980, 1981, 1986) and Frost (1982) filters utilize the coefficient of variation in adaptive filtering, SRAD exploits the instantaneous coefficient of variation, which is shown to be a function of the local gradient magnitude and Laplacian operators. We validate the new algorithm using both synthetic and real linear scan ultrasonic imagery of the carotid artery. We also demonstrate the algorithm performance with real SAR data. The performance measures obtained by means of computer simulation of carotid artery images are compared with three existing speckle reduction schemes. In the presence of speckle noise, speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion excels over the traditional speckle removal filters and over the conventional anisotropic diffusion method in terms of mean preservation, variance reduction, and edge localization.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2002.804276","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1097762","","Speckle;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Adaptive filters;Carotid arteries;Radar imaging;Additive noise;Partial differential equations;Laplace equations;Ultrasonic variables measurement;Computer simulation","speckle;biomedical ultrasonics;ultrasonic imaging;synthetic aperture radar;radar imaging;medical image processing;adaptive filters;filtering theory;adaptive signal processing;cardiology;nonlinear differential equations","speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion;ultrasonic imaging;radar imaging;speckled images;additive noise;nonlinear partial differential equations;nonlinear PDE;medical ultrasound image interpretation;edge-sensitive anisotropic diffusion;coefficient of variation;adaptive filtering;instantaneous coefficient of variation;local gradient magnitude;Laplacian operators;synthetic linear scan ultrasonic imagery;real linear scan ultrasonic imagery;carotid artery;real SAR data;performance measures;computer simulation;speckle noise;speckle removal filters;mean preservation;variance reduction;edge localization;Lee filter;Frost filter","","823","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The LC filter is used to limit the rate of rise of the inverter output voltage and reduce common mode noise to the motor. In typical applications where dv/dt is limited to 100-500 V//spl mu/s, the resonant frequency of the filter is above the switching frequency. A diode bridge must therefore be used to clamp the resonant voltage. Resistors are also used to help dissipate the energy stored in the resonant circuit. Crucial to the design of the filter is the handling of the additional losses in the filter. The paper describes the design considerations for such a filter for use in a 460 V induction motor drive. The losses in the circuit are estimated to show the limitations of the filter.

Military applications required wide-band and tunable devices for electronic support measures receivers, which led to the development of highly selective wide-band waveguide filters, coaxial resonator and suspended-substrate multiplexers, and electronically tunable filters. The satellite communications industry created demand for low-mass narrow-band low-loss filters with severe specifications on amplitude selectivity and phase linearity. These requirements resulted in the development of dual-mode waveguide and dielectric-resonator filters, and advances in the design of contiguous multiplexers. Cellular communications base-stations demanded low-loss high power-handling selective filters with small physical size, capable of being manufactured in tens of thousands at a reasonable cost. These demands led to advances in coaxial resonator, dielectric resonator, and superconducting filters, and also to methods of cost-reduction, including computer-aided alignment. Cellular radio handsets have required the manufacture of hundreds of millions of extremely small very low-cost filters, still with reasonably low loss and high selectivity.

Higher level understanding of events requires that certain lower level computer vision tasks be performed. These may include detection of unusual motion, tracking targets, labeling body parts, and understanding the interactions between people. To achieve many of these tasks, it is necessary to build representations of the appearance of objects in the scene. This paper focuses on two issues related to this problem. First, we construct a statistical representation of the scene background that supports sensitive detection of moving objects in the scene, but is robust to clutter arising out of natural scene variations. Second, we build statistical representations of the foreground regions (moving objects) that support their tracking and support occlusion reasoning. The probability density functions (pdfs) associated with the background and foreground are likely to vary from image to image and will not in general have a known parametric form. We accordingly utilize general nonparametric kernel density estimation techniques for building these statistical representations of the background and the foreground. These techniques estimate the pdf directly from the data without any assumptions about the underlying distributions. Example results from applications are presented.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2002.801448","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1032799","","Kernel;Surveillance;Layout;Computer vision;Motion detection;Target tracking;Labeling;Object detection;Robustness;Probability density function","computer vision;surveillance;image representation;parameter estimation;nonparametric statistics","automatic understanding;computer vision;visual surveillance;scene background;statistical representation;probability density functions;kernel density estimation;occlusion modeling;nonparametric","","964","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Multipath components were resolved in time by using a sliding correlator with 10-ns resolution and in space by sweeping a directional antenna with 7/spl deg/ half power beamwidth in the azimuthal direction. Power delay profiles (PDPs) and power angle profiles (PAPs) were measured in various indoor and short-range outdoor environments. Detailed multipath structure was retrieved from PDPs and PAPs and was related to site-specific environments. Results show an excellent correlation between the propagation environments and the multipath channel structures. The measurement results confirm that the majority of the multipath components can be determined from image based ray tracing techniques for line-of-sight (LOS) applications.

From the recorded PDPs and PAPs, received signal power and statistical parameters of angle-of-arrival and time-of-arrival were also calculated. These parameters accurately describe the spatial and temporal properties of millimeter-wave channels and can be used as empirical values for broadband wireless system design for 60-GHz short-range channels.","1558-0008","","10.1109/49.995521","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=995521","","Antenna measurements;Spatial resolution;Correlators;Directional antennas;Delay;Power measurement;Multipath channels;Ray tracing;Millimeter wave propagation;Millimeter wave technology","indoor radio;millimetre wave propagation;multipath channels;ray tracing;direction-of-arrival estimation;broadband networks","spatial characteristics;temporal characteristics;indoor channels;multipath components;directional antenna;power delay profiles;power angle profiles;PDPs;PAPs;propagation environments;image based ray tracing techniques;line-of-sight applications;nonLOS propagation;NLOS propagation;metallic structure;composite walls;received signal power;statistical parameters;angle-of-arrival;time-of-arrival;millimeter-wave channels;broadband wireless system design;60 GHz","","392","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Examples of signals with a finite rate of innovation include streams of Diracs (e.g., the Poisson process), nonuniform splines, and piecewise polynomials. Even though these signals are not bandlimited, we show that they can be sampled uniformly at (or above) the rate of innovation using an appropriate kernel and then be perfectly reconstructed. Thus, we prove sampling theorems for classes of signals and kernels that generalize the classic ""bandlimited and sinc kernel"" case. In particular, we show how to sample and reconstruct periodic and finite-length streams of Diracs, nonuniform splines, and piecewise polynomials using sinc and Gaussian kernels. For infinite-length signals with finite local rate of innovation, we show local sampling and reconstruction based on spline kernels. The key in all constructions is to identify the innovative part of a signal (e.g., time instants and weights of Diracs) using an annihilating or locator filter: a device well known in spectral analysis and error-correction coding. This leads to standard computational procedures for solving the sampling problem, which we show through experimental results. Applications of these new sampling results can be found in signal processing, communications systems, and biological systems.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2002.1003065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1003065","","Sampling methods;Technological innovation;Kernel;Signal sampling;Signal processing;Polynomials;Filters;Spectral analysis;Biology computing;Biomedical signal processing","signal sampling;signal reconstruction;bandlimited signals;splines (mathematics);polynomials;filtering theory;spectral analysis;error correction codes","signal sampling;finite innovation rate;Dirac streams;nonuniform splines;Poisson process;piecewise polynomials;signal reconstruction;sampling theorems;bandlimited kernel;sinc kernel;bandlimited signal;periodic streams;finite-length streams;local sampling;local reconstruction;spline kernels;annihilating filter;locator filter;spectral analysis;error-correction coding;signal processing;communications systems;biological systems","","630","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One important component of radio resource management is power control, which has been studied extensively in the context of voice communications. With the increasing demand for wireless data services, it is necessary to establish power control algorithms for information sources other than voice. We present a power control solution for wireless data in the analytical setting of a game theoretic framework. In this context, the quality of service (QoS) a wireless terminal receives is referred to as the utility and distributed power control is a noncooperative power control game where users maximize their utility. The outcome of the game results in a Nash (1951) equilibrium that is inefficient. We introduce pricing of transmit powers in order to obtain Pareto improvement of the noncooperative power control game, i.e., to obtain improvements in user utilities relative to the case with no pricing. Specifically, we consider a pricing function that is a linear function of the transmit power. The simplicity of the pricing function allows a distributed implementation where the price can be broadcast by the base station to all the terminals. We see that pricing is especially helpful in a heavily loaded system.","1558-0857","","10.1109/26.983324","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=983324","","Power control;Pricing;Context;Quality of service;Wireless communication;Resource management;Data analysis;Game theory;Context-aware services;Broadcasting","radio networks;data communication;telecommunication control;power control;costing;tariffs;quality of service;game theory;distributed control","efficient power control;wireless data networks;wireless communications systems;radio resource management;voice communications;game theory;quality of service;QoS;wireless terminal;distributed power control;noncooperative power control game;Nash equilibrium;transmit power pricing;Pareto improvement;user utilities;pricing function;distributed implementation;base station;heavily loaded system;wireless data services;power control algorithms","","997","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The emphasis is on parametric amplifiers in general and single pumped parametric amplifiers in particular. While a theoretical framework based on highly efficient four-photon mixing is provided, the focus is on the intriguing applications enabled by the parametric gain, such as all-optical signal sampling, time-demultiplexing, pulse generation, and wavelength conversion. As these amplifiers offer high gain and low noise at arbitrary wavelengths with proper fiber design and pump wavelength allocation, they are also candidate enablers to increase overall wavelength-division-multiplexing system capacities similar to the more well-known Raman amplifiers. Similarities and distinctions between Raman and parametric amplifiers are also addressed. Since the first fiber-based parametric amplifier experiments providing net continuous-wave gain in the for the optical fiber communication applications interesting 1.5-/spl mu/m region were only conducted about two years ago, there is reason to believe that substantial progress may be made in the future, perhaps involving ""holey fibers"" to further enhance the nonlinearity and thus the gain.

On the other hand, a large phased array will still function properly, albeit with a slightly decreased efficiency and higher sidelobes if 3-4% of the phase shifters fail. Currently, the failure mechanisms of MEMS switches are being investigated and will greatly benefit the reliability of MEMS phase shifters. Also, the hermetic packaging of MEMS phase shifters is not straightforward, due to their relatively large size.

IEEE","","2002","2","","646","651 vol.2","Presents a road obstacle detection method able to cope with uphill and downhill gradients and dynamic pitching of the vehicle. Our approach is based on the construction and investigation of the ""v-disparity"" image which provides a good representation of the geometric content of the road scene. The advantage of this image is that it provides semi-global matching and is able to perform robust obstacle detection even in the case of partial occlusion or errors committed during the matching process. Furthermore, this detection is performed without any explicit extraction of coherent structures. This paper explains the construction of the ""v-disparity"" image, its main properties, and the obstacle detection method.

The proposed model is more general and realistic than the usual independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) model, and allows us to investigate the behavior of channel capacity as a function of the scattering radii at transmitter and receiver, distance between the transmit and receive arrays, and antenna beamwidths and spacing. We show how the MIMO capacity is governed by spatial fading correlation and the condition number of the channel matrix through specific sets of propagation parameters. The proposed model explains the existence of ""pinhole"" channels which exhibit low spatial fading correlation at both ends of the link but still have poor rank properties, and hence, low ergodic capacity. In fact, the model suggests the existence of a more general family of channels spanning continuously from full rank i.i.d. to low-rank pinhole cases. We suggest guidelines for predicting high rank (and hence, high ergodic capacity) in MIMO channels, and show that even at long ranges, high channel rank can easily be sustained under mild scattering conditions. Finally, we validate our results by simulations using ray tracing techniques. Connections with basic antenna theory are made.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2002.806555","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1175470","","MIMO;Predictive models;Fading;Channel capacity;Scattering;Transmitters;Antenna arrays;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Antennas and propagation","MIMO systems;radiowave propagation;channel capacity;antenna arrays;electromagnetic wave scattering;receiving antennas;transmitting antennas;correlation methods;Rayleigh channels;ray tracing","outdoor MIMO wireless channels;performance prediction;multiple input multiple output fading channels;capacity performance;independent identically distributed model;full rank i.i.d channel;channel capacity;scattering radii;transmitter;receiver;transmit arrays;receive arrays;antenna beamwidth;antenna spacing;MIMO capacity;spatial fading correlation;condition number;channel matrix;propagation parameters;pinhole channels;high ergodic capacity;long ranges;scattering conditions;simulations;ray tracing;antenna theory;Rayleigh channel","","582","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The limited ability of individual sensor nodes to thwart failure or attack makes ensuring network availability more difficult.

Univ. of Singapore, Singapore; NA","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","","2002","17","4","543","557","Switched reluctance (SR) motors have an intrinsic simplicity and low cost that make them well suited to many applications. However the motor's doubly salient structure and highly nonuniform torque and magnetization characteristics lead to the inability to excite the motor using conventional AC motor waveforms, or apply established AC motor rotating field theory to the motor. Furthermore, high torque ripple is inherent in the motor unless a torque ripple reduction strategy is employed. Thus, control of the motor is difficult and complex compared to other machines. Previous methods of control have fallen into two main categories: those which use a simplified linear model and those which account for the motor saturation. The simplified linear model schemes have the advantage of simplicity and tractability but are inaccurate in most practical SR drives, whereas the nonlinear schemes have the problem of high complexity and computational expensiveness which makes real-time implementation difficult. To overcome these problems, in this paper, a novel control method for the SR motor is derived from analysis of the nonuniform torque characteristics of the motor. The control method applies the philosophy of direct torque control (DTC). Unlike previous direct torque control schemes for the SR motor drive, the new method does not involve short flux patterns, a change of the motor winding configuration, or the use of a bipolar current drive. Thus, the scheme can be conveniently implemented on any normal type of SR motor drive. In addition, the scheme overcomes the problems associated with torque ripple control in the SR motor by regulating the torque output of the motor within a hysteresis band. Furthermore, the scheme is very simple and can be implemented in real-time with low cost microprocessor hardware.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2002.800968","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1016803","","Torque control;Reluctance motors;AC motors;Hysteresis motors;Strontium;Costs;Motor drives;Magnetization;Microprocessors;Hardware","reluctance motor drives;machine control;torque control;magnetic flux;magnetic variables control;magnetisation","flux control method;switched reluctance motor drives;torque control method;doubly salient structure;highly nonuniform torque characteristics;nonuniform magnetization characteristics;motor excitation methods;AC motor waveforms;torque ripple reduction strategy;simplified linear model;motor saturation;simplified linear model schemes;direct torque control;short flux patterns;motor winding configuration;bipolar current drive;hysteresis band","","128","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A number of reduced-complexity methods for turbo equalization have been introduced in which MAP equalization is replaced with suboptimal, low-complexity approaches. We explore a number of low-complexity soft-input/soft-output (SISO) equalization algorithms based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. This includes the extension of existing approaches to general signal constellations and the derivation of a novel approach requiring less complexity than the MMSE-optimal solution. All approaches are qualitatively analyzed by observing the mean-square error averaged over a sequence of equalized data.

The proposed decision model enables optimal inspection and replacement decision in order to balance the cost engaged by failure and unavailability on an infinite horizon. Two maintenance decision variables are considered: the preventive replacement threshold and the inspection schedule based on the system state. In order to assess the performance of the proposed maintenance structure, a mathematical model for the maintained system cost is developed using regenerative and semi-regenerative processes theory. Numerical experiments show that the s-expected maintenance cost rate on an infinite horizon can be minimized by a joint optimization of the replacement threshold and the a periodic inspection times. The proposed maintenance structure performs better than classical preventive maintenance policies which can be treated as particular cases. Using the proposed maintenance structure, a well-adapted strategy can automatically be selected for the maintenance decision-maker depending on the characteristics of the wear process and on the different unit costs. Even limit cases can be reached: for example, in the case of expensive inspection and costly preventive replacement, the optimal policy becomes close to a systematic periodic replacement policy. Most of the classical maintenance strategies (periodic inspection/replacement policy, systematic periodic replacement, corrective policy) can be emulated by adopting some specific inspection scheduling rules and replacement thresholds. In a more general way, the proposed maintenance structure shows its adaptability to different possible characteristics of the maintained single-unit system.","1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2002.1011518","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1011518","","Inspection;Cost function;Mathematical model;Chromium;Infinite horizon;Preventive maintenance;Predictive maintenance;Time measurement;Random variables;Shape","maintenance engineering;scheduling;inspection;optimisation","continuous-time predictive-maintenance;gradually deteriorating system;decision model;optimal inspection;optimal replacement decision;failure;unavailability;infinite horizon;preventive replacement threshold;maintenance structure;mathematical model;regenerative processes theory;semi-regenerative processes theory;s-expected maintenance cost rate;a periodic inspection times;wear process;optimal policy;systematic periodic replacement policy;maintenance strategies;renewal process","","251","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Variable-speed wind power generation using doubly fed wound rotor induction machine-a comparison with alternative schemes","R. Datta; V. T. Ranganathan","ABB Corporate Res. Centre, Ladenburg, Germany; NA","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","","2002","17","3","414","421","In this paper, a wind energy conversion system (WECS) using a grid-connected wound rotor induction machine controlled from the rotor side is compared with both fixed speed and variable speed systems using a cage rotor induction machine. The comparison is done on, the basis of: (1) major hardware components required; (2) operating region; and (3) energy output due to a defined wind function using the characteristics of a practical wind turbine. Although a fixed speed system is more simple and reliable, it severely limits the energy output of a wind turbine. In case of variable speed systems, comparison shows that using a wound rotor induction machine of similar rating can significantly enhance energy capture. This comes about due to the ability to operate with rated torque even at supersynchronous speeds; power is then generated out of the rotor as well as the stator. Moreover, with rotor side control, the voltage rating of the power devices and DC bus capacitor bank is reduced. The size of the line side inductor also decreased. Results are presented to show the substantial advantages of the doubly fed system.","1558-0059","","10.1109/TEC.2002.801993","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1033974","","Wind power generation;Wounds;Rotors;Induction machines;Wind turbines;Wind energy;Control systems;Hardware;Power system reliability;Energy capture","wind power plants;wind turbines;turbogenerators;asynchronous generators;rotors;variable speed gear;machine theory","doubly-fed wound rotor induction machine;variable-speed wind power generation;wind energy conversion system;grid-connected wound rotor induction machine;rotor side control;hardware components;operating region;energy output;wind turbine;energy capture;supersynchronous speeds;rated torque operation;voltage rating reduction;power devices;DC bus capacitor bank","","326","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This ""Blobworld"" representation is created by clustering pixels in a joint color-texture-position feature space. The segmentation algorithm is fully automatic and has been run on a collection of 10,000 natural images. We describe a system that uses the Blobworld representation to retrieve images from this collection. An important aspect of the system is that the user is allowed to view the internal representation of the submitted image and the query results. Similar systems do not offer the user this view into the workings of the system; consequently, query results from these systems can be inexplicable, despite the availability of knobs for adjusting the similarity metrics. By finding image regions that roughly correspond to objects, we allow querying at the level of objects rather than global image properties. We present results indicating that querying for images using Blobworld produces higher precision than does querying using color and texture histograms of the entire image in cases where the image contains distinctive objects.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2002.1023800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1023800","","Image segmentation;Image retrieval;Image representation;Pixel;Information retrieval;Clustering algorithms;Histograms;Image databases;Web sites;Image recognition","image segmentation;image retrieval;content-based retrieval;optimisation;image colour analysis;image texture;image representation;pattern clustering;relevance feedback","Blobworld;image segmentation;expectation maximization;image querying;image retrieval;image collections;image content;image representation;raw pixel data;image regions;colour coherence;image texture coherence;pixel clustering;joint color-texture-position feature space;fully automatic algorithm;knobs;similarity metrics adjustment;precision;color histograms;texture histograms;grouping;object-level querying","","867","","47","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It appears unlikely that wide bandgap semiconductor devices will find much use in low-power transistor applications until the ambient temperature exceeds approximately 300/spl deg/C, as commercially available silicon and silicon-on-insulator technologies are already satisfying requirements for digital and analog VLSI in this temperature range. However practical operation of silicon power devices at ambient temperatures above 200/spl deg/C appears problematic, as self-heating at higher power levels results in high internal junction temperatures and leakages. Thus, most electronic subsystems that simultaneously require high-temperature and high-power operation will necessarily be realized using wide bandgap devices, once they become widely available.

However, instead of binary, numeric, or symbolic representation, QEA uses a Q-bit, defined as the smallest unit of information, for the probabilistic representation and a Q-bit individual as a string of Q-bits. A Q-gate is introduced as a variation operator to drive the individuals toward better solutions. To demonstrate its effectiveness and applicability, experiments were carried out on the knapsack problem, which is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem.

Many challenges must be overcome before the concept of sensor networks In particular, there are two critical problems underlying successful operation of sensor networks: (1) efficient methods for exchanging information between the nodes and (2) collaborative signal processing (CSP) between the nodes to gather useful information about the physical world. This article describes the key ideas behind the CSP algorithms for distributed sensor networks being developed at the University of Wisconsin (UW). We also describe the basic ideas on how the CSP algorithms interface with the networking/routing algorithms being developed at Wisconsin (UW-API). We motivate the framework via the problem of detecting and tracking a single maneuvering target.

The method is based on use of a short-current pulse of the PV to determine an optimum operating current where the maximum output power can be obtained and completely differs from conventional hill-climbing-based methods. In the proposed system, the optimum operating current is instantaneously determined simply by taking a product of the short-current pulse amplitude and a parameter k because the optimum operating current is exactly proportional to the short current under various conditions of illuminance and temperature. Also, the system offers an identification capability of k by means of fast power-versus-current curve scanning, which makes the short-current pulse-based MPPT method adaptive to disturbances such as shades partially covering the PV panels and surface contamination. The above adaptive MPPT algorithm has been introduced into a current-controlled boost chopper and a multiple power converter system composed of PV-and-chopper modules. Various operating characteristics have experimentally been examined on this multiple PV-and-chopper module system from a practical viewpoint and excellent MPPT performance has been confirmed through the tests.","1557-9948","","10.1109/41.982265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=982265","","Photovoltaic systems;Solar power generation;Power generation;Temperature;Surface contamination;Choppers;System testing;Pollution measurement;Databases;Power measurement","photovoltaic power systems;solar cell arrays;power system control;adaptive control;choppers (circuits);DC-DC power convertors;control system synthesis;optimal control","short-current pulse-based maximum-power-point tracking method;multiple photovoltaic-and-converter module system;PV power system control design;photovoltaic power generation systems;optimum operating current;fast power-versus-current curve scanning;disturbances;PV modules;chopper modules;operating characteristics;control performance","","425","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Fabricating metallic structures from nanoparticles avoids the extreme processing conditions required for standard lithographic fabrication and molten-metal-droplet deposition. Nanoparticles typically measure 1 to 100 nm in diameter and can be sintered at plastic-compatible temperatures as low as 300/spl deg/C to form material nearly indistinguishable from the bulk material. Multiple ink-jet print heads mounted to a computer-controlled 3-axis gantry deposit the 10% by weight metal colloid ink layer-by-layer onto a heated substrate to make two-dimensional (2-D) and 3-D structures. We report a high-Q resonant inductive coil, linear and rotary electrostatic-drive motors, and in-plane and vertical electrothermal actuators. The devices, printed in minutes with a 100 /spl mu/m feature size, were made out of silver and gold material with high conductivity,and feature as many as 400 layers, insulators, 10:1 vertical aspect ratios, and etch-released mechanical structure. These results suggest a route to a desktop or large-area MEMS fabrication system characterized by many layers, low cost, and data-driven fabrication for rapid turn-around time, and represent the first use of ink-jet printing to build active MEMS.","1941-0158","","10.1109/84.982863","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=982863","","Ink jet printing;Microelectromechanical systems;Micromechanical devices;Fabrication;Nanoparticles;Circuits;Temperature;Two dimensional displays;Resonance;Coils","microactuators;electrostatic motors;nanotechnology;sintering;ink jet printers","ink-jet printed nanoparticle microelectromechanical systems;3D microelectromechanical systems;nanoparticle metal colloids;plastic-compatible sintering temperatures;high-Q resonant inductive coil;electrostatic-drive motors;electrothermal actuators;etch-released mechanical structure;rapid turn-around time;1 to 100 nm;300 degC;100 micron","","424","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Eng., Connecticut Univ., Storrs, CT, USA","IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","","2002","47","5","793","797","A general class of linear time invariant systems with time delay is studied. Recently, they attracted considerable interest in the systems and control community. The complexity arises due to the exponential type transcendental terms in their characteristic equation. The transcendentality brings infinitely many characteristic roots, which are cumbersome to elaborate as evident from the literature. A number of methodologies have been suggested with limited ability to assess the stability in the parametric domain of time delay. This study offers an exact, structured and robust methodology to bring a closure to the question at hand. Ultimately we present a unique explicit analytical expression in terms of the system parameters which not only reveals the stability regions (pockets) in the domain of time delay, but it also declares the number of unstable characteristic roots at any given pocket. The method starts with the determination of all possible purely imaginary (resonant) characteristic roots for any positive time delay. To achieve this a simplifying substitution is used for the transcendental terms in the characteristic equation. It is proven that the number of such resonant roots for a given dynamics is finite. Each one of these roots is created by infinitely many time delays, which are periodically distributed. An interesting property is also claimed next, that the root crossing directions at these locations are invariant with respect to the delay and dependent only on the crossing frequency. These two unique findings facilitate a simple and practical stability method, which is the highlight of the work.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2002.1000275","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1000275","","Stability analysis;Delay effects;Equations;Resonance;Time invariant systems;Control systems;Robustness;Frequency;Delay lines;Polynomials","polynomials;stability;delays;linear systems;time-varying systems;robust control","exact method;stability analysis;time-delayed linear time-invariant systems;exponential type transcendental terms;characteristic equation;robust methodology;explicit analytical expression;system parameters;commensurate time delay","","407","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Confocal microwave imaging involves illuminating the breast with an ultra-wideband pulse from a number of antenna locations, then synthetically focusing reflections from the breast. The detection of malignant tumors is achieved by the coherent addition of returns from these strongly scattering objects. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of detecting and localizing small (<1 cm) tumors in three dimensions with numerical models of two system configurations involving synthetic cylindrical and planar antenna arrays. Image formation algorithms are developed to enhance tumor responses and reduce early- and late-time clutter. The early-time clutter consists of the incident pulse and reflections from the skin, while the late-time clutter is primarily due to the heterogeneity of breast tissue. Successful detection of 6-mm-diameter spherical tumors is achieved with both planar and cylindrical systems, and similar performance measures are obtained. The influences of the synthetic array size and position relative to the tumor are also explored.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2002.800759","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019445","","Microwave imaging;Breast cancer;Cancer detection;Breast neoplasms;Breast tissue;Reflection;Breast tumors;Dielectrics;Ultra wideband technology;Microwave antennas","microwave imaging;medical image processing;image reconstruction;backscatter;mammography;cancer;clutter;tumours;motion compensation","confocal microwave imaging;breast tumor detection;dielectric properties contrast;malignant breast tissues;normal breast tissues;image reconstruction;ultra-wideband pulse;coherent addition of returns;strongly scattering objects;three dimensional localization;numerical models;synthetic cylindrical antenna arrays;synthetic planar antenna arrays;image formation algorithms;early-time clutter;late-time clutter;tissue heterogeneity;spherical tumors;synthetic array size;array position;object detection;three-dimensional volumetric map;backscatter;single-signal analysis","Algorithms;Breast Neoplasms;Calibration;Computer Simulation;Electromagnetics;Equipment Design;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Microscopy, Confocal;Microwaves;Models, Anatomic;Phantoms, Imaging;Sensitivity and Specificity","503","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most of these technologies are of considerably smaller scale than conventional synchronous generators and are therefore connected to distribution grids. Further, many are based on technologies different from the synchronous generator, such as the squirrel cage induction generator and high or low speed generators that are grid coupled through a power electronic converter. When connected in small amounts, the impact of distributed generation on power system transient stability will be negligible. However, if its penetration level becomes higher, distributed generation may start to influence the dynamic behavior of the power system as a whole. In this paper, the impact of distributed generation technology and penetration level on the dynamics of a test system is investigated. It is found that the effects of distributed generation on the dynamics of a power system strongly depend on the technology of the distributed generators.","","0-7803-7518-1","10.1109/PESS.2002.1043465","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1043465","","Distributed control;Power system transients;Power system stability;Power system dynamics;Induction generators;Power generation;Synchronous generators;Mesh generation;Power electronics;System testing","power system transient stability;distributed power generation","distributed generation;power system transient stability;dispersed generation;power system dynamics;electrical power systems;distribution grids;squirrel cage induction generator;low speed generators;high speed generators;power electronic converter","","130","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The UT is a method for predicting means and covariances in nonlinear systems. A set of samples are deterministically chosen which match the mean and covariance of a (not necessarily Gaussian-distributed) probability distribution. These samples can be scaled by an arbitrary constant. The method guarantees that the mean and covariance second order accuracy in mean and covariance, giving the same performance as a second order truncated filter but without the need to calculate any Jacobians or Hessians.

Univ., South Korea; NA","IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","","2002","13","1","143","159","Feature selection plays an important role in classifying systems such as neural networks (NNs). We use a set of attributes which are relevant, irrelevant or redundant and from the viewpoint of managing a dataset which can be huge, reducing the number of attributes by selecting only the relevant ones is desirable. In doing so, higher performances with lower computational effort is expected. In this paper, we propose two feature selection algorithms. The limitation of mutual information feature selector (MIFS) is analyzed and a method to overcome this limitation is studied. One of the proposed algorithms makes more considered use of mutual information between input attributes and output classes than the MIFS. What is demonstrated is that the proposed method can provide the performance of the ideal greedy selection algorithm when information is distributed uniformly. The computational load for this algorithm is nearly the same as that of MIFS. In addition, another feature selection algorithm using the Taguchi method is proposed. This is advanced as a solution to the question as to how to identify good features with as few experiments as possible. The proposed algorithms are applied to several classification problems and compared with MIFS. These two algorithms can be combined to complement each other's limitations. The combined algorithm performed well in several experiments and should prove to be a useful method in selecting features for classification problems.","1941-0093","","10.1109/72.977291","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=977291","","Mutual information;Neural networks;Biological neural networks;Principal component analysis;Decision trees;High performance computing;Information analysis;Data mining;Educational technology;Educational programs","neural nets;pattern classification","neural networks;classifying systems;feature selection;Taguchi method;mutual information feature selector","","546","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present two techniques to improve the performance and reduce the complexity of channel parameter estimation: optimum training-sequence design and simplified channel estimation. The optimal training sequences not only simplify the initial channel estimation, but also attain the best estimation performance. The simplified channel estimation significantly reduces the complexity of the channel estimation at the expense of a negligible performance degradation. The effectiveness of the new techniques is demonstrated through the simulation of an OFDM system with two-transmit and two-receive antennas. The space-time coding with 240 information bits per codeword is used for transmit diversity. From the simulation, the required signal-to-noise ratio is only about 9 dB for a 10% word error rate for a channel with the typical urban- or hilly-terrain delay profile and a 40-Hz Doppler frequency.","1558-2248","","10.1109/7693.975446","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=975446","","Channel estimation;OFDM;Transmitting antennas;Parameter estimation;Diversity reception;Frequency estimation;Mobile antennas;Degradation;Wireless communication;Interference","OFDM modulation;parameter estimation;diversity reception;transmitting antennas;computational complexity;mobile radio;telecommunication channels;channel capacity","OFDM system;multiple transmit antennas;parameter estimation;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;complexity reduction;optimum training-sequence design;simplified channel estimation;multiple transmit-and-receive antennas;space-time coding;transmit diversity;signal-to-noise ratio;word error rate;hilly-terrain delay profile;urban delay profile;MIMO systems;communication capacity;communication quality;mobile wireless systems;Doppler frequency;40 Hz","","432","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We use a noncoherent block fading model proposed by Marzetta and Hochwald (see ibid. vol.45, p.139-57, 1999). The model does not assume any channel side information at the receiver or at the transmitter, but assumes that the coefficients remain constant for a coherence interval of length T symbol periods. We compute the asymptotic capacity of this channel at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in terms of the coherence time T, the number of transmit antennas M, and the number of receive antennas N. While the capacity gain of the coherent multiple antenna channel is min{M, N} bits per second per Hertz for every 3-dB increase in SNR, the corresponding gain for the noncoherent channel turns out to be M* (1 - M*/T) bits per second per Hertz, where M*=min{M, N, [T/2]}.

In this case, the control of the circulating current becomes an important objective in the converter design.

The selected cells are subject to an affinity maturation process, which improves their affinity to the selective Ag's. This paper proposes a computational implementation of the clonal selection principle that explicitly takes into account the affinity maturation of the immune response. The general algorithm, named CLONALG, is derived primarily to perform machine learning and pattern recognition tasks, and then it is adapted to solve optimization problems, emphasizing multimodal and combinatorial optimization. Two versions of the algorithm are derived, their computational cost per iteration is presented, and a sensitivity analysis in relation to the user-defined parameters is given.

New modeling and identification techniques are proposed to overcome these problems. A pure integrator is employed for stator flux estimation which permits high-estimation bandwidth. Compensation of the drift components is done by offset identification. The nonlinear voltage distortions are corrected by a self-adjusting inverter model.

The tuning curve becomes strongly dependent on the oscillator bias current. As a result, the practical tuning range is reduced and the upconverted flicker noise of the bias current dominates the 1/f/sup 3/ close-in phase noise, even if the waveform symmetry has been assured. A first-order estimation of the tuning curve for MOS-varactor-tuned VCOs is provided. Based on this result, a simplified phase-noise model for double cross-coupled VCOs is derived. This model can be easily adapted to cover other LC-tuned oscillator topologies. The theoretical analyses are experimentally validated with a 0.25 /spl mu/m CMOS fully integrated VCO for 5 GHz wireless LAN receivers.

We have done over 10,000 HSPICE simulation runs of all the different adders in different input patterns, frequencies, and load capacitances. Almost all those new adders consume less power in high frequencies, while three new adders consistently consume on average 10% less power and have higher speed compared with the previous 10-transistor full adder and the conventional 28-transistor CMOS adder.

Three critical requirements drive the implementation of a software model: performance, flexibility, and detail. Performance determines the amount of workload the model can exercise given the machine resources available for simulation. Flexibility indicates how well the model is structured to simplify modification, permitting design variants or even completely different designs to be modeled with ease. Detail defines the level of abstraction used to implement the model's components. The SimpleScalar tool set provides an infrastructure for simulation and architectural modeling. It can model a variety of platforms ranging from simple unpipelined processors to detailed dynamically scheduled microarchitectures with multiple-level memory hierarchies. SimpleScalar simulators reproduce computing device operations by executing all program instructions using an interpreter.

New and innovative solutions to minimize noise, especially common mode conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI), in power electronic circuits continue to be developed. In this paper, the authors investigate to what extent EMI caused by power electronic devices in hard switching inverter topologies can be minimized using ultra-low inductive planar busbars. The concept followed in this study is to tackle EMI directly at the source where most EMI is generated; in other words, to reduce the parasitic magnetic energy stored in the inverter DC link to reduce high voltage spikes during switching.

A Lie group formalism is used to cast the motion computation problem into simple geometric terms so that tracking becomes a simple optimization problem solved by means of iterative reweighted least squares. A visual servoing system constructed using this framework is presented together with results showing the accuracy of the tracker. The paper then describes how this tracking system has been extended to provide a general framework for tracking in complex configurations.

Adjusting the rotor speed makes the machine either release the kinetic energy to the power system or absorb it from the utility grid. Thus, the machine has the capability of achieving not only reactive-power control, but also active-power control based on the flywheel effect of the rotating parts. This paper proposes a new control strategy for a doubly-fed induction machine intended as a flywheel energy storage system, which is characterized by the combination of vector control and decoupling control. The control strategy enables the induction machine to perform active-power control independent of reactive-power control even in transient states. The validity of the theory developed in this paper, along with the effectiveness and viability of the control strategy, is confirmed by computer simulation. In addition, this paper discusses a transient behavior of a magnetizing current in the induction machine.","1941-0107","","10.1109/63.988676","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=988676","","Induction machines;Pulse width modulation;Flywheels;Energy storage;Pulse power systems;Control systems;Power system transients;Voltage;Space vector pulse width modulation;Kinetic energy","induction motors;asynchronous generators;machine control;flywheels;control system synthesis;machine theory;PWM invertors;DC-AC power convertors;PWM power convertors;AC-DC power convertors;rectifying circuits;electric machine analysis computing;control system analysis computing;power control","doubly-fed induction machine;flywheel energy storage system;cycloconverter;voltage-source pulse width modulation rectifier-inverter;AC exciter;control design;reactive power control;active power control;vector control;decoupling control;control simulation;computer simulation","","226","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We quantify the SER due to high-energy neutrons in SRAM cells, latches, and logic circuits for feature sizes from 600 nm to 50 nm and clock periods from 16 to 6 fan-out-of-4 inverter delays.

It also describes the functional overview and applications of Bluetooth, and deals with the development of a model for recording, printing, monitoring, and controlling of eight process variables at the same time, using a distributed control system.

Industrial automation, in terms of controlling or monitoring a factory, office, or industrial process, means to install machines that can do the work instead of human workers. Industrial plants consists of many devices interconnected in different ways ranging from simple data collection units (I/O) to more intelligent devices such as sensors, one-loop controllers, or programmable controllers, and a supervisory system used as a human-machine interface (HMI) for data logging and supervisory control. An IISS is a controlling device that monitors the devices in a company. It basically communicates via the interface card in the PC; the hardware is connected parallel across the device, and it is interfaced with the PC via a transceiver. The device can be accessed both manually via the switches and remotely via the PC. A simulation of connecting a PC with the machines in a company was executed.

We outline these challenges and discuss approaches to solutions.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2002.1106162","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1106162","","Data security;Roads;Authentication;Privacy;Business;Wireless LAN;Cellular networks;Computer hacking;Interference;Layout","wireless LAN;telecommunication standards;IEEE standards;business communication;broadband networks;Internet;telecommunication security;security of data;virtual private networks;computer network management;land mobile radio","WiFi;wireless local area networking;virtual private network;native security;network management;mobility;business;home environments;private applications;hotspots;broadband Internet access;IEEE 802.11b standard","","69","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The clipping is performed on the baseband OFDM signals with and without oversampling, followed by the ideal low-pass filter. First, the effect of the envelope clipping on the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and the instantaneous power of the band-limited OFDM signal is studied. We then discuss the channel capacity of the oversampled and clipped OFDM signals over the additive white Gaussian noise and ideally interleaved Rayleigh fading channels. The capacity is calculated based on the assumption that the distortion terms caused by the clipping are Gaussian. It is shown that the SNR penalty due to the clipping can be considerably alleviated by using optimal coding and reducing the information data rate. The results are justified by the simulation results using near optimal turbo codes.","1558-0857","","10.1109/26.975762","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=975762","","Performance analysis;OFDM;Channel capacity;Peak to average power ratio;Degradation;Baseband;Low pass filters;Additive white noise;Fading;Signal to noise ratio","OFDM modulation;channel capacity;signal sampling;low-pass filters;filtering theory;bandlimited signals;AWGN channels;Rayleigh channels;turbo codes;channel coding","performance analysis;clipped OFDM signals;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;peak power reduction;channel capacity;baseband OFDM signals;ideal low-pass filter;envelope clipping;peak-to-average power ratio;PAPR;channel coding;signal-to-distortion ratio;band-limited OFDM signal;oversampled OFDM signals;additive white Gaussian noise channels;interleaved Rayleigh fading channels;Gaussian distortion;SNR penalty;optimal coding;information data rate reduction;simulation results;near optimal turbo codes","","445","","39","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These schemes typically try to find the minimum energy path to optimize energy usage at a node. In this paper we take the view that always using lowest energy paths may not be optimal from the point of view of network lifetime and long-term connectivity. To optimize these measures, we propose a new scheme called energy aware routing that uses sub-optimal paths occasionally to provide substantial gains. Simulation results are also presented that show increase in network lifetimes of up to 40% over comparable schemes like directed diffusion routing. Nodes also burn energy in a more equitable way across the network ensuring a more graceful degradation of service with time.","","0-7803-7376-6","10.1109/WCNC.2002.993520","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=993520","","Wireless sensor networks;Degradation;Toy manufacturing industry;Routing protocols;Energy measurement;Gain measurement;Intelligent sensors;Automatic control;Robot control;Manufacturing automation","telecommunication network routing;packet radio networks;distributed sensors;protocols","sensor networks;network lifetime;sub-optimal paths;dense wireless networks;heterogeneous nodes;long-term connectivity;energy aware routing;routing protocols","","607","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

EPONs are designed to carry Ethernet frames at standard Ethernet rates. An EPON uses a single trunk fiber that extends from a central office to a passive optical splitter, which then fans out to multiple optical drop fibers connected to subscriber nodes. Other than the end terminating equipment, no component in the network requires electrical power, hence the term passive. Local carriers have long been interested in passive optical networks for the benefits they offer: minimal fiber infrastructure and no powering requirement in the outside plant. With Ethernet now emerging as the protocol of choice for carrying IP traffic in metro and access networks, EPON has emerged as a potential optimized architecture for fiber to the building and fiber to the home.","1558-1896","","10.1109/35.983910","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=983910","","EPON;Next generation networking;Optical fiber devices;Ethernet networks;Passive optical networks;Buildings;Optical fiber networks;Central office;Fans;Access protocols","optical fibre LAN;optical fibre subscriber loops","Ethernet passive optical networks;EPON;next-generation optical access network;local subscriber access architecture;point-to-multipoint fiber infrastructure;low-cost fiber infrastructure;Ethernet rates;trunk fiber;central office;passive optical splitter;multiple optical drop fibers;subscriber nodes;end terminating equipment;protocol;IP traffic;optimized architecture;fiber to the home;FTTH","","427","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This paper describes the structure and the design aspects of a fuzzy PID controller based on Sugeono's fuzzy technique with fuzzy-neural implementation. There are two possibilities to obtain a three-term fuzzy PID controller similar to the conventional digital PID controller. The first one is a velocity type fuzzy PID controller and the second one is the positioning type fuzzy PID controller. The antecedent part of the applied fuzzy rules contains a linear function, similar to the discrete equation of the corresponding conventional PID controller. The paper contains the structure and description of this implementation as well as investigations toward the applied fuzzy PID control algorithms.

In this paper we model data-centric routing and compare its performance with traditional end-to-end routing schemes. We examine the impact of source-destination placement and communication network density on the energy costs and delay associated with data aggregation. We show that data-centric routing offers significant performance gains across a wide range of operational scenarios.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the different roles of established and new firms in disruptive technology commercialization. The authors begin by developing a model of the innovation process beginning with technology creation and ending with user adoption and application. From this model they develop propositions for testing. The authors use survey data collected from 72 micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) manufacturing firms. Their results from the MEMS industry show that established firms rarely commercialize disruptive technologies and then prefer to use market-pull strategies to accomplish this. New firms select primarily disruptive technologies and choose either market-pull or technology-push strategies for commercialization. Perhaps more important, time to market for new firms is one-fourth that for established firms. These results suggest that new firms have two advantages in commercialization of disruptive technologies-flexibility in marketing strategy and much shorter times to market.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2002.806718","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176863","","Product development;Microelectromechanical devices;Manufacturing","innovation management;product development;micromechanical devices;manufacture","disruptive technologies;market strategies differentiation;small firms;innovations;R&D management;commercialization process;technology creation;user adoption;micro-electro-mechanical systems;MEMS manufacturing firms;market-pull strategies;technology-push strategies","","112","","45","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"DENFIS: dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference system and its application for time-series prediction","N. K. Kasabov; Qun Song","Dept. of Inf. Sci., Otago Univ., Dunedin, New Zealand; NA","IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","","2002","10","2","144","154","This paper introduces a new type of fuzzy inference systems, denoted as dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference system (DENFIS), for adaptive online and offline learning, and their application for dynamic time series prediction. DENFIS evolve through incremental, hybrid (supervised/unsupervised), learning, and accommodate new input data, including new features, new classes, etc., through local element tuning. New fuzzy rules are created and updated during the operation of the system. At each time moment, the output of DENFIS is calculated through a fuzzy inference system based on m-most activated fuzzy rules which are dynamically chosen from a fuzzy rule set. Two approaches are proposed: (1) dynamic creation of a first-order Takagi-Sugeno-type fuzzy rule set for a DENFIS online model; and (2) creation of a first-order Takagi-Sugeno-type fuzzy rule set, or an expanded high-order one, for a DENFIS offline model. A set of fuzzy rules can be inserted into DENFIS before or during its learning process. Fuzzy rules can also be extracted during or after the learning process. An evolving clustering method (ECM), which is employed in both online and offline DENFIS models, is also introduced. It is demonstrated that DENFIS can effectively learn complex temporal sequences in an adaptive way and outperform some well-known, existing models.","1941-0034","","10.1109/91.995117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=995117","","Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy systems;Adaptive systems;Artificial intelligence;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Fuzzy logic;Clustering methods;Electrochemical machining","inference mechanisms;fuzzy neural nets;time series;learning (artificial intelligence);adaptive systems;evolutionary computation;pattern clustering;fuzzy set theory","DENFIS;dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference system;time-series prediction;adaptive online learning;adaptive offline learning;dynamic time series prediction;hybrid learning;local element tuning;fuzzy rules;fuzzy inference system;first-order Takagi-Sugeno-type fuzzy rule set;learning process;evolving clustering method;complex temporal sequences","","806","","69","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The thematic changes are shown in the context of a time-line and corresponding external events. The focus on temporal thematic change within a context framework allows a user to discern patterns that suggest relationships or trends. For example, the sudden change of thematic strength following an external event may indicate a causal relationship. Such patterns are not readily accessible in other visualizations of the data. We use a river metaphor to convey several key notions. The document collection's time-line, selected thematic content and thematic strength are indicated by the river's directed flow, composition and changing width, respectively. The directed flow from left to right is interpreted as movement through time and the horizontal distance between two points on the river defines a time interval. At any point in time, the vertical distance, or width, of the river indicates the collective strength of the selected themes. Colored ""currents"" flowing within the river represent individual themes. A current's vertical width narrows or broadens to indicate decreases or increases in the strength of the individual theme.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.981848","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=981848","","Data visualization;Rivers;Computer Society;Information retrieval;Self organizing feature maps;Wire;Humans;Graphics;Displays","data visualisation;information analysis","ThemeRiver;thematic change visualization;large document collections;thematic variations;time-line;external events;temporal change;context framework;pattern discernment;relationships;trend analysis;thematic strength;causality;river metaphor;selected thematic content;directed flow;river composition;river width;coloured currents","","348","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Tunneling behavior dominates throughout all injection regimes in a device with a high density of defects in the space-charge region, which act as deep-level carrier traps. However, in a high-quality LED diode, temperature-dependent diffusion-recombination current has been identified with an ideality factor of 1.6 at moderate biases.

In the high-quality LED, nonradiative recombination centers are saturated at current densities as low as 1.4 /spl times/ 10/sup -2/ A/cm/sup 2/.

A double resonator equivalent circuit model is presented and used to estimate the impedance bandwidth and the respective distributions of radiation losses with typical parameter values at 900 and 1800 MHz. It is noticed that at 900 MHz, the radiation losses of the antenna element wavemode represent typically less than 10% of the total power. Thus, the antenna element works mainly as a matching element, which couples to the low-Q resonant wavemode of the chassis. At 1800 MHz, the contribution of the antenna element wavemode is larger. By enhancing the coupling and by tuning the chassis resonance, it is possible to obtain an impedance bandwidth of over 50% (6 dB return loss) at both at 900 and 1800 MHz. The results given by the equivalent circuit study are fully supported by those of three-dimensional phone-model simulations, including calculation of the SAR and efficiency values. In prototyping, the 6 dB bandwidth of 5.5% was obtained at 980 MHz with a nonradiating coupling element with a volume of 1.6 cm/sup 3/ on a 120 mm long chassis.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2002.802085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1137540","","Mobile handsets;Mobile antennas;Resonance;Bandwidth;Equivalent circuits;Impedance;Coupling circuits;Telephone sets;Performance analysis;Circuit optimization","mobile handsets;mobile antennas;antenna theory;resonators;equivalent circuits;parameter estimation;electric impedance;Q-factor;electromagnetic coupling;microstrip antennas","mobile handset antenna;mobile handset chassis;resonant wavemodes;double resonator equivalent circuit;impedance bandwidth;radiation losses;matching element;specific absorption rate;patch antenna;planar inverted-F antenna;900 MHz;1800 MHz;980 MHz;120 mm","","364","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This contrasts with the mass element which, by definition, always has one terminal connected to ground. The inerter allows electrical circuits to be translated over to mechanical ones in a completely analogous way. The inerter need not have large mass. This allows any arbitrary positive-real impedance to be synthesized mechanically using physical components which may be assumed to have small mass compared to other structures to which they may be attached.

This work will examine two major causes of the short retention (assuming no significant mobile ionic charge motion in the ferroelectric film): 1) depolarization field and 2) finite gate leakage current.

Sch., Oxford Univ., UK; NA","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","","2002","17","3","626","632","In recent years, a large amount of literature has evolved on the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for electric load forecasting. ANNs are particularly appealing because of their ability to model an unspecified nonlinear relationship between load and weather variables. Weather forecasts are a key input when the ANN is used for forecasting. This paper investigates the use of weather ensemble predictions in the application of ANNs to load forecasting for lead times from one to ten days ahead. A weather ensemble prediction consists of multiple scenarios for a weather variable. We use these scenarios to produce multiple scenarios for load. The results show that the average of the load scenarios is a more accurate load forecast than that produced using traditional weather forecasts. We use the load scenarios to estimate the uncertainty in the ANN load forecast. This compares favorably with estimates based solely on historical load forecast errors.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2002.800906","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1033703","","Neural networks;Load forecasting;Weather forecasting;Artificial neural networks;Predictive models;Random variables;Uncertainty;Economic forecasting;Load modeling;Linear regression","load forecasting;power engineering computing;neural nets;weather forecasting","neural networks;weather ensemble predictions;neural network load forecasting;artificial neural networks;electric load forecasting;unspecified nonlinear relationship;weather variables;load variables;weather forecasts;key input;multiple load scenarios;uncertainty estimation;historical load forecast errors;England;Wales","","267","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using the driver command, the state of charge of the energy storage, and the motor/generator speed, a set of rules have been developed, in a fuzzy controller, to effectively determine the split between the two powerplants: electric motor and internal combustion engine. The underlying theme of the fuzzy rules is to optimize the operational efficiency of all components, considered as one system. Simulation results were used to assess the performance of the controller. A forward-looking hybrid vehicle model was used for implementation and simulation of the controller. Potential fuel economy improvement is shown by using fuzzy logic, relative to other controllers, which maximize only the efficiency of the engine.","1558-0865","","10.1109/87.998036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=998036","","Fuzzy logic;Vehicles;Internal combustion engines;Energy storage;Power generation;Fuzzy control;Fuzzy sets;Electric motors;Fuzzy systems;Power system modeling","road vehicles;electric motors;internal combustion engines;fuzzy control;fuel optimal control;optimisation","hybrid vehicles;road vehicles;energy storage;fuzzy control;electric motor;internal combustion engine;fuzzy rules;optimization;fuel economy","","328","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We first develop a model for such a transmission scheme and focus particularly on multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Using this method, we analyze the impact of time variation within a transmission block (time variation could arise both from Doppler spread of the channel and from synchronization errors). To mitigate the effects of such time variations, we propose a time-domain approach. We design ICI-mitigating block linear filters, and we examine how they are modified in the context of space-time block-coded transmissions. Our approach reduces to the familiar single-tap frequency-domain equalizer when the channel is block time invariant. Channel estimation in rapidly time-varying scenarios becomes critical, and we propose a scheme for estimating channel parameters varying within a transmission block. Along with the channel estimation scheme, we also examine the issue of pilot tone placement and show that in time-varying channels, it may be better to group pilot tones together into clumps that are equispaced onto the FFT grid; this placement technique is in contrast to the common wisdom for time-invariant channels. Finally, we provide numerical results illustrating the performance of these schemes, both for uncoded and space-time block-coded systems.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2002.803347","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1033676","","Interference;MIMO;OFDM;Time-varying channels;Channel estimation;Frequency synchronization;Time domain analysis;Nonlinear filters;Equalizers;Parameter estimation","OFDM modulation;MIMO systems;time-varying channels;radiofrequency interference;parameter estimation;land mobile radio;time-domain analysis;interference suppression;block codes;equalisers;digital filters","intercarrier interference;MIMO OFDM;multicarrier transmission;time-varying channels;multiple-input multiple output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;transmission block;Doppler spread;synchronization errors;time-domain approach;ICI-mitigating block linear filters;space-time block-coded transmissions;single-tap frequency-domain equalizer;block time invariant channel;channel estimation;rapidly time-varying scenarios;channel parameters;pilot tone placement;FFT grid","","275","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We derive and compare expressions for the asymptotic growth rate of capacity with n antennas for both independent and correlated fading cases; the latter is derived under some assumptions about the scaling of the fading correlation structure. In both cases, the theoretic capacity growth is linear in n but the growth rate is 10-20% smaller in the presence of correlated fading. We analyze our assumption of separable transmit/receive correlations via simulations based on a ray-tracing propagation model.

QoS takes into account not only the average response time, but also the percentile of the response time; and throughput is the rate at which a service can process requests. QoS measures can include the maximum throughput or a function that describes how throughput varies with load intensity. The QoS measure is observed by Web services users.

A premise of our work is that programmers use meaningful names for program items, such as functions, variables, types, classes, and methods. We believe that the application-domain knowledge that programmers process when writing the code is often captured by the mnemonics for identifiers; therefore, the analysis of these mnemonics can help to associate high-level concepts with program concepts and vice-versa. We apply both a probabilistic and a vector space information retrieval model in two case studies to trace C++ source code onto manual pages and Java code to functional requirements.

Eng., Stanford Univ., CA, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","","2002","1","1","46","55","We propose a new method of power control for interference-limited wireless networks with Rayleigh fading of both the desired and interference signals. Our method explicitly takes into account the statistical variation of both the received signal and interference power and optimally allocates power subject to constraints on the probability of fading induced outage for each transmitter/receiver pair. We establish several results for this type of problem. We establish tight bounds that relate the outage probability caused by channel fading to the signal-to-interference margin calculated when the statistical variation of the signal and interference powers is ignored. This allows us to show that well-known methods for allocating power, based on Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue theory, can be used to determine power allocations that are provably close to achieving optimal (i.e., minimal) outage probability. We show that the problems of minimizing the transmitter power subject to constraints on outage probability and minimizing outage probability subject to power constraints can be posed as a geometric program (GP). A GP is a special type of optimization problem that can be transformed to a nonlinear convex optimization problem by a change of variables and therefore solved globally and efficiently by interior-point methods. We also give a fast iterative method for finding the optimal power allocation to minimize the outage probability.","1558-2248","","10.1109/7693.975444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=975444","","Power control;Fading;Rayleigh channels;Probability;Interference constraints;Transmitters;Optimization methods;Wireless networks;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Iterative methods","radiofrequency interference;Rayleigh channels;radio networks;telecommunication control;power control;probability;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;radio transmitters;geometric programming","optimal power control;interference-limited fading wireless channels;outage-probability specifications;interference-limited wireless networks;interference signals;received signal statistical variation;interference power;fading induced outage probability;Rayleigh fading;signal-to-in interference margin;Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue theory;transmitter power minimization;geometric program;nonlinear convex optimization problem;interior-point methods;fast iterative method;optimal power allocation","","417","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The local normal model treats the neighborhood of a pixel as having a normal probability distribution. The normal mixture model considers the observation from each pixel as arising from one of several possible classes such that each class has a normal probability distribution. The linear mixture model considers each observation to be a linear combination of fixed spectra, known as endmembers, that are, or may be, associated with materials in the scene, and the coefficients, interpreted as fractional abundance, are constrained to be nonnegative and sum to one. We show how the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) may be used to derive anomaly detectors for the local normal and global normal mixture models. The anomaly detector applied with the linear mixture approach proceeds by identifying target like endmembers based on properties of the histogram of the abundance estimates and employing a matched filter in the space of abundance estimates. To overcome the limitations of the individual models, we develop a joint decision logic, based on a maximum entropy probability model and the GLRT, that utilizes multiple decision statistics, and we apply this approach using the detection statistics derived from the three clutter models. Examples demonstrate that the joint decision logic can improve detection performance in comparison with the individual anomaly detectors. We also describe the application of linear prediction filters to repeated images of the same area to detect changes that occur within the scene over time.","1558-0792","","10.1109/79.974730","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=974730","","Spectral analysis","spectral analysis;image processing;signal detection;filtering theory;prediction theory;clutter;normal distribution;matched filters;maximum entropy methods;statistical analysis","anomaly detectors;clutter models;local normal model;global normal mixture model;global linear mixture model;pixel;normal probability distribution;observation;fixed spectra;endmembers;coefficients;fractional abundance;generalized likelihood ratio test;GLRT;histogram;abundance estimates;matched filter;joint decision logic;maximum entropy probability model;multiple decision statistics;detection statistics;detection performance;linear prediction filters;image processing;hyperspectral imagery","","379","","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The open-loop DC gain is boosted up by a low frequency dominant pole, which increases the regulator accuracy. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme, a LDR utilizing the new frequency compensation scheme is designed and fabricated using the TSMC 0.35/spl mu/m digital CMOS process. Simulation results show that with output current from 0 /spl mu/A to 100 mA, the bandwidth variation is only 2.3 times and the minimum DC gain is 72 dB.

A rigorous analytic method of incorporating state equality constraints in the Kalman filter is developed. The constraints may be time varying. At each time step the unconstrained Kalman filter solution is projected onto the state constraint surface. This significantly improves the prediction accuracy of the filter.

The ML estimator is optimized in a single step, as opposed to other estimators that are optimized separately in relative time-delay and source location estimations. For the multisource case, we propose and demonstrate an efficient alternating projection procedure based on sequential iterative search on single-source parameters. The proposed algorithm is shown to yield superior performance over other suboptimal techniques, including the wideband MUSIC and the two-step least-squares methods, and is efficient with respect to the derived Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). From the CRB analysis, we find that better source location estimates can be obtained for high-frequency signals than low-frequency signals. In addition, large range estimation error results when the source signal is unknown, but such unknown parameter does not have much impact on angle estimation. In some applications, the locations of some sensors may be unknown and must be estimated. The proposed method is extended to estimate the range from a source to an unknown sensor location. After a number of source-location frames, the location of the uncalibrated sensor can be determined based on a least-squares unknown sensor location estimator.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2002.800420","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1018778","","Maximum likelihood estimation;Wideband;Sensor arrays;Multiple signal classification;Narrowband;Signal processing algorithms;Acoustic sensors;Position measurement;Acoustic arrays;Radar tracking","maximum likelihood estimation;array signal processing;direction-of-arrival estimation;iterative methods;search problems","maximum-likelihood source localization;unknown sensor location estimation;wideband signals;near-field;sensor array;ML estimator;relative time-delay estimations;multisource case;alternating projection procedure;sequential iterative search;single-source parameters;Cramer-Rao bound;CRB;source location estimates;high-frequency signals;low-frequency signals;range estimation error;angle estimation;source-location frames;uncalibrated sensor;least-squares location estimator","","304","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A great deal of effort has been made in recent years to develop objective image quality metrics that correlate with perceived quality measurement. Unfortunately, only limited success has been achieved. In this paper, we provide some insights on why image quality assessment is so difficult by pointing out the weaknesses of the error sensitivity based framework, which has been used by most image quality assessment approaches in the literature. Furthermore, we propose a new philosophy in designing image quality metrics: The main function of the human eyes is to extract structural information from the viewing field, and the human visual system is highly adapted for this purpose. Therefore, a measurement of structural distortion should be a good approximation of perceived image distortion. Based on the new philosophy, we implemented a simple but effective image quality indexing algorithm, which is very promising as shown by our current results.","1520-6149","0-7803-7402-9","10.1109/ICASSP.2002.5745362","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5745362","","Distortion measurement;Distortion;Instruments","","","","287","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The most popular design technique is the Ziegler-Nichols method, which relies solely on parameters obtained from the plant step response. However, besides being suitable only for systems with monotonic step response, the compensated systems whose controllers are tuned in accordance with the Ziegler-Nichols method have generally a step response with a high-percent overshoot. In this paper, tuning methods for proportional-integral (PI) and PID controllers are proposed that, like the Ziegler-Nichols method, need only parameters obtained from the plant step response. The methodology also encompasses the design of PID controllers for plants with underdamped step response and provides the means for a systematic adjustment of the controller gain in order to meet transient performance specifications. In addition, since all the development of the methodology relies solely on concepts introduced in a frequency-domain-based control course, the paper has also a didactic contribution.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2002.804399","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1049598","","Control engineering education;Proportional control;Transient analysis","control engineering education;two-term control;three-term control;control system synthesis;transient analysis","PI controller design;PID controller design;transient performance specification;industrial control systems because;tuning methods;underdamped step response;contribution;frequency-domain-based control course;control simulation","","162","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This problem could be solved choosing a high value for the ac inductors making them expensive and bulky. Moreover the dynamic of the system becomes poor with so high value of inductance. On the contrary to adopt an LCL-filter configuration allows to use reduced values of the inductances (preserving dynamic) and to reduce the switching frequency pollution emitted in the grid. However the stability of the system should be rigorously studied. A poor analysis made on qualitative considerations could lead to excessive damping (unnecessary increase of the losses) or insufficient damping (the system seems to be stable but it is not). In this paper the damping, both passive (based on the use of resistors) and active (based on the modification of the control algorithm), is studied using the z-plane root locus approach and looking to dynamic performances and losses. In fact it is necessary to verify the dynamic effects by the introduction of damping resistors or by the modification of the control algorithm to perform active damping. The analysis is validated both with simulation and experiments.","","0-7803-7262-X","10.1109/PSEC.2002.1022338","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1022338","","Stability;Rectifiers;Damping;Switching frequency;Resistors;Voltage control;Electromagnetic interference;Inductors;Inductance;Pollution","rectifying circuits;damping;filters;stability;root loci;resistors;voltage control;electric current control","stability improvements;LCL-filter based three-phase active rectifier;controllable DC voltage;sinusoidal input currents;high switching frequency ripple;EMI sensitive equipment efficiency reduction;LCL-filter;inductance values reduction;switching frequency pollution reduction;passive damping;active damping;resistors;losses;z-plane root locus;dynamic performances;dynamic effects;voltage oriented control;current controllers;30 kVA","","136","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We designed and tested a novel bioamplifier that uses a MOS-bipolar pseudo-resistor to amplify signals down to the mHz range while rejecting large dc offsets. We derive the theoretical noise-power tradeoff limit - the noise efficiency factor - for this amplifier and demonstrate that our VLSI implementation approaches that limit.

The approach is based on repeated analyses of a circuit with the desired topology; no similarity transformation is needed. Restrictions imposed by the implementation on the coupling coefficients such as signs and orders of magnitudes are straightforwardly handled within this technique. The technique is then used to synthesize and design filters with full or almost full coupling matrices by selecting, among the infinite number of solutions, the matrix that corresponds to the actual implementation. In such cases, analytical techniques and those based on similarity transformations cannot be used since they provide no mechanism to constrain individual coupling coefficients in order to discriminate between two full coupling matrices, which are both solutions to the synthesis problem. Using the technique described in this paper, a filter designer can extract the coupling matrix of a filter of arbitrary order and topology while enforcing relevant constraints. There is no need to master all the different existing similarity-transformation-based techniques and the topologies to which they are applicable. For the first time, detailed investigations of parasitic coupling effects, for either compensation or utilization, are made possible. The method is applied to the synthesis of a variety of filters, some of which are then designed and built and their response measured.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2002.801348","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1022042","","Resonator filters;Coupling circuits;Microwave filters;Filtering theory;Circuit synthesis;Attenuation;Circuit analysis;Circuit topology;Wireless communication","resonator filters;coupled circuits;network topology;adaptive filters;minimisation;circuit optimisation;matrix algebra;band-pass filters;elliptic filters","coupled resonator filters;source/load-multiresonator coupling;adaptive synthesis;circuit topology;coupling coefficients;full coupling matrices;parasitic coupling effects;bandpass filters;dual-mode filters;elliptic filters;group delay;gradient-based minimization technique","","195","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The balance of the capacitor voltages is not possible in all operating conditions when the MPC converter possesses a passive front end. On the other hand, in AC/DC/AC power conversion, the back-to-back connection of a multilevel rectifier with a multilevel inverter allows the balance of the DC-link capacitor voltages and, at the same time, it offers the power-factor-correction capability at the mains AC input. An effective balancing strategy suitable for MPC conversion systems with any number of DC-link capacitors is presented here. The strategy has been carefully studied to optimize the converter efficiency.

Recently, capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs) have emerged as an alternative technology offering advantages such as wide bandwidth, ease of fabricating large arrays, and potential for integration with electronics. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the viability of CMUTs for ultrasound imaging. We present the first pulse-echo phased array B-scan sector images using a 128-element, one-dimensional (1-D) linear CMUT array. We fabricated 64- and 128-element 1-D CMUT arrays with 100% yield and uniform element response across the arrays. These arrays have been operated in immersion with no failure or degradation in performance over the time. For imaging experiments, we built a resolution test phantom roughly mimicking the attenuation properties of soft tissue. We used a PC-based experimental system, including custom-designed electronic circuits to acquire the complete set of 128/spl times/128 RF A-scans from all transmit-receive element combinations. We obtained the pulse-echo frequency response by analyzing the echo signals from wire targets. These echo signals presented an 80% fractional bandwidth around 3 MHz, including the effect of attenuation in the propagating medium. We reconstructed the B-scan images with a sector angle of 90 degrees and an image depth of 210 mm through offline processing by using RF beamforming and synthetic phased array approaches. The measured 6-dB lateral and axial resolutions at 135 mm depth were 0.0144 radians and 0.3 mm, respectively. The electronic noise floor of the image was more than 50 dB below the maximum mainlobe magnitude. We also performed preliminary investigations on the effects of crosstalk among array elements on the image quality. In the near field, some artifacts were observable extending out from the array to a depth of 2 cm. A tail also was observed in the point spread function (PSF) in the axial direction, indicating the existence of crosstalk. The relative amplitude of this tail with respect to the mainlobe was less than -20 dB.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2002.1049742","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1049742","","Ultrasonic transducer arrays;Ultrasonic transducers;Acoustic arrays;Acoustic imaging;Phased arrays;Crosstalk;Bandwidth;Ultrasonic imaging;Attenuation;Radio frequency","ultrasonic transducer arrays;capacitive sensors;micromachining;biological tissues;phantoms;biomedical ultrasonics;biomedical transducers;ultrasonic imaging","capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer;acoustic imaging;one-dimensional linear array;soft tissue;phantom;pulse-echo frequency response;attenuation properties;B-scan image;image reconstruction;A-scan image;RF beamforming;synthetic phased array;electronic noise;crosstalk;point spread function","Adipose Tissue;Algorithms;Artifacts;Computer Simulation;Electric Capacitance;Electrodes;Equipment Design;Image Enhancement;Liver;Miniaturization;Phantoms, Imaging;Quality Control;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Stochastic Processes;Transducers;Ultrasonography","317","","57","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, in contrast to such fields as quantum computing and quantum information theory, it does not inherently depend on the physics associated with quantum mechanics. Consequently, in developing the QSP framework we are free to impose quantum mechanical constraints that we find useful and to avoid those that are not. This framework provides a unifying conceptual structure for a variety of traditional processing techniques and a precise mathematical setting for developing generalizations and extensions of algorithms, leading to a potentially useful paradigm for signal processing with applications in areas including frame theory, quantization and sampling methods, detection, parameter estimation, covariance shaping, and multiuser wireless communication systems.

This study directly compared the electrical characteristics of iridium oxide and titanium nitride by fabricating silicon substrate probes that differed only in the material used to form the electrode. Electrochemical measurements indicated that iridium oxide had lower impedance and a higher charge storage capacity than titanium nitride, suggesting better performance as a stimulating electrode. Direct measurement of the electrode potential in response to a biphasic current pulse confirmed that iridium oxide uses less voltage to transfer the same amount of charge, therefore using less power. The charge injection limit for titanium nitride was 0.87 mC/cm/sup 2/, contradicting other reports estimating that titanium nitride was capable of injecting 22 mC/cm/sup 2/. Iridium oxide charge storage was 4 mC/cm/sup 2/, which is comparable to other published values for iridium oxide.

Simple nonisolated per-module DC-DC converters can be series connected to create a high voltage string connected to a simplified DC-AC inverter. These advantages are available without the cost or efficiency penalties of individual DC-AC grid connected inverters. Buck, boost, buck-boost and Cuk converters are possible cascadable converters. The boost converter is best if a significant step up is required, such as with a short string of 12 PV modules. A string of buck converters requires many more modules, but can always deliver any combination of module power. The buck converter is the most efficient topology for a given cost.

Recently, with the introduction of the new high-speed 802.11a physical layer (PHY), it is even more important to have a well-designed link adaptation scheme work with the 802.11a PHY such that its multiple transmission rates can be exploited. In this paper, we first present a generic method to analyze the goodput performance of an 802.11a system under the distributed coordination function (DCF) and express the expected effective goodput as a closed-form function of the data payload length, the frame retry count, the wireless channel condition, and the selected data transmission rate. Then, based on the theoretical analysis, we propose a novel MPDU (MAC protocol data unit)-based link adaptation scheme for the 802.11a systems. It is a simple table-driven approach and the basic idea is to preestablish a best PHY mode table by applying the dynamic programming technique. The best PHY mode table is indexed by the system status triplet that consists of the data payload length, the wireless channel condition, and the frame retry count. At runtime, a wireless station determines the most appropriate PHY mode for the next transmission attempt by a simple table lookup, using the most up-to-date system status as the index. Our in-depth simulation shows that the proposed MPDU-based link adaptation scheme outperforms the single-mode schemes and the autorate fallback (ARF) scheme-which is used in Lucent Technologies' WaveLAN-II networking devices-significantly in terms of the average goodput, the frame drop rate, and the average number of transmission attempts per data frame delivery.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2002.1175541","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1175541","","Wireless LAN;Physical layer;Data communication;Payloads;Local area networks;Performance analysis;Media Access Protocol;Dynamic programming;Runtime;Table lookup","IEEE standards;access protocols;performance evaluation;dynamic programming;digital simulation;wireless LAN;telecommunication standards","goodput analysis;link adaptation;IEEE 802.11a wireless LAN;data transmission rate;goodput performance;wireless local-area networks;high-speed 802.11a physical layer;multiple transmission rates;distributed coordination function;expected effective goodput;closed-form function;data payload length;frame retry count;wireless channel condition;MAC protocol data unit;table-driven approach;PHY mode table;dynamic programming;wireless station;most up-to-date system status;simulation;MPDU-based link adaptation;single-mode schemes;autorate fallback scheme;average goodput;frame drop rate;transmission attempts per data frame delivery;WLAN","","386","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An intermediate converter can therefore increase efficiency by matching the PV system to the load and by operating the solar cell arrays (SCAs) at their maximum power point. An MP point tracking algorithm is developed using only SCA voltage information thus leading to current sensorless tracking control. The inadequacy of a boost converter for array voltage based MP point control is experimentally verified and an improved converter system is proposed. The proposed converter system results in low ripple content, which improves the array performance and hence a lower value of capacitance is sufficient on the solar array side. Simplified mathematical expressions for a PV source are derived. A signal flow graph is employed for modeling the converter system.

Among the most appealing aspects of this field are the ability to refer it to a well-established theory, and the fact that the proposed algorithms in this field are efficient and practical. Adaptive methods based on anisotropic diffusion (AD), weighted least squares (WLS), and robust estimation (RE) were proposed as iterative locally adaptive machines for noise removal. Tomasi and Manduchi (see Proc. 6th Int. Conf. Computer Vision, New Delhi, India, p.839-46, 1998) proposed an alternative noniterative bilateral filter for removing noise from images. This filter was shown to give similar and possibly better results to the ones obtained by iterative approaches. However, the bilateral filter was proposed as an intuitive tool without theoretical connection to the classical approaches. We propose such a bridge, and show that the bilateral filter also emerges from the Bayesian approach, as a single iteration of some well-known iterative algorithm. Based on this observation, we also show how the bilateral filter can be improved and extended to treat more general reconstruction problems.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2002.801126","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1042377","","Filters;Signal processing algorithms;Iterative algorithms;Iterative methods;Additive noise;Signal processing;Adaptive signal processing;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Least squares approximation;Noise robustness","filtering theory;Bayes methods;least squares approximations;noise;iterative methods;digital filters;image restoration","additive noise removal;signal processing;adaptive methods;weighted least squares;robust estimation;iterative locally adaptive machines;noniterative bilateral filter;Bayesian approach;iterative algorithm;reconstruction problems;anisotropic diffusion;Jacobi algorithm;diagonal normalized steepest descent;digital total-variation filter;2D signals;piecewise constant test image;noise suppression","","473","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

All the strategies adopt a binary search of the threshold in the whole training set starting from the local threshold computed at a node.

The second strategy also uses the algorithm of C4.5, but adopts a counting sort method.

The scheme operates as a block transmission system in which vectors of symbols are encoded and modulated through a linear mapping operating jointly in the space and time dimension. The specific designs target minimization of the symbol mean square error and the approximate maximization of the minimum distance between symbol hypotheses, under average and peak power constraints. The solutions are shown to convert the MIMO channel with memory into a set of parallel flat fading subchannels, regardless of the design criterion, while appropriate power/bits loading on the subchannels is the specific signature of the different designs.

We study adapting the user's transmission rate and power based on the channel state information as well as the buffer occupancy; the objectives are to regulate both the long-term average transmission power and the average buffer delay incurred by the traffic. Two models for this situation are discussed; one corresponding to fixed-length/variable-rate codewords and one corresponding to variable-length codewords. The tradeoff between the average delay and the average transmission power required for reliable communication is analyzed. A dynamic programming formulation is given to find all Pareto optimal power/delay operating points. We then quantify the behavior of this tradeoff in the regime of asymptotically large delay. In this regime, we characterize simple buffer control policies which exhibit optimal characteristics.

Typically, human faces are very similar in structure with minor differences from person to person. They are actually within one class of ""human face"". Furthermore, lighting conditions change, while facial expressions and pose variations further complicate the face recognition task as one of the difficult problems in pattern analysis. This paper proposes a novel concept: namely, that faces can be recognized using a line edge map (LEM). The LEM, a compact face feature, is generated for face coding and recognition. A thorough investigation of the proposed concept is conducted which covers all aspects of human face recognition, i.e. face recognition under (1) controlled/ideal conditions and size variations, (2) varying lighting conditions, (3) varying facial expressions, and (4) varying pose. The system performance is also compared with the eigenface method, one of the best face recognition techniques, and with reported experimental results of other methods. A face pre-filtering technique is proposed to speed up the search process. It is a very encouraging to find that the proposed face recognition technique has performed better than the eigenface method in most of the comparison experiments. This research demonstrates that the LEM, together with the proposed generic line-segment Hausdorff distance measure, provides a new method for face coding and recognition.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2002.1008383","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1008383","","Face recognition;Humans;Image sequences;Pattern recognition;Lighting control;Access control;Biometrics;Biomedical monitoring;Law enforcement;Pattern analysis","face recognition;edge detection;lighting;image coding","face recognition;line edge map;face coding;pattern recognition;human faces;lighting conditions;facial expressions;pose variations;controlled conditions;ideal conditions;size variation;system performance;eigenface method;face pre-filtering technique;search process speedup;line-segment Hausdorff distance measure;structural information","","285","","49","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Current humanoid robots, however, lack in adaptability, agility, or high-mobility enough to meet the expectations. In order to enhance high-mobility, the humanoid motion should be generated in real-time in accordance with the dynamics, which commonly requires a large amount of computation and has not been implemented so far. We have developed a real-time motion generation method that controls the center of gravity (COG) by indirect manipulation of the zero moment point (ZMP). The real-time response of the method provides humanoid robots with high-mobility. In the paper, the algorithm is presented. It consists of four parts, namely, the referential ZMP planning, the ZMP manipulation, the COG velocity decomposition to joint angles, and local control of joint angles. An advantage of the algorithm lies in its applicability to humanoids with a lot of degrees of freedom.

These results are derived using a full nonlinear analysis of the VCO in the feedback loop and cannot be predicted using traditional linear analyses or the phase noise analysis of open-loop oscillators. The computed spectrum matches well with measured results; specifically, the shape of the output spectrum matches very well with measured PLL output spectra reported in the literature for different kinds of loop filters and phase detectors.

The feasibility of the proposed filter has been tested in the laboratory under worst-case measurement and network conditions, which might occur in a typical power system. Also, the proof of the stability for the proposed filter has been discussed for a single sinusoid.

The microelectronics packaging infrastructure provides high-temperature ceramic materials, fabrication tools, and well-developed processing techniques that have the potential for applicability in high-temperature sensing. Based on this infrastructure, a completely passive ceramic pressure sensor that uses a wireless telemetry scheme has been developed. The passive nature of the telemetry removes the need for electronics, power supplies, or contacts to withstand the high-temperature environment. The sensor contains a passive LC resonator comprised of a movable diaphragm capacitor and a fixed inductor, thereby causing the sensor resonant frequency to be pressure-dependent. Data is retrieved with an external loop antenna. The sensor has been fabricated and characterized and was compared with an electromechanical model. It was operated up to 400/spl deg/C in a pressure range from 0 to 7 Bar. The average sensitivity and accuracy of three typical sensors are: -141 kHz Bar/sup -1/ and 24 mbar, respectively.","1941-0158","","10.1109/JMEMS.2002.800939","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1022845","","Wireless sensor networks;Ceramics;Electromechanical sensors;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Information retrieval;Telemetry;Capacitive sensors;Turbines;Engines;Compressors","pressure sensors;microsensors;capacitive sensors;ceramics;radiotelemetry;hybrid integrated circuits;high-temperature techniques","wireless micromachined ceramic pressure sensor;high-temperature applications;pressure sensing;turbine engines;compressors;data retrieval methods;microelectronics packaging infrastructure;high-temperature ceramic materials;passive ceramic pressure sensor;wireless telemetry scheme;passive LC resonator;movable diaphragm capacitor;fixed inductor;sensor resonant frequency pressure dependence;external loop antenna;electromechanical model;average sensitivity;accuracy;low-temperature cofireable ceramic;screen printing;capacitive sensor;LTCC fabrication technology;ceramic green tape;0 to 7 bar;400 C","","216","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By contrast, designing objective No-Reference (NR) quality measurement algorithms is a very difficult task. Currently, NR quality assessment is feasible only when prior knowledge about the types of image distortion is available. This research aims to develop NR quality measurement algorithms for JPEG compressed images. First, we established a JPEG image database and subjective experiments were conducted on the database. We show that Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), which requires the reference images, is a poor indicator of subjective quality. Therefore, tuning an NR measurement model towards PSNR is not an appropriate approach in designing NR quality metrics. Furthermore, we propose a computational and memory efficient NR quality assessment model for JPEG images. Subjective test results are used to train the model, which achieves good quality prediction performance.","1522-4880","0-7803-7622-6","10.1109/ICIP.2002.1038064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1038064","","Quality assessment;Transform coding;Image coding;PSNR;Distortion measurement;Image databases;Humans;Algorithm design and analysis;Testing;Predictive models","image coding;data compression;prediction theory;visual databases","no-reference perceptual quality assessment;JPEG compressed images;JPEG image database;memory efficient model;prediction performance","","335","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Analysis of the inactivation kinetics for various bacteria seeded in (or on) various media and exposed to the plasma generated by these devices, showed that three types of survivor curves exist, depending on the type of micro-organism, the type of medium, and the type of exposure (direct versus remote).

The system is composed of planar feed antennas (tapered-slot antennas), which are positioned around a homogeneous spherical Teflon lens. Beam scanning can be achieved by switching between the antenna elements. The spherical-lens system is analyzed through a combined ray-optics/diffraction method. It is found that a maximum efficiency of 50%-55% can be achieved using Teflon, Rexolite, or quartz lenses. The efficiency includes taper, spillover, and reflection loss. Calculations also indicate that the maximum lens diameter is 30-40 /spl lambda//sub 0/, which results in a maximum directivity of 39.5-42 dB. Measurements done on a single-element feed and a 5-cm Teflon lens agree very well with theory and result in a 3-dB beamwidth of 5.5/spl deg/ and better than -20-dB sidelobe levels at 77 GHz. Absolute gain measurements show a system efficiency of 46%-48% (including dielectric loss). A 23- and 33-element antenna array with a scan angle of /spl plusmn/90/spl deg/ and a -3.5- and -6-dB crossover, respectively, in the far-field patterns was also demonstrated. The 23-element array resulted in virtually no gain loss over the entire 90/spl deg/ scan angle.

The study addresses device count, DC filter ratings, restrictions on voltage control, active power transfer through the DC link, and balancing of DC-link voltages. Emphasis is placed on capacitor sizing because of its impact on the cost and size of the FACTS controller. A method for the dimensioning the DC capacitor filter is presented. It is found that the chain converter is attractive for the implementation of a static compensator or a static synchronous series compensator.

The DC links of the full bridges are supplied by individual DC-DC isolation stages which are arranged in parallel concerning the dc input of the. total system. Therefore, all switching cells of the proposed converter can be equipped with modern low-voltage high-current power MOSFETs, which results in an improved efficiency as compared to conventional isolated DC-AC converters. Furthermore, the cells are operated in an interleaved pulsewidth-modulation mode which, in connection with the low voltage level of each cell, significantly reduces the filtering effort on the AC output of the overall system. The paper describes the operating principle, analyzes the fundamental relationships which are relevant for component selection, and presents a specific circuit design. Finally, measurements taken from a 2-kW laboratory model are presented.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2002.803212","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1036799","","Renewable energy resources;Switching converters;Distributed power generation;Power generation;Solar power generation;Solar energy;Power systems;Supercapacitors;Batteries;Energy storage","DC-AC power convertors;PWM power convertors;invertors;power MOSFET;photovoltaic power systems","multicell DC-AC converter;renewable energy systems;distributed energy generation systems;solar power systems;fuel-cell power systems;supercapacitor;battery energy storage;isolated multicell topology;total AC output;interleaved pulsewidth modulation;multicell converter;series connection;low-voltage high-current power MOSFETs;series-resonant topology;DC-AC converter;2 kW","","94","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The LEACH protocol presented by Heinzelman et al. (2000) is an elegant solution where clusters are formed to fuse data before transmitting to the base station. In this paper, we present an improved scheme, called PEGASIS (power-efficient gathering in sensor information systems), which is a near-optimal chain-based protocol that minimizes energy. In PEGASIS, each node communicates only with a close neighbor and takes turns transmitting to the base station, thus reducing the amount of energy spent per round. Simulation results show that PEGASIS performs better than LEACH. For many applications, in addition to minimizing energy, it is also important to consider the delay incurred in gathering sensed data. We capture this with the energy /spl times/ delay metric and present schemes that attempt to balance the energy and delay cost for data gathering from sensor networks. We present two new schemes to minimize energy /spl times/ delay using CDMA and non-CDMA sensor nodes. We compared the performance of direct, LEACH, and our schemes with respect to energy /spl times/ delay using extensive simulations for different network sizes. Results show that our schemes perform 80 or more times better than the direct scheme and also outperform the LEACH protocol.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2002.1036066","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1036066","","Protocols;Base stations;Delay;Clustering algorithms;Energy efficiency;Fuses;Sensor systems;Information systems;Energy capture;Costs","data acquisition;code division multiple access;wireless LAN;protocols;delays","wireless sensor networks;data gathering protocols;energy-efficient operation;greedy algorithms;performance evaluation;LEACH;PEGASIS;CDMA;energy metrics;delay;parallel communications","","708","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on a simple model and the discrete wavelet transform, three parameters related to the PT were measured, namely, the average and standard deviation of transition duration and the occurrence of abnormal successive transitions (number of attempts to have a successful transition). The comparison between two groups of elderly subjects (with high and low fall-risk) showed that the computed parameters were significantly correlated with the falling risk as determined by the record of falls during the previous year, balance and gait disorders (Tinetti score), visual disorders, and cognitive and depressive disorders (p < 0.01).

However, it imposes technical challenges in that a write should be preceded by an erase operation, and that this erase operation can be performed only in a unit much larger than the write unit. To address these technical hurdles, an intermediate software layer called a flash translation layer (FTL) is generally employed to redirect logical addresses from the host system to physical addresses in flash memory. Previous approaches have performed this address translation at the granularity of either a write unit (page) or an erase unit (block). We propose a novel FTL design that combines the two different granularities in address translation. This is motivated by the idea that coarse grain address translation lowers the resources required to maintain translation information, which is crucial in mobile consumer products for cost and power consumption reasons, while fine grain address translation is efficient in handling small size writes. Performance evaluation based on trace-driven simulation shows that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms previously proposed approaches.","1558-4127","","10.1109/TCE.2002.1010143","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1010143","","Flash memory;Electric shock;Energy consumption;Hard disks;Nonvolatile memory;Mobile computing;Personal digital assistants;Power engineering computing;Consumer products;Costs","flash memories;power consumption;storage media;storage management","flash translation layer;CompactFlash systems;flash memory management;nonvolatile storage;mobile consumer electronics;power consumption;shock resistance;write operation;erase operation;erase unit;write unit;logical addresses;physical addresses;address translation","","406","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When compared with other sources of variation in face images, appearance variation due to aging displays some unique characteristics. Changes in facial appearance due to aging can even affect discriminatory facial features, resulting in deterioration of the ability of humans and machines to identify aged individuals. We describe how the effects of aging on facial appearance can be explained using learned age transformations and present experimental results to show that reasonably accurate estimates of age can be made for unseen images. We also show that we can improve our results by taking into account the fact that different individuals age in different ways and by considering the effect of lifestyle. Our proposed framework can be used for simulating aging effects on new face images in order to predict how an individual might look like in the future or how he/she used to look in the past. The methodology presented has also been used for designing a face recognition system, robust to aging variation. In this context, the perceived age of the subjects in the training and test images is normalized before the training and classification procedure so that aging variation is eliminated. Experimental results demonstrate that, when age normalization is used, the performance of our face recognition system can be improved.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.993553","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=993553","","Aging","face recognition;statistical analysis","automatic simulation;aging effects;face images;facial appearance;aging variation;health;gender;lifestyle;discriminatory facial features;learned age transformations;face recognition system;perceived age;age normalization;statistical face models","","490","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A single estimator, in the form of a Kalman filter, processes the available positioning information from all the members of the team and produces a pose estimate for every one of them. The equations for this centralized estimator can be written in a decentralized form, therefore allowing this single Kalman filter to be decomposed into a number of smaller communicating filters. Each of these filters processes the sensor data collected by its host robot. Exchange of information between the individual filters is necessary only when two robots detect each other and measure their relative pose. The resulting decentralized estimation schema, which we call collective localization, constitutes a unique means for fusing measurements collected from a variety of sensors with minimal communication and processing requirements.

The PD process is modeled as a network of activities that exchange deliverables. Each activity has an uncertain duration and cost, an improvement curve, and risks of rework based on changes in its inputs. A work policy governs the timing of activity execution and deliverable exchange (and thus the amount of activity concurrency). The model is analyzed via simulation, which outputs sample cost and schedule outcome distributions. Varying the process architecture input varies the output distributions. Each distribution is used with a target and an impact function to determine a risk factor. Alternative process architectures are compared, revealing opportunities to trade cost and schedule risk. Example results and applications are shown for an industrial process, the preliminary design of an uninhabited combat aerial vehicle. The model yields and reinforces several managerial insights, including: how rework cascades through a PD process, trading off cost and schedule risk, interface criticality, and occasions for iterative overlapping.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2002.806709","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176870","","Product development;Research and development management;Risk analysis;Economics","product development;research and development management;risk management;costing;economics","product development;competitive leverage;development processes improvement;improvement curve;risks;process architecture input;uninhabited combat aerial vehicle;schedule risk;development costs;interface criticality","","258","","85","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then the second-order analysis is extended to a third-order PLL with inherent feedback/sampling delay. The sensitivity study clearly illustrates how to select design parameters to obtain minimum output jitter. To verify the analysis experimentally, a digitally tunable PLL architecture is designed and fabricated that allows independent adjustment of loop parameters.

The approach is based on the investigation of the statistical properties of the multipath profiles measured in different rooms over a finely spaced measurement grid. The analysis leads to the formulation of a stochastic tapped-delay-line (STDL) model of the UWB indoor channel. The averaged power delay profile can be well-modeled by a single exponential decay with a statistically distributed decay constant. The small-scale statistics of path energy gains follow Gamma distributions whose parameters m are truncated Gaussian variables with mean values and standard deviations decreasing with delay. The total received energy experiences a lognormal shadowing around the mean energy given by the path-loss power law. We also find that the correlation between multipath components is negligible.

This resonant gate driver recycles the energy stored in the gate capacitance to reduce the CV/sup 2/f losses associated with a conventional gate driver. Reducing the CV/sup 2/f losses reduces the power consumption and hence the subsequent power dissipation in the resonant gate driver. Less power dissipation enables the driver to operate to higher frequencies. In addition, this topology allows the resonant gate driver to drive the MOSFET gate with a much higher peak to peak voltage swing than it is supplied with and to drive the gate negative in its off cycle. The resonant gate driver can drive the gate with a variable frequency and duty cycle, and very fast switching of the power MOSFET is obtained. An introduction into the low loss capacitance driver circuit topology (patent pending) is presented.

These procedures could be implemented on the structure of a wind turbine simulator during studies concerning stand-alone or hybrid wind systems. The evolution of a horizontal wind speed has been synthesized taking into account two components. The medium- and long-term component is described by a power spectrum associated to a specific site. The turbulence component is assumed to be dependent on the medium- and long-term wind speed evolution. It is considered as a nonstationary process.

"Double-folded monopole antenna using parallel line or coaxial cable","T. Tsukiji; Y. Kumon; M. Yamasaki","Dept. of Electron. & Comput. Sci., Fukuoka Univ., Japan; NA; NA","IEE Proceedings - Microwaves, Antennas and Propagation","","2002","149","1","17","22","It has been shown that loading a certain reactance component at the feeding point of an antenna is useful in reducing antenna size. When a parallel transmission line with a short-circuited end is loaded onto a monopole antenna, we can obtain a small antenna called a parallel line loaded monopole antenna. However, a small antenna usually has low input resistance and low actual gain. The approach outlined is to increase the actual gain of the small loading antenna and utilise knowledge of a folded monopole antenna, which has a very high impedance value. A small folded monopole antenna called the double folded monopole antenna (DFMA) with high resistance and high actual gain can then be realised. An explanation of the operational principles of the DFMA is provided and the characteristics of small antenna design discussed. A coaxial cable is also used as the loading element for the loading antenna. It is proposed that a coaxial cable DFMA can be realised by replacing the parallel transmission line loading with coaxial cable transmission line loading. The advantage of the coaxial cable DFMA is that it has a small cross-sectional area, since the coaxial cable loading is embedded within the cylindrical antenna element. The results of actual testing of the coaxial cable DFMA are presented. All other results are provided by computer simulation using the method of moments, since the results are assumed to be similar to those recorded from practical experimentation.","1350-2417","","10.1049/ip-map:20020181","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=999096","","","monopole antennas;coaxial cables;transmission lines;electric reactance;load (electric);method of moments;electric resistance;antenna testing;antenna radiation patterns","double-folded monopole antenna;reactance component loading;feeding point;antenna size reduction;short-circuited end;MoM;radiation characteristics;parallel line loaded monopole antenna;small antenna;low input resistance;gain;folded monopole antenna;impedance;double folded monopole antenna;resistance;DFMA;small antenna design;loading element;parallel transmission line loading;coaxial cable transmission line loading;coaxial cable DFMA;small cross-sectional area;cylindrical antenna element;antenna testing results;computer simulation;method of moments","","11","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals"

These developments began in 1964, when Heilmeier of RCA Laboratories discovered the guest-host mode and the dynamic-scattering mode. He thought a wall-sized flat-panel color TV was just around the corner From that point on, twisted-nematic (TN) mode, super TN mode, amorphous-Si field-effect transistor and room-temperature liquid crystals were developed. In the beginning, liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) were limited to niche applications such as small-size displays for digital watches, pocket calculators, and small handheld devices. That all changed with the development of the notebook computer industry. In 1988, Washizuka et al. of Sharp Corporation demonstrated an active-matrix full-color full-motion 14-in display using a thin-film-transistor array. The electronics industries now recognized that Heilmeier's 25-year dream of a wall-hanging television had become reality. LCDs could be used to replace existing cathode ray tubes. Through the cooperation and competition of many electronics giants, the LCD industry was firmly established.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2002.1002521","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1002521","","History;Liquid crystal displays;Liquid crystals;TV;Computer displays;Electronics industry;Modems;Laboratories;FETs;Application software","history;liquid crystal displays;thin film transistors;nematic liquid crystals;flat panel displays;colour displays;television receivers","history;liquid-crystal displays;guest-host mode;dynamic-scattering mode;flat-panel displays;twisted-nematic mode;super TN mode;room-temperature liquid crystals;active-matrix full-color full-motion display;thin-film-transistor array;wall-hanging television","","171","","119","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, it describes the sensorless vector control method, which consists of the high and middle speed range algorithm and the low speed range algorithms. The V/f control, which realizes a low cost and simple design, is advantageous in the middle to high-speed range. Its torque response depends on the electrical time constant of the motor and adjustments of the control parameters are not needed (as in case of sensorless vector control). The sensorless vector control performs very well in the low speed range including the zero speed. However, it requires a high-speed position estimator to constrain the current regulator and the speed regulator design. The V/f control is the best choice for simple variable speed applications like fans, pumps and it is more effective in the high-speed range. The sensorless control is the best choice for simple tension and low speed control applications like cranes and high performance drives.","","0-7803-7156-9","10.1109/PCC.2002.998163","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=998163","","Sensorless control;Machine vector control;Regulators;Permanent magnet motors;Costs;Synchronous motors;Torque control;Fans;Velocity control;Cranes","permanent magnet motors;angular velocity control;synchronous motors;machine vector control;voltage control;frequency control","permanent magnet synchronous motor;position-sensorless vector control;V/f control;PMSM;stabilization;high efficiency control;torque response;electrical time constant;stability analysis;stabilization control;current regulator;speed regulator design;fans;pumps;cranes;high performance drives","","47","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Stretching of sequences in time is allowed, as well as global translation of the sequences in space. Efficient approximate algorithms that compute these similarity measures are also provided.

Furthermore, in order to evaluate propagation characteristics of not only bound modes but leaky modes in HFs, an anisotropic perfectly matched layer is also employed as a boundary condition at computational window edges. It is confirmed from numerical results that the propagation loss increases rapidly with increasing wavelength, especially for HFs with one ring of smaller air holes, and that the propagation loss is drastically reduced by adding one more ring of air holes to the cladding region.","1558-1713","","10.1109/JQE.2002.1017609","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1017609","","Finite element methods;Propagation losses;Photonic crystal fibers;Optical waveguides;Optical propagation;Holey fibers;Image analysis;Finite difference methods;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Perfectly matched layers","photonic band gap;optical fibre theory;finite element analysis;boundary-value problems;light propagation;optical fibre losses;optical arrays","photonic crystal fibers;full-vectorial imaginary-distance beam propagation method;finite element scheme;leakage;air hole arrays;photonic-crystal holey fibers;arbitrarily shaped air holes;curvilinear edge/nodal hybrid element;bound modes;leaky modes;anisotropic perfectly matched layer;boundary condition;computational window edges;numerical results;propagation loss;cladding region","","371","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These channels model the effects of inter-symbol interference (ISI), co-channel interference (CCI), and noise. A low-order autoregressive model approximates the MIMO channel variation and facilitates tracking via a Kalman filter. Hard decisions to aid Kalman tracking come from a MIMO finite-length minimum-mean-squared-error decision-feedback equalizer (MMSE-DFE), which performs the equalization task. Since the optimum DFE for a wide range of channels produces decisions with a delay /spl Delta/ > 0, the Kalman filter tracks the channel with a delay. A channel prediction module bridges the time gap between the channel estimates produced by the Kalman filter and those needed for the DFE adaptation. The proposed algorithm offers good tracking behavior for multiuser fading ISI channels at the expense of higher complexity than conventional adaptive algorithms. Applications include synchronous multiuser detection of independent transmitters, as well as coordinated transmission through many transmitter/receiver antennas, for increased data rate.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.995063","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=995063","","Fading;Decision feedback equalizers;MIMO;Intersymbol interference;Delay;Transmitters;Frequency;Interchannel interference;Radiofrequency interference;Kalman filters","MIMO systems;fading channels;radio tracking;tracking filters;adaptive equalisers;time-varying channels;intersymbol interference;cochannel interference;decision feedback equalisers;autoregressive processes;prediction theory;delays;multiuser channels;receiving antennas;transmitting antennas","MIMO fading channel tracking;channel equalization;multi-input multi-output frequency-selective channels;time-varying channels;Kalman estimation;intersymbol interference;co-channel interference;adaptive systems;CCI;noise;low-order autoregressive model;MIMO channel variation;Kalman filter;hard decisions;finite-length MMSE-DFE;minimum-mean-squared-error;decision-feedback equalizer;delay;channel prediction module;channel estimates;multiuser fading ISI channels;adaptive algorithms;synchronous multiuser detection;transmitters;coordinated transmission;transmitter/receiver antennas;data rate","","319","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Several electric power companies are now forecasting load power based on conventional methods. However, since the relationship between load power and factors influencing load power is nonlinear, it is difficult to identify its nonlinearity by using conventional methods. Most of papers deal with 24-hour-ahead load forecasting or next day peak load forecasting. These methods forecast the demand power by using forecasted temperature as forecast information. But, when the temperature curves changes rapidly on the forecast day, load power changes greatly and forecast error would going to increase. In conventional methods neural networks uses all similar day's data to learn the trend of similarity. However, learning of all similar day's data is very complex, and it does not suit learning of neural network. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the neural network structure and learning time. To overcome these problems, we propose a one-hour-ahead load forecasting method using the correction of similar day data. In the proposed prediction method, the forecasted load power is obtained by adding a correction to the selected similar day data.","1558-0679","","10.1109/59.982201","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=982201","","Load forecasting;Neural networks;Demand forecasting;Weather forecasting;Temperature;Power system planning;Prediction methods;Power engineering and energy;Recurrent neural networks;Power system modeling","load forecasting;recurrent neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);power system analysis computing;power system planning","one-hour-ahead load forecasting;power system planning;power system operation;electric power companies;load power;nonlinearity;24-hour-ahead load forecasting;next day peak load forecasting;forecasted temperature;forecast information;neural networks;on-line learning;similar day data correction;recurrent neural network","","204","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the increase in power demand and limited power sources has caused the system to operate at its maximum capacity. Therefore, a study that is able to determine the maximum capacity limit before voltage collapse must be carried out so that necessary precaution can be taken to avoid system capacity violation. This paper presents a novel fast voltage stability index (FVSI) simplified from a pre-developed voltage stability index referred to a line initiated from the voltage quadratic equation at the sending end of a representation of a 2-bus system. The line index in the interconnected system in which the value that is closed to 1.00 indicates that the line has reached its instability limit which could cause sudden voltage drop to the corresponding bus caused by the reactive load variation. The formulated index was tested on the IEEE reliability test system in order to verify the performance of the proposed indicator. Results showed that the proposed technique is indicative in predicting the occurrence of system collapse and hence necessary action can be taken to avoid such incident.","","0-7803-7565-3","10.1109/SCORED.2002.1033108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1033108","","Voltage;Stability analysis;Power transmission;Power system stability;System testing;Couplings;Power system analysis computing;Power demand;Equations;Interconnected systems","power transmission control;power system dynamic stability;power system analysis computing;power system interconnection;control system analysis computing","power transmission system;voltage stability analysis;fast voltage stability index;control simulation;computer simulation;voltage collapse;line index;maximum permissible load","","89","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is the problem of planning a path through a continuous domain Rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) are a recently developed representation on which fast continuous domain path planners can be based. In this work, we build a path planning system based on RRTs that interleaves planning and execution, first evaluating it in simulation and then applying it to physical robots. Our planning algorithm, ERRT (execution extended RRT), introduces two novel extensions of previous RRT work, the waypoint cache and adaptive cost penalty search, which improve replanning efficiency and the quality of generated paths. ERRT is successfully applied to a real-time multi-robot system. Results demonstrate that ERRT is significantly more efficient for replanning than a basic RRT planner, performing competitively with or better than existing heuristic and reactive real-time path planning approaches. ERRT is a significant step forward with the potential for making path planning common on real robots, even in challenging continuous, highly dynamic domains.","","0-7803-7398-7","10.1109/IRDS.2002.1041624","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1041624","","Path planning;Navigation;Mobile robots;Computer science;Costs;Real time systems;Multirobot systems;Time factors;State-space methods;Explosions","mobile robots;path planning;real-time systems;randomised algorithms","real-time randomized path planning;robot navigation;mobile robots;constraints;obstacles;robot capabilities;path planning;rapidly-exploring random trees;execution extended RRT;ERRT;fast continuous domain path planners;waypoint cache;adaptive cost penalty search;replanning efficiency;generated path quality;real-time multirobot system","","168","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A nonlinear kNN-classifier is used, instead of the linear Mahalanobis distance, to find optimal displacements for landmarks. For each of the landmarks that describe the shape, at each resolution level taken into account during the segmentation optimization procedure, a distinct set of optimal features is determined. The selection of features is automatic, using the training images and sequential feature forward and backward selection. The new approach is tested on synthetic data and in four medical segmentation tasks: segmenting the right and left lung fields in a database of 230 chest radiographs, and segmenting the cerebellum and corpus callosum in a database of 90 slices from MRI brain images. In all cases, the new method produces significantly better results in terms of an overlap error measure (p<0.001 using a paired T-test) than the original active shape model scheme.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2002.803121","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1076037","","Active shape model;Image segmentation;Image databases;Spatial databases;Medical tests;Biomedical imaging;Lungs;Radiography;Magnetic resonance imaging;Brain","lung;diagnostic radiography;biomedical MRI;image segmentation;medical image processing;optimisation;image classification","model-based segmentation;active shape model segmentation;optimal features;nonlinear kNN-classifier;automatic features selection;medical diagnostic imaging;synthetic data;medical segmentation tasks;lung fields;chest radiographs;overlap error measure;cerebellum;corpus callosum;paired T-test;MRI brain images","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Algorithms;Cerebellum;Computer Simulation;Corpus Callosum;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Lung;Middle Aged;Models, Biological;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Quality Control;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","338","","42","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These control schemes can be extensively applied to the operation of a five-phase induction motor using a fully digital implementation. Vector control of the five-phase induction motor not only achieves high drive performance, but also generates the desired nearly rectangular current waveforms and flux profile in the air-gap resulting in an improvement in air gap flux density and an increase of 10% in output torque. The DTC method has additional advantages when applied to multiphase, in this case a five-phase, induction motor. The five-phase inverter provides 32 space voltage vectors in comparison to 8 space voltage vectors provided by the three-phase inverter. Therefore, a more elaborate flux and torque control algorithm for the five-phase induction motor can be employed. Direct torque control of the five-phase induction motor reduces the amplitude of the ripples of both the stator flux and the torque, resulting in a more precise flux and torque control. A 32-b floating-point TMS320C32 digital signal processor (DSP) enables these two sophisticated control techniques to be conveniently implemented with high control precision. Experimental results show that an ideal control capability is obtained for both control methods when applied to the five-phase induction motor and further validates theoretical analysis.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2002.800983","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1016801","","Induction motor drives;Control systems;Induction motors;Torque control;Machine vector control;Inverters;Voltage;Induction generators;Air gaps;Signal processing algorithms","induction motor drives;machine vector control;torque control;digital control;digital signal processing chips;magnetic flux;invertors;magnetic variables control","five-phase induction motor drives;DSP-based control system;direct torque control;vector control;third harmonic currents;rectangular flux distribution;ripples amplitude reduction;floating-point TMS320C32 digital signal processor;high drive performance;nearly rectangular current waveforms;flux profile;air-gap;air gap flux density","","173","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method provides greater accuracy and flexibility in capturing texture information, while its simplified form has a close resemblance with the existing methods which uses energy distribution in the frequency domain to identify textures.

Our main contribution is the characterization of a class of systems for which IDA-PBC yields a smooth asymptotically stabilizing controller with a guaranteed domain of attraction. The class is given in terms of solvability of certain partial differential equations. One important feature of IDA-PBC, stemming from its Hamiltonian formulation, is that it provides new degrees of freedom for the solution of these equations. Using this additional freedom, we are able to show that the method of ""controlled Lagrangians""-in its original formulation-may be viewed as a special case of our approach. As illustrations we design asymptotically stabilizing IDA-PBCs for the classical ball and beam system and a novel inertia wheel pendulum.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2002.800770","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1024334","","Mechanical systems;Damping;Control systems;Shape control;Nonlinear control systems;Lagrangian functions;Equations;Wheels;Design methodology;Potential energy","damping;nonlinear control systems;asymptotic stability;partial differential equations;control system synthesis","underactuated mechanical systems;interconnection and damping assignment;stabilization;passivity-based control;potential energy;kinetic energy;asymptotically stabilizing controller;guaranteed domain of attraction;partial differential equations;solvability;Hamiltonian formulation;degrees of freedom;classical ball and beam system;inertia wheel pendulum","","477","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These problems are solved via the notions of generalized quadratic stability and generalized quadratic stabilization, respectively.

The receiver integrates an input amplifier for 10-Gb/s data, clock and data recovery circuit (CDR), 1:16 demultiplexer, and drivers for low-voltage differential signal (LVDS) outputs. An on-chip LC-type voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) is employed by both the transmitter and receiver. The chipset operates at multiple data rates (9.95-10.71 Gb/s) with functionality compatible with the multisource agreement (MSA) for 10-Gb transponders. Both chips demonstrate SONET-compliant jitter characteristics. The transmitter 10.66-GHz output clock jitter is 0.065 UI/sub pp/ (unit interval, peak-to-peak) over a 50-kHz-80-MHz bandwidth. The receiver jitter tolerance is more than 0.4 UI/sub pp/ at high frequencies (4-80 MHz). A high level of integration and low-power consumption is achieved by using a standard CMOS process.

The white light color accuracy required in the general illumination market is a challenge for LEDs. The variation in lumen output and wavelength for nominally identical LEDs and the change in these parameters with temperature and time result in an unacceptably high variability in the color point of white light from RGB-LEDs.

It is often obtained by filtering the output of a 2-DOF rate gyro mounted on the inner gimbal of the seeker. This paper describes the modeling of an imaging seeker and the formulation of an extended Kalman filter (EKF) for the estimation of LOS rate from measurements of relative angular displacement between seeker gimbals and a low-cost strapdown inertial unit. The approach aims at circumventing the need for the rate gyro on the seeker. A linearizing feedback control law for decoupling missile motion from that of the seeker is proposed based on the filter model and its estimates. Additionally, the control law uses visual information from the image sequence for target tracking. Seeker dynamics and control are then integrated into a dynamic model of a cruciform missile equipped with canards and rollerons and guided by proportional navigation in 3D interception tasks. Monte Carlo simulation is employed to evaluate the overall system accuracy subject to different initial conditions and the impact of rolling motion during high-g maneuvers on miss distance. Initial engagement geometry and roll-rate damping at high incidence angles have significant effect.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2002.1014675","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1014675","","Missiles;Navigation;Accelerometers;Acceleration;Filtering;Displacement measurement;Feedback control;Filters;Motion estimation;Image sequences","linearisation techniques;imaging;missile guidance;Kalman filters;filtering theory;feedback;Monte Carlo methods","line-of-sight rate estimation;linearizing control;imaging seeker;tactical missile;proportional navigation;acceleration commands;LOS rate;filtering;2-DOF rate gyro;extended Kalman filter;EKF;seeker gimbals;low-cost strapdown inertial unit;linearizing feedback control law;motion decoupling;visual information;target tracking;image sequence;cruciform missile;canards;rollerons;3D interception tasks;Monte Carlo simulation","","52","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As such, if one desires to learn a control law in real-time, a fusion of soft computing techniques to learn the appropriate control law with hard computing techniques to maintain the stability constraint and guarantee convergence is required. The objective of the paper is to describe an adaptive dynamic programming algorithm (ADPA) which fuses soft computing techniques to learn the optimal cost (or return) functional for a stabilizable nonlinear system with unknown dynamics and hard computing techniques to verify the stability and convergence of the algorithm. Specifically, the algorithm is initialized with a (stabilizing) cost functional and the system is run with the corresponding control law (defined by the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation), with the resultant state trajectories used to update the cost functional in a soft computing mode. Hard computing techniques are then used to show that this process is globally convergent with stepwise stability to the optimal cost functional/control law pair for an (unknown) input affine system with an input quadratic performance measure (modulo the appropriate technical conditions). Three specific implementations of the ADPA are developed for 1) the linear case, 2) for the nonlinear case using a locally quadratic approximation to the cost functional, and 3) the nonlinear case using a radial basis function approximation of the cost functional; illustrated by applications to flight control.","1558-2442","","10.1109/TSMCC.2002.801727","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1039198","","Dynamic programming;Cost function;Function approximation;Control systems;Stability;Convergence;Computer applications;Heuristic algorithms;Fuses;Nonlinear systems","dynamic programming;adaptive control;stability;convergence;nonlinear control systems;learning (artificial intelligence);aerospace control;optimal control","soft computing applications;optimal cost functional;nonlinear system;unknown dynamics;hard computing;Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation;state trajectories;input affine system;input quadratic performance measure;radial basis function approximation;flight control;adaptive control;optimal control;nonlinear control;control law;real-time;stability constraint;convergence;adaptive dynamic programming algorithm","","407","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is achieved by exploiting the fact that the materials comprising the various objects in a scene reflect, absorb, and emit electromagnetic radiation in ways characteristic of their molecular composition and shape. If the radiation arriving at the sensor is measured at each wavelength over a sufficiently broad spectral band, the resulting spectral signature, or simply spectrum, can be used (in principle) to uniquely characterize and identify any given material. An important function of hyperspectral signal processing is to eliminate the redundancy in the spectral and spatial sample data while preserving the high-quality features needed for detection, discrimination, and classification. This dimensionality reduction is implemented in a scene-dependent (adaptive) manner and may be implemented as a distinct step in the processing or as an integral part of the overall algorithm.

An LED light source made of red, green and blue (RGB) LEDs can provide a compact light source with unique features such as instant color variability. However, the white light generation using many compact, discrete RGB light sources has the following issues: uniform spatial light mixing and distribution, white color point maintenance and thermal management. Specifically, the white color point maintenance is a stringent requirement in many applications. Meeting this requirement is a severe challenge due to the variation in the optical characteristics of the RGB-LEDs with temperature, time and forward current and the spread in the LED performance. This results in (1) an unacceptably high variability in white light color point, and (2) difficulties in manufacturing reproducible LED lamps.","0197-2618","0-7803-7420-7","10.1109/IAS.2002.1044108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1044108","","Light emitting diodes;Lighting control;Light sources;LED lamps;Thermal management;Temperature;Feedback control;Phosphors;Solid state lighting;Optical feedback","light emitting diodes;optical properties;feedback;lamps;lighting control","red LED;blue LED;green LED;high-power light emitting diodes;compact light source;instant color variability;white light generation;uniform spatial light mixing;uniform spatial light distribution;white color point maintenance;thermal management;optical characteristics;white light color point;reproducible LED lamps manufacture;feedback control;light sensing;color filters;tristimulus values","","79","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

IEEE","","2002","1","","72","76 vol.1","IEEE 802.11 MAC mainly relies on two techniques to combat interference: physical carrier sensing and RTS/CTS handshake (also known as ""virtual carrier sensing""). Ideally, the RTS/CTS handshake can eliminate most interference. However, the effectiveness of RTS/CTS handshake is based on the assumption that hidden nodes are within transmission range of receivers. In this paper, we prove using analytic models that in ad hoc networks, such an assumption cannot hold due to the fact that power needed for interrupting a packet reception is much lower than that of delivering a packet successfully. Thus, the ""virtual carrier sensing"" implemented by RTS/CTS handshake cannot prevent all interference. Physical carrier sensing can complement this in some degree. However, since interference happens at receivers, while physical carrier sensing is detecting transmitters (the same problem causing the hidden terminal situation), physical carrier sensing cannot help much, unless a very large carrier sensing range is adopted, which is limited by the antenna sensitivity. We investigate how effective is the RTS/CTS handshake in terms of reducing interference. We show that in some situations, the interference range is much larger than transmission range, where RTS/CTS cannot function well. Then, a simple MAC layer scheme is proposed to solve this problem. Simulation results verify that our scheme can help IEEE 802.11 resolve most interference caused by large interference range.","","0-7803-7632-3","10.1109/GLOCOM.2002.1188044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1188044","","Intelligent networks;Ad hoc networks;Media Access Protocol;Transmitters;Operating systems;Computer science;USA Councils;Interference elimination;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas","IEEE standards;telecommunication standards;access protocols;ad hoc networks;radiofrequency interference;interference suppression;land mobile radio","IEEE 802.11 RTS/CTS handshake;ad hoc networks;IEEE 802.11 MAC;interference suppression;hidden nodes;transmission range;receivers;packet reception;transmitters;hidden terminal;carrier sensing range;antenna sensitivity;MAC layer;simulation results;physical carrier sensing;virtual carrier sensing","","249","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Depending on the matching goal, a subset of the mapping is chosen using filters. After our algorithm runs, we expect a human to check and if necessary adjust the results. As a matter of fact, we evaluate the 'accuracy' of the algorithm by counting the number of needed adjustments. We conducted a user study, in which our accuracy metric was used to estimate the labor savings that the users could obtain by utilizing our algorithm to obtain an initial matching.

Since impact-ionization is an abrupt function of the electric field (or the carrier energy), simulations show that the device has a subthreshold slope much lower than kT/q. Simulations also show that it is indeed possible to make complementary circuits with switching speeds comparable to or exceeding CMOS. Experimental results on a silicon based prototype verify the basic concept and show very steep subthreshold slopes with high speed turn-on and turn-off.

An impedance control system based on a positioning control of a robot with time delay of the robot and a human operator can become unstable when the stiffness of a human arm or body is increased in the human-robot cooperative task. The proposed variable impedance controller varies the viscosity coefficient of the robot in proportion to an estimated value of the stiffness of the tip of the human arm. A method of a proposed variable impedance control makes the human-robot cooperative system stable and the cooperative task easy. In order to confirm the usefulness of the proposed control method a cooperative calligraphic task, that is writing a Kanji character with a writing brush, is performed. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed control method is effective for the human-robot cooperative task.","","0-7803-7272-7","10.1109/ROBOT.2002.1013431","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1013431","","Impedance;Humans;Control systems;Writing;Robot control;Delay effects;Proportional control;Viscosity;Cooperative systems;Brushes","robot dynamics;man-machine systems;position control;cooperative systems;mechanical variables control;humanities","human-robot cooperative task;variable impedance control;positioning control;time delay;viscosity coefficient;stiffness;cooperative system;calligraphic task;Kanji character writing","","105","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is done by monitoring the current responses to the inductance variation on the rotor position. The rotor position at standstill is detected by comparing the first and second differences of six current pulses injected into every two phases of the motor. Once the motor starts up, a pulse train, composed of long and short pulses, is injected into the commutation phases corresponding to the maximum torque production and the next commutation phases in alternating fashion. It provides not only the torque, but also information about the next commutation timing when the current responses of the long and short pulses cross each other in the same time delay. A controller for a BLDC motor is developed using a PC, digital signal processor (DSP), inverter and communication circuits in order to verify the proposed algorithm experimentally. It shows that the proposed algorithm can drive a BLDC motor smoothly without any vibration or time delay up to medium speed compared with the conventional back-EMF algorithm. Beyond this medium speed, a sensorless algorithm for rotor-position detection is switched to the back-EMF method to drive a BLDC motor at high speed.","1350-2352","","10.1049/ip-epa:20020022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=997804","","","brushless DC motors;position measurement;inductance;rotors;commutation;finite element analysis;starting","sensorless BLDC motor;inductance;rotor;start-up algorithm;position detection;current responses monitoring;inductance variation;rotor position;current pulses injection;pulse train;commutation phases;maximum torque production;commutation timing;short pulses;BLDC motor;brushless DC motor;finite-element analysis","","62","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals"

High chip rates in wideband CDMA systems facilitate accurate TDOA measurements, and a smart antenna used at the home base station (BS) can provide accurate AOA measurement in a macrocell environment. A two-step least square location estimator is developed based on a linear form of the AOA equation in the small error region.

However, identifying good transfer functions is difficult enough in 1D, let alone 2D or 3D. This paper demonstrates an important class of 3D transfer functions for scalar data, and describes the application of multi-dimensional transfer functions to multivariate data. We present a set of direct manipulation widgets that make specifying such transfer functions intuitive and convenient.

Sci., Stanford Univ., CA, USA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Reliability","","2002","51","1","111","122","This paper presents a new signature monitoring technique, CFCSS (control flow checking by software signatures); CFCSS is a pure software method that checks the control flow of a program using assigned signatures. An algorithm assigns a unique signature to each node in the program graph and adds instructions for error detection. Signatures are embedded in the program during compilation time using the constant field of the instructions and compared with run-time signatures when the program is executed. Another algorithm reduces the code size and execution time overhead caused by checking instructions in CFCSS. A ""branching fault injection experiment"" was performed with benchmark programs. Without CFCSS, an average of 33.7 % of the injected branching faults produced undetected incorrect outputs; however, with CFCSS, only 3.1 % of branching faults produced undetected incorrect outputs. Thus it is possible to increase error detection coverage for control flow errors by an order of magnitude using CFCSS. The distinctive advantage of CFCSS over previous signature monitoring techniques is that CFCSS is a pure software method, i.e., it needs no dedicated hardware such as a watchdog processor for control flow checking. A watchdog task in multitasking environment also needs no extra hardware, but the advantage of CFCSS over a watchdog task is that CFCSS can be used even when the operating system does not support multitasking.","1558-1721","","10.1109/24.994926","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=994926","","Monitoring;Runtime;Error correction;Hardware;Multitasking;Central Processing Unit;Process control;Operating systems;Fault detection;Satellites","program testing;program diagnostics;software reliability","control flow checking by software signatures;assigned signatures;program graph;error detection instructions;compilation time;run-time signatures;code size reduction;instructions checking;execution time overhead reduction;branching fault injection experiment;undetected incorrect outputs;branching faults;signature monitoring techniques;software method;watchdog task;multitasking environment","","335","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For these reasons, six-phase induction motors are beginning to be a widely acceptable alternative in high power applications. A typical construction of such drives includes an induction machine with a dual three-phase connection, where two three-phase groups are spatially shifted 30 electrical degrees, a six-leg inverter, and a control circuit. By controlling the machine's phase currents, harmonic elimination and torque-ripple reduction techniques could be implemented. This paper describes a technique of injecting third harmonic zero sequence current components in the phase currents, which greatly improves the machine torque density. Analytical, finite-element, and experimental results are presented to show the system operation and to demonstrate the improvement on the torque density.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2002.802938","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1035189","","Induction motors;Magnetic flux;Power system harmonics;Minimization;Static power converters;Torque converters;Induction machines;Inverters;Circuits;Torque control","induction motor drives;invertors;DC-AC power convertors;power conversion harmonics;harmonic distortion;machine theory;machine testing;torque","six-phase induction motor;industrial drives;reliability;magnetic flux harmonic reduction;torque pulsations minimization;static converter power ratings;six-leg inverter;harmonic elimination;third harmonic zero sequence current components injection;machine torque density","","175","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents the theory and practical characterization of phase noise in oscillators due to colored, as opposed to white, noise sources. Shot and thermal noise sources in oscillators can be modeled as white-noise sources for all practical purposes. The characterization of phase noise in oscillators due to shot and thermal noise sources is covered by a recently developed theory of phase noise due to white-noise sources. The extension of this theory and the practical characterization techniques to noise sources in oscillators, which have a colored spectral density, e.g., 1/f noise, is crucial for practical applications. In this paper, we first derive a stochastic characterization of phase noise in oscillators due to colored-noise sources. This stochastic analysis is based on a novel nonlinear perturbation analysis for autonomous systems, and a nonlocal Fokker-Planck equation we derive. Then, we calculate the resulting spectrum of the oscillator output with phase noise as characterized. We also extend our results to the case when both white and colored-noise sources are present. Our treatment of phase noise due to colored-noise sources is general, i.e., it is not specific to a particular type of colored-noise source.","1558-1268","","10.1109/TCSI.2002.805707","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1159110","","Phase noise;Timing jitter;Oscillators;Colored noise;Optical noise;Stochastic resonance;Wireless communication;Optical fiber communication;Bit error rate;Communication systems","oscillators;nonlinear network analysis;circuit noise;phase noise;timing jitter;1/f noise;stochastic processes;perturbation techniques;Fokker-Planck equation;nonlinear differential equations;burst noise","oscillators;phase noise;timing jitter;colored-noise sources;1/f noise;stochastic characterization;nonlinear perturbation analysis;autonomous systems;nonlocal Fokker-Planck equation;nonlinear differential equation;burst noise;Colpitts oscillator","","132","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to understand the influence of these parameters, a set of experiments was designed and performed to fully characterize the sensitivity of surface morphology and mechanical behavior of silicon samples produced with different DRIE operating conditions. The designed experiment involved a matrix of 55 silicon wafers with radius hub flexure (RHF) specimens which were etched 10 min under varying DRIE processing conditions. Data collected by interferometry, atomic force microscopy (AFM), profilometry, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), was used to determine the response of etching performance to operating conditions. The data collected for fracture strength was analyzed and modeled by finite element computation. The data was then fitted to response surfaces to model the dependence of response variables on dry processing conditions.","1941-0158","","10.1109/JMEMS.2002.1007405","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1007405","","Surface morphology;Etching;Response surface methodology;Silicon;Atomic force microscopy;Scanning electron microscopy;Microelectromechanical devices;Interferometry;Atomic measurements;Numerical analysis","sputter etching;micromechanical devices;light interferometry;atomic force microscopy;scanning electron microscopy;finite element analysis;surface fitting","process parameters;surface morphology;mechanical performance;deep reactive ion etching;MEMS;post-etch mechanical behavior;operating conditions;radius hub flexure;interferometry;atomic force microscopy;profilometry;scanning electron microscopy;etching performance;fracture strength;finite element computation;response surfaces;response variables;DRIE;10 min;Si","","149","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With our novel growing hierarchical SOM (GHSOM) we address both limitations. The GHSOM is an artificial neural-network model with hierarchical architecture composed of independent growing SOMs. The motivation was to provide a model that adapts its architecture during its unsupervised training process according to the particular requirements of the input data. Furthermore, by providing a global orientation of the independently growing maps in the individual layers of the hierarchy, navigation across branches is facilitated. The benefits of this novel neural network are a problem-dependent architecture and the intuitive representation of hierarchical relations in the data. This is especially appealing in explorative data mining applications, allowing the inherent structure of the data to unfold in a highly intuitive fashion.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2002.804221","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1058070","","Data analysis;Data mining;Space technology;Pattern recognition;Unsupervised learning;Navigation;Neural networks;Functional analysis;Pattern analysis;Multidimensional systems","data analysis;self-organising feature maps;neural net architecture;data mining;unsupervised learning;pattern recognition","growing hierarchical self-organizing map;high-dimensional data analysis;unsupervised neural-network;data mining;GHSOM;hierarchical architecture;unsupervised learning;hierarchical relations;pattern recognition","","280","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The combination of information from multiple cardiac image modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, positron emission tomography, single-photon emission computed tomography, and ultrasound, is of increasing interest in the medical community for physiologic understanding and diagnostic purposes. Registration of cardiac images is a more complex problem than brain image registration because the heart is a nonrigid moving organ inside a moving body. Moreover, as compared to the registration of brain images, the heart exhibits much fewer accurate anatomical landmarks. In a clinical context, physicians often mentally integrate image information from different modalities.

In the paradigm of network coding, the nodes in a network are allowed to encode the information received from the input links. The usual function of switching at a node is a special case of network coding. The advantage of network coding is that the full capacity of the network can be utilized. In this paper, we propose a new model which incorporates network coding and information security. Specifically, a collection of subsets of links is given, and a wiretapper is allowed to access any one (but not more than one) of these subsets without being able to obtain any information about the message transmitted. Our model includes secret sharing as a special case.

In this respect, there has been much literature published, although not so much on the actual performance of such controllers in a practical setting. The primary focus in this paper is on the development and actual implementation of intelligent and stable fuzzy proportional derivative-proportional integral (PD-PI) controllers for steering and speed control of an AGV. The AGV used in this study is an electrically powered golf car, suitably modified for autonomous navigation and control. The use of fuzzy logic for control law synthesis, among other things, facilitates the incorporation of control heuristics, while guaranteeing stability, uncoupling steering control from speed control and providing for easy incorporation of a braking controller. Through experimentation, the designed controllers are demonstrated to be insensitive to parametric uncertainty, load and parameter fluctuations and, most importantly, amenable to real-time implementation. The performance of the proposed uncoupled direct fuzzy PD/PI control schemes for this particular outdoor AGV is also compared against conventional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed fuzzy logic controllers, which are synthesized from a variable structure systems viewpoint, also outperform conventional PID schemes, particularly in tracking accuracy, steady-state error, control chatter and robustness.","1558-0865","","10.1109/87.974344","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=974344","","Fuzzy control;Mobile robots;Pi control;Remotely operated vehicles;PD control;Proportional control;Velocity control;Fuzzy logic;Three-term control;Intelligent vehicles","automatic guided vehicles;fuzzy control;velocity control;motion control;position control;braking;variable structure systems;robust control;two-term control;control system synthesis;real-time systems;fluctuations;performance index","autonomous guided vehicles;fuzzy speed control;fuzzy steering control;lateral control;longitudinal control;vehicle control;mobile robots;controller performance;intelligent stable fuzzy proportional derivative-proportional integral controllers;electrically powered golf car;autonomous navigation;fuzzy logic control;control law synthesis;control heuristics;stability;braking controller;parametric uncertainty;load fluctuations;parameter fluctuations;real-time implementation;uncoupled direct fuzzy PD/PI control schemes;outdoor AGV;PID controllers;variable structure systems;tracking accuracy;steady-state error;control chatter;robustness;velocity control","","73","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the noise produced by the environment and by the patient often distorts the ECG data. Motion artifact, the most prevalent and difficult type of noise to filter in exercise ECG, corrupts the intelligibility of the desired signal thus reducing the reliability of the stress test. In this paper, the researchers aim to demonstrate a new adaptive filtering method for stress ECG signals. This noise cancellation scheme uses an accelerometer as a source of noise reference. Experiments involving single-axis and dual-axis motion sensors are conducted to evaluate the efficiency of this technique. The acquired real ECG and accelerometer data are simultaneously processed and analyzed using the two most widely used adaptive filtering algorithms, least mean squares (LMS) and recursive least squares (RLS).

The paper contributes to image segmentation in four aspects. First, it designs efficient and well-balanced Markov Chain dynamics to explore the complex solution space and, thus, achieves a nearly global optimal solution independent of initial segmentations. Second, it presents a mathematical principle and a K-adventurers algorithm for computing multiple distinct solutions from the Markov chain sequence and, thus, it incorporates intrinsic ambiguities in image segmentation. Third, it utilizes data-driven (bottom-up) techniques, such as clustering and edge detection, to compute importance proposal probabilities, which drive the Markov chain dynamics and achieve tremendous speedup in comparison to the traditional jump-diffusion methods. Fourth, the DDMCMC paradigm provides a unifying framework in which the role of many existing segmentation algorithms, such as, edge detection, clustering, region growing, split-merge, snake/balloon, and region competition, are revealed as either realizing Markov chain dynamics or computing importance proposal probabilities. Thus, the DDMCMC paradigm combines and generalizes these segmentation methods in a principled way. The DDMCMC paradigm adopts seven parametric and nonparametric image models for intensity and color at various regions. We test the DDMCMC paradigm extensively on both color and gray-level images and some results are reported in this paper.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.1000239","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1000239","","Image segmentation;Monte Carlo methods","image segmentation;Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods","Data-Driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo;image segmentation;Bayesian statistical framework;computational paradigm;split-merge;snake/balloon;region competition;data clustering;Markov random field;Markov chain sequence;clustering;edge detection","","324","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A lot of different definitions of jitter are available in the literature; this work addresses also the problem of identifying correctly among them the ""effective"" jitter for a given SNR.

It is shown that, under ideal noise-free conditions, correspondences formed using this distance function are correct more often than correspondences formed using the positional distance alone. In addition, monotonic convergence to at least a local minimum is shown to hold for this method. When noise is present, a method that automatically sets the optimal relative contribution of features and positions is described. This method trades off the error in feature values due to noise against the error in positions due to misalignment. Experimental results suggest that using invariant features decreases the probability of being trapped in a local minimum and may be an effective solution for difficult range image registration problems where the scene is very small compared to the model.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.982886","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=982886","","Layout;Iterative closest point algorithm;Iterative algorithms;Image registration;Least squares approximation;Robustness;Convergence;Computer vision;Computer graphics;Application software","iterative methods;image registration;invariance;feature extraction;minimisation;convergence of numerical methods;errors;noise","iterative closest point registration;Euclidean invariant features;range image registration;pointwise correspondences;weighted linear combination;positional distance;feature distance;ideal noise-free conditions;distance function;monotonic convergence;local minimum;optimal relative contribution;misalignment;small scenes;feature detection","","340","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A detection and approximation estimator is used for online health monitoring. Once a fault is detected, a bank of isolation estimators is activated for the purpose of fault isolation. A key design issue of the proposed fault isolation scheme is the adaptive residual threshold associated with each isolation estimator. A fault that has occurred can be isolated if the residual associated with the matched isolation estimator remains below its corresponding adaptive threshold, whereas at least one of the components of the residuals associated with all the other estimators exceeds its threshold at some finite time. Based on the class of nonlinear uncertain systems under consideration, an isolation decision scheme is devised and fault isolability conditions are given, characterizing the class of nonlinear faults that are isolable by the robust fault isolation scheme. The nonconservativeness of the fault isolability conditions is illustrated by deriving a subclass of nonlinear systems and of faults for which these conditions are also necessary for fault isolability. Moreover, the analysis of the proposed fault isolation scheme provides rigorous analytical results concerning the fault isolation time. Two simulation examples are given to show the effectiveness of the fault diagnosis methodology.","1558-2523","","10.1109/9.995036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=995036","","Robustness;Fault detection;Nonlinear systems;Fault diagnosis;Equations;Algorithm design and analysis;Monitoring;Uncertain systems;Uncertainty;State estimation","fault diagnosis;nonlinear dynamical systems;nonlinear control systems;state estimation;robust control;uncertain systems","robust detection and isolation scheme;incipient faults;abrupt faults;robust fault diagnosis;online health monitoring;isolation estimators;adaptive residual threshold;fault isolability conditions;simulation examples;nonlinear adaptive estimator;nonlinear uncertain dynamic systems","","386","","57","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The estimation of tire-road friction coefficient at the wheels allows the control algorithm in such systems to adapt to external driving conditions. This paper develops a new tire-road friction coefficient estimation algorithm based on measurements related to the lateral dynamics of the vehicle. A lateral tire force model parameterized as a function of slip angle, friction coefficient, normal force and cornering stiffness is used. A real-time parameter identification algorithm that utilizes measurements from a differential global positioning system (DGPS) system and a gyroscope is used to identify the tire-road friction coefficient and cornering stiffness parameters of the tire. The advantage of the developed algorithm is that it does not require large longitudinal slip in order to provide reliable friction estimates. Simulation studies indicate that a parameter convergence rate of 1 s can be obtained. Experiments conducted on both dry and slippery road indicate that the algorithm can work very effectively in identifying a slippery road.","1558-0865","","10.1109/87.998016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=998016","","Friction;Automatic control;Control systems;Tires;Road vehicles;Collision avoidance;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Stability;Wheels","road vehicles;Global Positioning System;friction;mechanical variables measurement;real-time systems;identification;adaptive control;collision avoidance;stability","GPS-based real-time identification;tire-road friction coefficient;vehicle control systems;collision avoidance;adaptive cruise control;automated lane-keeping systems;ABS;wheels;slip angle;friction coefficient;normal force;cornering stiffness;stability control systems;road-adaptive systems;real-time parameter identification algorithm;differential global positioning system;DGPS;gyroscope;parameter convergence;dry road;slippery road","","128","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Models of performance of these devices would be useful engineering tools. However, the benefit of the model is only as accurate as the material properties used in the model. The purpose of this investigation is to measure the elastic, dielectric and piezoelectric properties over a frequency range, including the imaginary part (loss) of these properties. Measurements are difficult because poled material is available as thin films, and not all quantities can be measured in that form. All components of the elastic stiffness, dielectric tensor, and electromechanical coupling tensor are needed in the models. The material studied here is uniaxially oriented poled PVDF that has orthorhombic mm2 symmetry. Presented are the frequency dependence of all nine complex elastic constants, three complex dielectric constants, and five complex piezoelectric constants. The PVDF was produced at Raytheon Research Division, Lexington, MA. Measurements were made on thin films and on stacked, cubical samples. The elastic constants c/sub 44//sup D/ and c/sub 55//sup D/, the dielectric constants e/sub 11//sup T/ and e/sub 22//sup T/, as well as the piezoelectric constants g/sub 15/ and g/sub 24/ reported here have not been published before.

This paper reviews some of the technical reasons behind the wide-spread acceptance of Raman technology. Distributed Raman amplifiers improve the noise figure and reduce the nonlinear penalty of fiber systems, allowing for longer amplifier spans, higher bit rates, closer channel spacing, and operation near the zero-dispersion wavelength. Lumped or discrete Raman amplifiers are primarily used to increase the capacity of fiber-optic networks, opening up new wavelength windows for wavelength-division multiplexing such as the 1300 nm, 1400 nm, or short-wavelength S-band. As an example, using a cascade of S-band lumped amplifiers, a 20-channel, OC-192 system is shown that propagates over 867 km of standard, single-mode fiber. Raman amplifiers provide a simple single platform for long-haul and ultralong-haul amplifier needs and, therefore, should see a wide range of deployment in the next few years.","1558-4542","","10.1109/JSTQE.2002.1016358","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1016358","","Stimulated emission;Optical fiber amplifiers;Optical amplifiers;Optical fiber devices;Distributed amplifiers;Operational amplifiers;Semiconductor optical amplifiers;Commercialization;Nonlinear optical devices;Noise figure","Raman lasers;optical fibre amplifiers;optical transmitters;nonlinear optics;laser noise;optical fibre networks","Raman amplifiers;long-haul fiber-optic transmission systems;ultralong-haul fiber-optic transmission systems;nonlinear optical devices;telecommunications;distributed Raman amplifiers;noise figure;nonlinear penalty;amplifier spans;bit rates;channel spacing;zero-dispersion wavelength;lumped Raman amplifiers;fiber-optic network capacity;wavelength-division multiplexing;short-wavelength S-band;S-band lumped amplifier cascade;optical fiber amplifiers;OC-192 system;Raman transmission system experiments;1300 nm;1400 nm;867 km","","270","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The controller provably guarantees global asymptotic convergence of force trajectory tracking errors to zero when the robot is under exact or asymptotically exact inner loop velocity control. An additional result which guarantees arbitrarily small force errors for bounded inner loop velocity tracking errors is presented.

To counter this trend, the issues of network security at the e-commerce and customer sites must be constantly reviewed and appropriate countermeasures devised. These security measures must be implemented so that they do not inhibit or dissuade the intended e-commerce operation. This paper will discuss pertinent network and computer security issues and will present some of the threats to e-commerce and customer privacy. These threats originate from both hackers as well as the e-commerce site itself. A straightforward comparison could be made of the security weaknesses in the postal system vs. security weaknesses on the Net. The vulnerable spots in both cases are at the endpoints - the customer's computer/network and the business' servers/network. Information flowing in the conduit (trucks/planes and wires) is relatively immune to everyday break-ins. Privacy issues are amongst the major drivers for improved network security along with the elimination of theft, fraud and vandalism. Two major threats to customer privacy and confidence come from sources both hostile to the environment as well as sources seemingly friendly. Coordinated attacks on Yahoo, eBay, ZDNet, Buy.com (on their IPO day) and amazon.com generated a huge amount of publicity and a federal government response. A brief description of these attacks will be given in this paper. Another threat may originate at ostensibly friendly companies such as DoubleClick, MemberWorks and similar firms that collect customer information and route it to other firms. Much of this transaction information is able to be associated with a specific person making these seemingly friendly actions potential threats to consumer privacy. Many of the issues and countermeasure discussed here come from experiences derived with consulting with clients on how to maintain secure e-commerce facilities. These methods and techniques can be useful in a variety of client and server environments, also serving to alert e-commerce users of potential threats.","","0-7695-1435-9","10.1109/HICSS.2002.994190","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=994190","","Privacy;Information security;Internet;Counting circuits;Computer security;Computer hacking;Computer networks;Network servers;Wires;US Government","electronic commerce;data privacy;security of data","client server environments;security;network security;privacy;confidence;consumer privacy;Internet commerce;trust;e-commerce;hacker attacks;viruses;worms","","25","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A method of locating the maximum power point (MPP) is based on injecting a small-signal sinusoidal perturbation into the switching frequency and comparing the AC component and the average value of the panel terminal voltage. Apart from not requiring any sophisticated digital computation of the panel power, the proposed technique does not approximate the panel characteristics and can globally locate the MPP under wide insolation conditions.

The visual tracking algorithm is based on cropping an online template of the tracked feature from the current image frame and testing where this template correlates in the subsequent frame. The location of the highest correlation is interpreted as the new location of the feature in the subsequent frame. Various body features are examined for tracking robustness and user convenience. A group of 20 people without disabilities tested the Camera Mouse and quickly learned how to use it to spell out messages or play games.

It improves the input 1-dB gain compression point by 18.5 (20) dB and phase distortion by 6.1/spl deg/ (12.42/spl deg/) at an output power of 28 (28) dBm for the PCS (W-CDMA) band while keeping the base bias voltage of the power amplifier as designed. A PCS and W-CDMA dual-band InGaP heterojunction bipolar transistor MMIC power amplifier with single input and output and no switch for band selection is embodied by implementing the linearizer and by designing the amplifier to have broad-band characteristics. The dual-band power amplifier exhibits an output power of 30 (28.5) dBm, power-added efficiency of 39.5 % (36 %), and adjacent channel power ratio of -46 (-50) dBc at the output power of 28 (28) dBm under 3.4-V operation voltage for PCS (W-CDMA) applications.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2002.801169","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1028085","","Personal communication networks;Multiaccess communication;Dual band;MMICs;Power amplifiers;Circuits;Power generation;Broadband amplifiers;Radiofrequency amplifiers;Voltage","indium compounds;gallium compounds;III-V semiconductors;MMIC power amplifiers;bipolar MMIC;code division multiple access;personal communication networks;linearisation techniques;heterojunction bipolar transistors;mobile radio","PCS/W-CDMA dual-band amplifier;dual-band MMIC power amplifier;personal communications service;wideband CDMA;wideband code division multiple access;single-chip MMIC;single-path output matching network;on-chip linearizer;linearizing bias circuit;PCS band;W-CDMA band;InGaP HBT amplifier;heterojunction bipolar transistor amplifier;3.4 V;36 to 39.5 percent;InGaP","","61","","3","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For the power-conversion circuit, which is necessary to compensate the voltage variations of the supercapacitors during charge and discharge, a high-efficiency converter, topology is proposed, which allows the bidirectional energy flow under soft-commutation conditions.

At rates of tens of bits per second per hertz, Vertical Bell Labs Layered Space-Time (V-BLAST), where every antenna transmits its own independent substream of data, has been shown to have good performance and simple encoding and decoding. Yet V-BLAST suffers from its inability to work with fewer receive antennas than transmit antennas-this deficiency is especially important for modern cellular systems, where a base station typically has more antennas than the mobile handsets. Furthermore, because V-BLAST transmits independent data streams on its antennas there is no built-in spatial coding to guard against deep fades from any given transmit antenna. On the other hand, there are many previously proposed space-time codes that have good fading resistance and simple decoding, but these codes generally have poor performance at high data rates or with many antennas. We propose a high-rate coding scheme that can handle any configuration of transmit and receive antennas and that subsumes both V-BLAST and many proposed space-time block codes as special cases. The scheme transmits substreams of data in linear combinations over space and time. The codes are designed to optimize the mutual information between the transmitted and received signals. Because of their linear structure, the codes retain the decoding simplicity of V-BLAST, and because of their information-theoretic optimality, they possess many coding advantages. We give examples of the codes and show that their performance is generally superior to earlier proposed methods over a wide range of rates and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2002.1013127","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1013127","","Linear codes;Block codes;Information rates;Antenna arrays;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Decoding;Land mobile radio cellular systems","linear codes;block codes;channel capacity;antenna arrays;receiving antennas;transmitting antennas;decoding;cellular radio;fading channels","high-rate codes;linear codes;space-time codes;space-time transmission;large traffic volume;Vertical Bell Labs Layered Space-Time;V-BLAST;encoding;decoding;receive antennas;transmit antennas;cellular systems;base station;mobile handsets;data streams transmission;fading resistance;spatial coding;space-time block codes;information-theoretic optimality;signal-to-noise ratio;SNR;code rate;mutual information","","917","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The electromagnetic properties of such metamaterial plates, which can indeed be regarded as frequency-selective surfaces, are influenced by the shape and geometry of these inclusions. When a metamaterial surface is closely placed above a perfectly conducting plate, at a certain frequency band, this structure may possess a high surface impedance at its top surface, thus providing a high-impedance ground plane (HIGP). The center frequency and bandwidth over which such a high-impedance electromagnetic surface is achieved depend on inclusion shapes and compositions, among other parameters. By placing a resistive sheet on top of this surface, we can achieve a thin structure that can be an efficient absorber for incident electromagnetic energy.","","0-7803-7330-8","10.1109/APS.2002.1016106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1016106","","Metamaterials;Surface waves;Surface impedance;Magnetic materials;Frequency;Dielectrics;Shape;Reflectivity;Dipole antennas;Transmission line matrix methods","surface impedance;absorbing media;periodic structures;frequency selective surfaces;conducting bodies;multilayers;electromagnetic wave absorption","thin absorbing screens;metamaterial surfaces;2-dimensional periodic arrangement;2D periodic arrangement;flat inclusions;homogeneous surface;electromagnetic properties;frequency-selective surfaces;perfectly conducting plate;surface impedance;high-impedance ground plane;resistive sheet","","162","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In practice, it is often limited to data collection and packet-level inspection; however, a network forensics analysis tool can provide a richer view of the data collected, allowing you to inspect the traffic from further up the protocol stack? The IT industry's ever-growing concern with security is the primary motivation for network forensics. A network that has been prepared for forensic analysis is easy to monitor, and security vulnerabilities and configuration problems can be conveniently identified.

The approach has been applied to engineering design selection, organizational self-assessment, safety and risk assessment, and supplier assessment. In this paper, the fundamental features of the ER approach are investigated. New schemes for weight normalization and basic probability assignments are proposed. The original ER approach is further developed to enhance the process of aggregating attributes with uncertainty. Utility intervals are proposed to describe the impact of ignorance on decision analysis. Several properties of the new ER approach are explored, which lay the theoretical foundation of the ER approach.

In a military application, EW provides the means to counter, in all battle phases, hostile actions that involve the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum-from the beginning when enemy forces are mobilized for an attack, through to the final engagement. EW exploits the EM environment by sensing and analyzing an adversary's application of the spectrum and imposing appropriate countermeasures (CMs) to hostile spectrum use. EW sensors are one means by which the military gathers tactical intelligence from noncooperative forces. EW sensors, together with EW CMs, mitigate the effectiveness of an adversary's electrooptic/infrared, and radio frequency-controlled weapons. EW enhances the survivability of the host force through control and manipulation of the EM environment and denies or limits its use by an adversary.

We consider two cases differentiated based on the type of channel knowledge used in the selection process. We address both the selection algorithms and the performance analysis. We first consider the case when the antenna subsets are selected based on exact channel knowledge (ECK). Our results assume the transmission of orthogonal space-time block codes (with emphasis on the Alamouti (see IEEE J. Select. Areas Commun., vol.16, p.1451-68, Oct. 1998) code). Next, we treat the case of antenna subset selection when statistical channel knowledge (SCK) is employed by the selection algorithm. This analysis is applicable to general space-time coding schemes. When ECK is available, we show that the selection algorithm chooses the antenna set that maximizes the channel Frobenius norm leading to both coding and diversity gain. When SCK is available, the selection algorithm chooses the antenna set that maximizes the determinant of the covariance of the vectorized channel leading mostly to a coding gain. In case of ECK-based selection, we provide analytical expressions for average SNR and outage probability improvement. For the case when SCK-based selection is used, we derive expressions for coding gain. We also present extensive simulation studies, validating our results.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2002.803337","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1033687","","MIMO;Receiving antennas;Performance analysis;Diversity reception;Radio frequency;Transmitting antennas;Channel capacity;Block codes;Diversity methods;Space technology","MIMO systems;block codes;covariance matrices;telecommunication channels;antenna arrays;radio links;probability;diversity reception;noise","MIMO antenna subset selection;space-time coding;multiple-input multiple-output;selection algorithms;performance analysis;exact channel knowledge;orthogonal space-time block codes;Alamouti code;statistical channel knowledge;Frobenius norm;coding gain;diversity gain;covariance determinant;vectorized channel;average SNR;outage probability;simulation;point-to-point wireless link","","396","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, relatively long time anneals were performed in a conventional tungsten-based RTA to investigate the activation mechanisms. The activation was monitored using Hall measurement, where the rate of electrical activation was considered by measuring the time it takes to reach 50% activation. Using Arrhenius fits, an activation energy was extracted, and it was found that while boron has a mean activation energy for electrical activation of 4.7 eV in agreement with previous studies, arsenic and phosphorus have thermal activation energies of 3.6 eV and 4.1 eV, respectively. The 4.7 eV activation energy for boron is believed to be related to a point defect driven mechanism for electrical activation. Electrical activation of arsenic and phosphorus, however, seems to be related to dopant diffusion. In the second set of experiments, an arc lamp system was utilized to perform ultra-sharp spike anneals. For both dopants, it was found that for a given temperature, there is an optimum ramp-rate that produces the desired dopant activation and junction depth.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2002.1013274","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1013274","","Ion implantation;Boron;Boron compounds;Phosphorus;Silicon;Rapid thermal annealing;Diffusion processes;Semiconductor process modeling","ion implantation;boron;boron compounds;arsenic;phosphorus;elemental semiconductors;silicon;rapid thermal annealing;point defects;diffusion;semiconductor process modelling","dopant activation;ultra-low energy implants;rapid thermal anneals;Hall measurement;Arrhenius fits;thermal activation energies;point defect driven mechanism;arc lamp system;optimum ramp-rate;junction depth;900 to 1050 degC;4.7 eV;3.6 eV;4.1 eV;Si:B;Si:BF/sub 2/;Si:As;Si:P","","37","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As compared to RTONO oxynitride, pMOSFET threshold voltage shift and transconductance degradation have been problematic for devices using remote plasma nitridation (RPN) or decoupled plasma nitridation (DPN) process due to non-optimal nitrogen profile in the film. In this paper, we report that the nitrogen profile of DPN gate dielectric can be engineered primarily by tuning the plasma pressure after optimizing other DPN process parameters to solve these problems. An EOT of 15 /spl Aring/ (23-/spl Aring/ NMOS CETinv) DPN oxynitride is demonstrated to have an acceptable pMOS Vt, comparable transconductance, significantly (/spl sim/30/spl times/) longer pMOS time-to-breakdown reliability for packaged devices, and 5/spl times/ gate leakage reduction relative to a high quality RTONO used in industry. The high quality ultrathin DPN film is fabricated in a commercially available system, which is compatible with standard CMOS processing technology.

By utilizing branch voltages as state variables, a constant Jacobian matrix can be obtained, and a building algorithm for Jacobian matrix is then developed from the observation of the constant Jacobian matrix. A solution technique, which takes the network structure into account to avoid the time-consuming lower and upper triangular (LU) factorization, is also developed. Since the factorization procedure can be avoided, the proposed method can save computation time. For any power system equipment, if its equivalent current injection or admittance matrix can be obtained, it can be integrated into the proposed method. Test results demonstrate that by integrating the Jacobian building algorithm and efficient solution technique, the proposed method is an effective three-phase load flow method and has great potential for real-time use.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2002.805012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1137618","","Load flow;Voltage;Jacobian matrices;Power system planning;Power system analysis computing;Power system modeling;Buildings;Power systems;Admittance;Testing","power distribution control;load flow control;control system synthesis;Newton-Raphson method;Jacobian matrices;control system analysis","unbalanced radial distribution systems;three-phase load flow control algorithm;Newton-Raphson algorithm;state variables;branch voltages;Jacobian matrix;computation time;equivalent current injection;admittance matrix","","60","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Some history and more recent results are discussed along with a description of the present interpretations of the active mass transport mechanisms involved in Cu electromigration. The issue of the dual-damascene process and its potential effect on EM reliability is described with special focus on the peculiarities of the dual-damascene interconnect architecture compared to more conventional subtractively etched Al-based interconnects. Experiments performed on dual-damascene interconnects that highlight electromigration reliability issues such as early failure, a tentative explanation for via electromigration failure, and the Blech effect, are summarized. Emphasis is placed on an experimental methodology that uses large interconnect ensembles in a multi-link configuration. Such a large scale study of nearly 10000 interconnects has shown statistical evidence of bimodal failure behavior consistent with the presence of a weak and strong failure mode, which have been identified as voiding, respectively, within the via and the trench at the cathode end of an interconnect. A multi-link approach has also demonstrated a length-dependent distribution of failures that yields a (j/spl middot/L)/sub c/ product value of about 9000 A/cm in dual-damascene Cu/oxide interconnections and is consistent with mass transport that is controlled by the presence of extended defects within Cu such as grain boundaries, interfaces, and/or surfaces.

Originally, code smells are used to find the places in software that could benefit from refactoring. In this paper we investigate how the quality of code can be automatically assessed by checking for the presence of code smells and how this approach can contribute to automatic code inspection. We present an approach for the automatic detection and visualization of code smells and discuss how this approach can be used in the design of a software inspection tool.

Focus is made on a new measuring system for the digital acquisition of PD-pulse signals, which operates at a sampling rate high enough to avoid the frequency aliasing, but that provides an amount of PD pulses which enables PD stochastic analysis. A separation and classification method, based on a fuzzy classifier, is developed for the analysis of the acquired PD-pulse shape signals. The result of the fuzzy classification is a cluster of signals homogeneous in terms of stochastic features of PD pulses. The classification efficiency is evaluated resorting to the PD-pulse height and phase distributions analysis. The instrumentation, and the associated classification methodology, are applied to measure and analyze PD data recorded for mica-insulated stator bars and coils, where typical defects, occurring during normal operations, were simulated. It is shown that the proposed procedure enables PD-source identification to solve the identification problems which arise, in particular, when different sources of PD are simultaneously active.

Lower annealing temperatures would further launch wafer bonding as a competitive technology and enable a wider use of it. Oxygen plasma treatment has been proven to be very feasible in achieving a strong bonding already at low temperatures. It was also seen that in our experimental setups the results depended on what plasma parameters that were used, since different plasma parameters create different surface conditions.","1558-4542","","10.1109/2944.991407","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=991407","","Plasma temperature;Wafer bonding;Optical materials;Semiconductor materials;Plasma materials processing;Silicon;Lattices;Plasma devices;Plasma applications;Plasma properties","indium compounds;III-V semiconductors;silicon;wafer bonding;annealing;optoelectronic devices;optical fabrication;sputter etching","plasma-assisted InP-to-Si low temperature wafer bonding;dissimilar material system;InP-based optoelectronic devices;annealing temperature;plasma-assisted bonding;review;annealing temperatures;competitive technology;oxygen plasma treatment;strong bonding;plasma parameters surface conditions;InP-Si","","154","","84","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Even for a fixed source impedance, the integrated LNA can achieve near NF/sub min/ by choosing an appropriate device geometry along with an optimal bias condition. An 800 MHz LNA has been implemented in a standard 0.24 /spl mu/m CMOS technology.

The comparison has been performed on two classes of circuits, the former with minimum transistor size to minimize power consumption, the latter with optimized transistor dimension to minimize power-delay product. The investigation has been carried out with properly defined simulation runs on a Cadence environment using a 0.35-/spl mu/m process, also including the parasitics derived from layout. Performance has been also compared for different supply voltage values. Thus design guidelines have been derived to select the most suitable topology for the design features required. This paper also proposes a novel figure of merit to realistically compare n-bit adders implemented as a chain of one-bit full adders. The results differ from those previously published both for the more realistic simulations carried out and the more appropriate figure of merit used. They show that, except for short chains of blocks or for cases where minimum power consumption is desired, topologies with only pass transistors or transmission gates are not attractive. In contrast, the most interesting implementations in terms of trade off between power and delay are the traditional CMOS and mirror topologies.

Since the distance, d, between adjacent elements of the array is small d/spl Lt//spl lambda//sub o/, the slot array essentially becomes a uniform LWA. A comprehensive transmission line model is developed based upon the theory of truncated periodic transmission lines to explain the operation of the antenna and provide a tool for its design. Measured and simulated radiation patterns, directivity, gain, and an associated loss budget are presented for a 32-element antenna operating at 30 GHz.

A neural network has the advantage of very fast implementation of an SVM algorithm, particularly when a dedicated application-specific IC chip is used instead of a digital signal processor (DSP). A three-level inverter has a large number of switching states compared to a two-level inverter and, therefore, the SVM algorithm to be implemented in a neural network is considerably more complex. In the proposed scheme, a three-layer feedforward neural network receives the command voltage and angle information at the input and generates symmetrical pulsewidth modulation waves for the three phases with the help of a single timer and simple logic circuits. The artificial-neural-network (ANN)-based modulator distributes switching states such that neutral-point voltage is balanced in an open-loop manner. The frequency and voltage can be varied from zero to full value in the whole undermodulation range. A simulated DSP-based modulator generates the data which are used to train the network by a backpropagation algorithm in the MATLAB Neural Network Toolbox. The performance of an open-loop volts/Hz speed-controlled induction motor drive has been evaluated with the ANN-based modulator and compared with that of a conventional DSP-based modulator, and shows excellent performance. The modulator can be easily applied to a vector-controlled drive, and its performance can be extended to the overmodulation region.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2002.1003415","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1003415","","Space vector pulse width modulation;Voltage;Support vector machines;Pulse width modulation inverters;Neural networks;Artificial neural networks;Signal processing algorithms;Application specific integrated circuits;Digital integrated circuits;Digital signal processors","induction motor drives;PWM invertors;machine control;neurocontrollers;application specific integrated circuits;switching circuits;feedforward neural nets;backpropagation;angular velocity control;machine vector control;frequency control;voltage control","neural-network-based space-vector modulation;neural-network-based space-vector PWM controller;three-level voltage-fed inverter;induction motor drive;linear undermodulation region;SVM algorithm;application-specific IC chip;switching states;three-layer feedforward neural network;command voltage;angle information;symmetrical pulsewidth modulation waves;three phase;timer;logic circuits;artificial-neural-network;neutral-point voltage balancing;backpropagation algorithm;MATLAB Neural Network Toolbox;open-loop volts/Hz speed-control","","87","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This filter, typically a series inductance, acts to reduce the switching harmonics entering the distribution network. An alternative filter is a LCL network, which can achieve reduced levels of harmonic distortion at lower switching frequencies and with less inductance, and therefore has potential benefits for higher power applications. However, systems incorporating LCL filters require more complex control strategies and are not commonly presented in literature. This paper proposes a robust strategy for regulating the grid current entering a distribution network from a three-phase VSI system connected via an LCL filter. The strategy integrates an outer loop grid current regulator with inner capacitor current regulation to stabilise the system. A synchronous frame PI current regulation strategy is used for the outer grid current control loop. Linear analysis, simulation and experimental results are used to verify the stability of the control algorithm across a range of operating conditions. Finally, expressions for ""harmonic impedance"" of the system are derived to study the effects of supply voltage distortion on the harmonic performance of the system.","","0-7803-7262-X","10.1109/PSEC.2002.1022337","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1022337","","Current control;Inverters;Power harmonic filters;Inductance;Harmonic distortion;Power electronics;Automatic voltage control;Distributed control;Switching frequency;Control systems","invertors;electric current control;two-term control;harmonics suppression;robust control;power system harmonics;power harmonic filters;power system control","three-phase voltage source inverter;LCL input filter;grid connected power electronic systems;STATCOM;UPFC;series inductance;switching harmonics reduction;LCL network;harmonic distortion;lower switching frequencies;control strategies;grid current regulation;robust strategy;distribution network;three-phase VSI system;LCL filter;outer loop grid current regulator;inner capacitor current regulation;synchronous frame PI current regulation;outer grid current control loop;linear analysis;operating conditions;harmonic impedance;supply voltage distortion;harmonic performance","","31","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to the asymmetric filtering characteristics, the designs often include diagonal cross-couplings between nonadjacent resonators in addition to the usual ""straight"" couplings. Diagonal couplings tend to be mechanically difficult to manufacture and assemble and can be electrically awkward to tune and be sensitive to temperature, vibration, etc., all of which drives up unit costs.

Then, a single phase three-level PFC circuit is presented based on the three-level boost topology, and the principle and implementation approaches of the three-level PFC circuit are described. To realize the soft switching of the main switches and freewheeling diodes, two passive lossless snubber cells are added to the circuit.

Three alternative control strategies are evaluated to increase the penetration level of EWG: EWG generation curtailment during low demand; reactive power management using a reactive compensator; and area-based OLTC co-ordinated voltage control. The application of these schemes is illustrated on a rurally connected 11 kV wind farm in a realistic 265-node generic distribution system model.

The motivation behind the design, the fabrication approach, and the experimental characterization are presented for two classes of devices. The first design involves multiple parallel channels with integrated filter structures to incorporate standard catalytic materials. These catalysts are in the form of finely divided porous particles in a packed-bed arrangement. The second device involves the incorporation of porous silicon as a catalyst support, in the form of a thin layer covering microstructured channels. These microstructured channels simulate the structure of a packed bed and enhance mass transfer relative to an open channel. The ability to incorporate features at the tens-of-microns scale can reduce the mass-transfer limitations by promoting mixing and dispersion for the multiple phases. Directly integrating the catalyst support structures into the channels of the microreactor allows the precise definition of the bed properties, including the support's size, shape and arrangement, and the void fraction. Such a design would find broad applicability in enhancing the transport and active surface area for sensing, chemical, and biochemical conversion devices. Reaction rates for the gas-liquid-solid hydrogenation of cyclohexene using the integrated catalyst with porous silicon as a support compare favorably to those rates obtained with the packed-bed approach. In both cases, the mass transfer coefficient is at least 100 times better than conventional laboratory reactors.","1941-0158","","10.1109/JMEMS.2002.803416","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1097791","","Fabrication;Microfluidics;Silicon;Inductors;Chemical technology;Filters;Micromechanical devices;Chemical reactors;Chemical analysis;Chemical processes","mixing;microfluidics;chemical technology;catalysis;mass transfer;multiphase flow","microfluidic device;multiphase mixing;multiphase reaction;porous particles;silicon microfabrication technology;microchemical device;heterogeneous catalysis;integrated filter;packed bed;porous silicon support;microstructured channel;mass transfer;gas-liquid-solid hydrogenation;cyclohexene;integrated catalyst;Si","","152","","46","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Third, a hidden Markov model (HMM) is employed for shape recognition to label and rank the character candidates. For this purpose, a string of codes is extracted from each segment to represent the character candidates. The estimation of feature space parameters is embedded in the HMM training stage together with the estimation of the HMM model parameters. Finally, information from a lexicon and from the HMM ranks is combined in a graph optimization problem for word-level recognition.

Many kinds of inverter circuits and their control schemes for photovoltaic (PV) power generation systems have been studied. In a conventional system, the PV array in which many PV modules are connected in series is used to obtain sufficient DC-bus voltage for generating an AC utility line voltage from an inverter circuit. However, the total power generation of the PV array is sometimes decreased remarkably when a few modules are partially covered by shadows, thereby decreasing its inherent current generation, and preventing the generation current attaining its maximum value on the array. To overcome this drawback, an AC module strategy has been proposed. In this system, a small power DC-AC utility interactive inverter is mounted on each PV module individually. This inverter operates so as to generate the maximum power from its corresponding PV module. This paper proposes a novel flyback-type utility interactive inverter circuit suitable for AC module systems. The features of the proposed system are that it: (1) is small in volume and lightweight; (2) allows stable AC current injection into the utility line; (3) enables the stable parallel operation without AC current sharing control; and (4) enables the capacitance of the DC capacitor to be small. The effectiveness of the proposed system is clarified through simulation and experiments.","","0-7803-7262-X","10.1109/PSEC.2002.1022385","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1022385","","Inverters;Photovoltaic systems;Solar power generation;Circuits;Power generation;Control systems;Voltage;AC generators;Lighting control;Capacitance","photovoltaic power systems;solar cell arrays;DC-AC power convertors;invertors;power system interconnection","PV power systems;flyback-type single-phase utility interactive inverter;solar arrays;photovoltaic power generation systems;PV array;AC module strategy;DC-AC utility interactive inverter;stable parallel operation;DC capacitor","","92","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two types of anomaly detection are of interest and considered in this paper. One was previously developed by Reed and Yu to detect targets whose signatures are distinct from their surroundings. Another was designed to detect targets with low probabilities in an unknown image scene. Interestingly, they both operate the same form as does a matched filter. Moreover, they can be implemented in real-time processing, provided that the sample covariance matrix is replaced by the sample correlation matrix. One disadvantage of an anomaly detector is the lack of ability to discriminate the detected targets from another. In order to resolve this problem, the concept of target discrimination measures is introduced to cluster different types of anomalies into separate target classes. By using these class means as target information, the detected anomalies can be further classified. With inclusion of target discrimination in anomaly detection, anomaly classification can be implemented in a three-stage process, first by anomaly detection to find potential targets, followed by target discrimination to cluster the detected anomalies into separate target classes, and concluded by a classifier to achieve target classification. Experiments show that anomaly classification performs very differently from anomaly detection.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2002.800280","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1020263","","Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Detectors;Covariance matrix;Signal processing;Image analysis;Matched filters;Object detection;Image sensors;Layout","geophysical techniques;geophysical signal processing;terrain mapping;image classification;feature extraction;multidimensional signal processing","geophysical measurement technique;land surface;terrain mapping;multispectral remote sensing;visible;IR;infrared;feature extraction;anomaly detection;image classification;hyperspectral imagery;hyperspectral image analysis;spectral signature;covariance matrix;correlation matrix;target class;Bhattacharyya distance;causal RXD;Mahalanobis distance","","253","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Capacitive filtering, however, also substantially reduces the phase noise at high offset frequencies and may therefore become a valid alternative to inductive degeneration, as discrete capacitors are of more common use than discrete inductors.","1558-173X","","10.1109/4.987086","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=987086","","Tail;Radio frequency;Voltage-controlled oscillators;Phase noise;Low-frequency noise;Circuit noise;Filtering;Capacitors;Switches;Noise generators","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;radiofrequency oscillators;voltage-controlled oscillators;phase noise;integrated circuit noise","RF CMOS VCO;inductive degeneration;capacitive filtering;phase noise;low-frequency tail current noise suppression","","92","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The paths are optimized to account for uncertainty/adversaries in the environment by modeling the probability of UAV loss. The approach extends prior work by coupling the failure probabilities for each UAV to the selected missions for all other UAVs. In order to maximize the expected mission score, this stochastic formulation designs coordination plans that optimally exploit the coupling effects of cooperation between UAVs to improve survival probabilities. This allocation is shown to recover real-world air operations planning strategies, and to provide significant improvements over approaches that do not correctly account for UAV attrition. The algorithm is implemented in an approximate decomposition approach that uses straight-line paths to estimate the time-of-flight and risk for each mission. The task allocation for the UAVs is then posed as a mixed-integer linear program that can be solved using CPLEX.","0191-2216","0-7803-7516-5","10.1109/CDC.2002.1184270","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1184270","","Path planning;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Stochastic processes;Strategic planning;Aerodynamics;Aircraft;Risk management;Contracts;Resource management;Cost function","aircraft control;path planning;cooperative systems;integer programming;linear programming;probability","unmanned aerial vehicles;cooperative path planning;failure probability;survival probability;time-of flight;integer programming;optimization;linear programming","","99","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Enz","Swiss Center for Electron. & Microtechnology, Neuchatel, Switzerland","IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","","2002","50","1","342","359","This paper presents an overview of MOS transistor modeling for RF integrated circuit design. It starts with the description of a physical equivalent circuit that can easily be implemented as a SPICE subcircuit. The MOS transistor is divided into an intrinsic part, representing mainly the active part of the device, and an extrinsic part responsible for most of the parasitic elements. A complete charge-based model of the intrinsic part is presented. The main advantage of this new charge-based model is to provide a simple and coherent description of the DC, AC, nonquasi-static (NQS), and noise behavior of the intrinsic MOS that is valid in all regions of operation. It is based on the forward and reverse charges q/sub f/ and q/sub r/ defined as the mobile charge densities, evaluated at the source and at the drain. This intrinsic model also includes a new simplified NQS model that uses a bias and frequency normalization allowing one to describe the high-order frequency behavior with only two simple functions. The extrinsic model includes all the terminal access series resistances, and particularly the gate resistance, the overlap, and junction capacitances as well as a substrate network. The latter is required to account for the signal coupling occurring at RF from the drain to the source and the bulk, through the junction capacitances. The noise model is then presented, including the effect of the substrate resistances on the RF noise parameters. All the aspects of the model are validated for a 0.25-/spl mu/m CMOS process.","1557-9670","","10.1109/22.981286","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=981286","","Integrated circuit modeling;MOSFETs;Radio frequency;Radiofrequency integrated circuits;Capacitance;Semiconductor device modeling;Integrated circuit synthesis;Equivalent circuits;SPICE;RF signals","MOSFET;semiconductor device models;CMOS integrated circuits;integrated circuit design;UHF integrated circuits;field effect MMIC;integrated circuit noise;semiconductor device noise;equivalent circuits;capacitance;integrated circuit modelling","MOS transistor modeling;RF integrated circuits;RFIC design;physical equivalent circuit;SPICE subcircuit;parasitic elements;charge-based model;noise behavior;mobile charge densities;bias normalization;frequency normalization;high-order frequency behavior;extrinsic model;intrinsic model;terminal access series resistances;gate resistance;junction capacitances;substrate network;signal coupling;overlap capacitances;noise model;substrate resistances;RF noise parameters;CMOS process;Y-parameters;transit frequency;RF large-signal characteristics;MOSFETs;semiconductor device modeling;0.25 micron","","122","","59","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Insulating materials can be divided into simple polymers and composites. Polymers for power cables, transformers, insulators and rotating machines consist of thermoplastics such as PE, PET and PPS, elastomers such as silicone, EPR and EPDM, and thermosets such as epoxy. Composites for GIS, rotating machines and insulators comprise epoxy/glass, epoxy/silica/alumina, and epoxy/mica systems. Aging processes are complicated in general, and take place under simultaneous multiple stresses such as electrical, thermal, mechanical and environmental stresses. Some of the phenomena covered in this paper are associated with the degradation by tracking and erosion and the loss of hydrophobicity in case of surface properties, and with PD, electrical treeing, water treeing and combined phenomena. The quality of cable insulation such as XLPE has been improved extensively from the standpoint of design electric strength. Interfacial problems will emerge for modification of cable joints.

A converter with the proposed snubber cell can also operate at light load conditions. All of the semiconductor devices in this converter are turned on and off under exact or near zero voltage switching (ZVS) and/or zero current switching (ZCS). No additional voltage and current stresses on the main switch and main diode occur. Also, the auxiliary switch and auxiliary diodes are subjected to voltage and current values at allowable levels. Moreover, the converter has a simple structure, low cost, and ease of control. A ZVT-PWM boost converter equipped with the proposed snubber cell is analyzed in detail. The predicted operation principles and theoretical analysis of the presented converter are verified with a prototype of a 2 kW and 50 kHz PWM boost converter with insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT). In this study, a design procedure of the proposed active snubber cell is also presented. Additionally, at full output power in the proposed soft switching converter, the main switch loss is about 27% and the total circuit loss is about 36% of that in its counterpart hard switching converter, and so the overall efficiency, which is about 91% in the hard switching case, increases to about 97%.","1941-0107","","10.1109/63.988668","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=988668","","DC-DC power converters;Switches;Snubbers;Switching converters;Zero voltage switching;Zero current switching;Semiconductor diodes;Insulated gate bipolar transistors;Switching circuits;Semiconductor devices","DC-DC power convertors;PWM power convertors;snubbers;insulated gate bipolar transistors;switching circuits","ZVT-PWM DC-DC converter;active snubber cell;light load conditions;near zero voltage switching;zero current switching;ZCS;ZVS;auxiliary switch;auxiliary diodes;operation principles;insulated gate bipolar transistor;IGBT;main switch loss;total circuit loss;2 kW;50 kHz;91 percent;97 percent","","105","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A review of the phase unwrapping problem is given. Different structures, in particular fringelines, cutlines, and poles, contained within a phase map are described and their origin and behavior investigated. The problem of phase unwrapping can then be addressed with a better understanding of the source of poles or inconsistencies. This understanding, along with some assumptions about what is being encoded in the phase of a magnetic resonance image, are used to derive a new method for phase unwrapping which relies only on the phase map. The method detects cutlines and distinguishes between noise-induced poles and signal undersampling poles based on the length of the fringelines. The method was shown to be robust to noise and successful in unwrapping challenging clinical cases.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2002.803106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1076041","","Magnetic resonance imaging;Physics;Magnetic noise;Wrapping;Astronomy;Magnetic resonance;Noise robustness;Signal processing;Blood flow;Radiology","biomedical MRI;medical image processing;noise","MRI phase maps understanding;magnetic resonance imaging;medical diagnostic imaging;undersampling poles;signal undersampling poles;inconsistencies source;image encoding;fringelines length;challenging clinical cases;noise robust method","Algorithms;Blood Flow Velocity;Body Surface Potential Mapping;Computer Simulation;Coronary Circulation;Heart;Heart;Humans;Image Enhancement;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Motion;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Stochastic Processes","106","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

During a summer research experience, two electrical engineering juniors at USD wrote a tutorial on LabVIEW and designed a one-hour exercise to introduce students to LabVIEW. The exercise allowed students to obtain the amplitude frequency response of a simple RC circuit using a function generator and an oscilloscope. Students had previously done this experiment manually in their sophomore circuits' class. Thus the concepts of the lab were familiar and they could focus on the advantages of having LabVIEW automate the data acquisition and analysis.

Furthermore, because of the exploratory nature of the analysis, it must be possible for the analysts to change visualizations rapidly as they pursue a cycle involving first hypothesis and then experimentation. In this paper, we present Polaris, an interface for exploring large multidimensional databases that extends the well-known pivot table interface. The novel features of Polaris include an interface for constructing visual specifications of table-based graphical displays and the ability to generate a precise set of relational queries from the visual specifications.

The flat interface nerve electrode (FINE) reshapes the nerve into a flat geometry to increase the surface area and move central axon populations close to the surface. The electrode was implanted acutely on the sciatic nerve of eight cats. The FINE can significantly reshape the nerve and fascicles (p<0.0001) while maintaining the same total nerve cross-sectional area. The stimulation thresholds were 2.89 nC for pulse amplitude modulation and 10.2 nC for pulsewidth modulation. Monopolar, square-pulse stimulation with single contacts on the FINE selectively recruited each of the four main branches of the sciatic nerve.

"Geomagnetically induced current effects on transformers","P. R. Price","Infraco Sub Surface Ltd., London, UK","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","","2002","17","4","1002","1008","Geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) can cause saturation of the magnetic circuit of transformers in a power system. This saturation can increase the MVAr absorption of the transformers, leading to voltage-control problems, generating significant harmonic currents, and cause heating of the internal components of the transformer itself, leading to gas relay alarm/operation as well as possible damage. This paper sets out the methods used to examine these effects using a mathematical model explicitly incorporating the electric and magnetic circuits, including the shunting effect of the tank to predict the current and flux waveforms. The model has been used to predict GIC effects for a variety of winding connections for single-, three-, and five-limb core-type transformers connected to the National Grid Company plc transmission system in England and Wales. The size and form of the return limbs along with the tank shunting effect determine the magnitude and the often complex shape of the waveforms resulting from GIC. Field and factory DC injection tests on various types of transformers have been conducted to validate the model and gain an insight into the magnetic behavior of transformers. With the aid of finite-element analysis (FEA) techniques and a consideration of the various constructional arrangements of the core and coils in the tank, it is possible to evaluate the power losses and accompanying temperature rises of the core, structural components, windings, and tank. Some guidance on the acceptable GIC current levels for various transformer types is given.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2002.803710","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1046876","","Transformer cores;Magnetic cores;Magnetic circuits;Power system harmonics;Power system relaying;Absorption;Heating;Mathematical model;Predictive models;Programmable control","power transformers;geomagnetism;transformer magnetic circuits;finite element analysis;magnetisation;transformer cores","geomagnetically induced current;magnetic circuit saturation;voltage-control;harmonic currents;internal components heating;gas relay alarm/operation;mathematical model;electric circuits;tank shunting effect;flux waveforms prediction;current waveforms prediction;DC injection tests;finite-element analysis;coils;power losses;structural components;power transformers;National Grid Company;transmission system;magnetizing current;five-limb core-type transformers;single-limb core-type transformers;three-limb core-type transformers;winding connections","","98","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hand postures are represented in terms of hierarchies of multi-scale colour image features at different scales, with qualitative inter-relations in terms of scale, position and orientation. In each image, detection of multi-scale colour features is performed. Hand states are then simultaneously detected and tracked using particle filtering, with an extension of layered sampling referred to as hierarchical layered sampling.

The reasons for the different amplitudes of the two adjacent tones are first investigated under small- and large-signal regimes, using a general circuit with frequency-dependent embedding impedances and resistive and reactive nonlinearities. It is shown that this intriguing phenomenon can be mainly attributed to the terminating impedances at the baseband or difference frequencies. Multitone behavior is also addressed and its main differences from the two-tone case explained.

Eng., Stanford Univ., CA, USA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Reliability","","2002","51","1","63","75","This paper proposes a pure software technique ""error detection by duplicated instructions"" (EDDI), for detecting errors during usual system operation. Compared to other error-detection techniques that use hardware redundancy, EDDI does not require any hardware modifications to add error detection capability to the original system. EDDI duplicates instructions during compilation and uses different registers and variables for the new instructions. Especially for the fault in the code segment of memory, formulas are derived to estimate the error-detection coverage of EDDI using probabilistic methods. These formulas use statistics of the program, which are collected during compilation. EDDI was applied to eight benchmark programs and the error-detection coverage was estimated. Then, the estimates were verified by simulation, in which a fault injector forced a bit-flip in the code segment of executable machine codes. The simulation results validated the estimated fault coverage and show that approximately 1.5% of injected faults produced incorrect results in eight benchmark programs with EDDI, while on average, 20% of injected faults produced undetected incorrect results in the programs without EDDI. Based on the theoretical estimates and actual fault-injection experiments, EDDI can provide over 98% fault-coverage without any extra hardware for error detection. This pure software technique is especially useful when designers cannot change the hardware, but they need dependability in the computer system. To reduce the performance overhead, EDDI schedules the instructions that are added for detecting errors such that ""instruction-level parallelism"" (ILP) is maximized. Performance overhead can be reduced by increasing ILP within a single super-scalar processor. The execution time overhead in a 4-way super-scalar processor is less than the execution time overhead in the processors that can issue two instructions in one cycle.","1558-1721","","10.1109/24.994913","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=994913","","Hardware;Fault detection;Computer errors;Single event upset;Event detection;Parallel processing;Error correction;Computer architecture;Redundancy;Registers","error detection;instruction sets;parallel architectures;software fault tolerance;software reliability","software technique;error detection by duplicated instructions;super-scalar processors;system operation;registers;instructions duplication;memory code segment fault;error-detection coverage;probabilistic methods;error-detection coverage estimation;fault-coverage;performance overhead reduction;instruction-level parallelism;execution time overhead;concurrent error detection;fault tolerance;single event upset;instruction-scheduling;transient fault","","332","","42","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"A review of speckle filtering in the context of estimation theory","R. Touzi","Natural Resources Canada, Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, Ottawa, Ont., Canada","IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","2002","40","11","2392","2404","Speckle filter performance depends strongly on the speckle and scene models used as the basis for filter development. These models implicitly incorporate certain assumptions about speckle, scene, and observed signals. In this study, the multiplicative and the product speckle models, which have been used for the development of most of the well-known filters, are analyzed, and their implicit assumptions with regard to the stationarity-nonstationarity nature of speckle are discussed. This leads to the definition of two categories of speckle filters: the stationary and the nonstationary multiplicative speckle model filters. The various approximate models used for the multiplicative speckle noise model are assessed as functions of speckle and scene characteristics to derive the requirements on scene signal variations for the validity of both the stationary and nonstationary multiplicative speckle models. Speckle filtering is then studied in the context of estimation theory, so as to develop a procedure for speckle filtering. It is shown that speckle filtering can be effective only in locally stationary scenes. Regions in which the signals are not stationary have to be filtered separately using a priori scene templates for the best matching of nonstationary scene features. The use of multiresolution techniques is crucial for accurate estimation of filter parameters. Under the guidance of the speckle filtering procedure, structural-multiresolution versions of the Lee (1980) and Frost et al. (1982) filters are developed for optimum application of these filters in the context of nonstationary scene signals.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2002.803727","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1166598","","Speckle;Filtering theory;Estimation theory;Filters;Layout;Signal processing;Additive noise;Spatial resolution;Signal resolution;Gaussian noise","synthetic aperture radar;reviews;estimation theory;radar theory;radar signal processing","speckle filtering;review;estimation theory;synthetic aperture radar;SAR;texture;edge detection;multiresolution nonstationary signal;point target detection;filter development;stationary speckle model filters;nonstationary multiplicative speckle model filters;multiplicative speckle noise model;nonstationary scene features;multiresolution techniques;filter parameters;nonstationary scene signals","","230","","55","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A threshold energy of 440 keV was observed, corresponding to a gallium atom displacement energy of 19/spl plusmn/2 eV. This value of the displacement energy compares with that of silicon carbide but is smaller than that of diamond and larger than that of gallium arsenide (GaAs). No threshold energy for the nitrogen atom was observed. It is concluded that the nitrogen sublattice repairs itself through annealing. The measured displacement energy is used to determine the Rutherford cross section, which permits a theoretical comparison of electron and proton irradiation damage in GaN. The effects of 2.5 MeV electrons on gallium nitride films have been studied by photoluminescence (PL), and according to the literature, they introduce transitions in the near infrared part of the spectrum. Experiments on gallium nitride films using 2 MeV protons are reported in this work. The same transitions in the near infrared part of the spectrum are observed by PL. It is deduced that 2 MeV protons are about 1000 times more damaging than 2.5 MeV electrons. The Rutherford cross section predicts a value of 214. The difference is attributed to the defect recombination rate which depends on the particle type. The nature of the transitions in the near infrared part of the spectrum is reviewed. The GaN films were annealed at 400/spl deg/C for 30 min. As a result of annealing, another transition appears in the green part of the spectrum.

The cross section of the shape boundary is modeled as a step function. We first derive a one-dimensional (1-D) optimal step edge operator, which minimizes both the noise power and the mean squared error between the input and the filter output. This operator is found to be the derivative of the double exponential (DODE) function, originally derived by Ben-Arie and Rao (1994). We define an operator for shape detection by extending the DODE filter along the shape's boundary contour. The responses are accumulated at the centroid of the operator to estimate the likelihood of the presence of the given shape. This method of detecting a shape is in fact a natural extension of the task of edge detection at the pixel level to the problem of global contour detection. This simple filtering scheme also provides a tool for a systematic analysis of edge-based shape detection. We investigate how the error is propagated by the shape geometry. We have found that, under general assumptions, the operator is locally linear at the peak of the response. We compute the expected shape of the response and derive some of its statistical properties. This enables us to predict both its localization and detection performance and adjust its parameters according to imaging conditions and given performance specifications.

In electric vehicle (EV) applications high efficiency of the drive over a wide speed range, wide torque bandwidth, and low torque ripple under varying DC-bus voltage conditions are important design goals. Hence, controllers of switched reluctance drives for EVs usually have a complex structure. In this paper, the demands on control accuracy of switched reluctance machine traction drives and the traction controller sampling frequency, which are necessary to take advantage of the switched reluctance machine dynamic capabilities, are discussed. To integrate the traction drive, the control commands need to be actualized with a sampling frequency of at least 100 Hz to meet the high-dynamic requirements of modern vehicle control systems, e.g., active cruise control, antislip control, and active damping of mechanical drivetrain oscillations. It is found that the switching angles have to be adjusted within one-tenth of a mechanical degree.

This leads to a large coding gain, comparable to that of turbo TCM, over both Gaussian and Rayleigh fading channels with much less system complexity.

A technique is proposed for extracting the equivalent circuit parameters of the inductor and determining the frequency-dependent effective rod permeability as well as the intrinsic permeability of the ferrite-core material. The equivalent series resistance, inductance, and the lumped shunt parasitic capacitance have been calculated versus frequency for a slug-type inductor and a toroidal-type inductor. The effective rod permeability of the ferrite rod used in the slug-type inductor and the intrinsic permeability of the ferrite core used in the toroidal-type inductor have also been estimated as a function of frequency. The calculated intrinsic permeability of the toroidal core agrees very well with that measured by the HP4291A RF Material Analyzer. The proposed method is simple and accurate.

In controlled airspace, such a UAV would have to interact with other vehicles moving though its environment. The locations of obstacles (other vehicles) that form obstructions in the environment may only be known with limited accuracy. Evolutionary algorithms (EA) have been successfully used to compute near-optimal paths through obstructed, dynamically changing environments. Explicitly accounting for the uncertainty of the obstacles can result in the survival of ""best"" paths which differ from those that would be favored in a purely deterministic environment. In this paper, we consider the application of evolution-based path planning to the motion of an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) through a field of obstacles at uncertain locations. We begin with the static form of the EA algorithm for generating a path at a single point in time. We describe the algorithm and show its behavior, specifically how it responds differently based on the known accuracy of the predictions of the environment. We then show how the static structure can be extended to consider the uncertainties which change with time. We demonstrate by application to path planning through a field of moving obstacles whose future motion is uncertain.","","0-7803-7367-7","10.1109/DASC.2002.1052946","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1052946","","Path planning;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Uncertainty;Military aircraft;Remotely operated vehicles;Evolutionary computation;Accuracy;Trajectory;Search methods;Vehicle dynamics","remotely operated vehicles;aircraft control;aircraft navigation;aerospace simulation;uncertainty handling;path planning;evolutionary computation","unmanned air vehicles;air vehicle autonomous motion;uncertain environments;evolution-based path planning;adaptive/intelligent on-board path planning;autonomous UAV;controlled airspace;obstacle location accuracy/uncertainty;obstructions;evolutionary algorithms;EA;near-optimal path computation;obstructed/dynamically changing environments;deterministic methods;environment predictions;future motion uncertain moving obstacles","","60","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using a reflection phase gradient, the surface can steer a reflected beam. As an example, we have built a simple mechanically tuned surface in which physical motion of only 1/100 wavelength generates a sufficient phase gradient to steer a reflected beam by /spl plusmn/16 degrees. To steer to greater angles, the surface can be configured as an artificial microwave grating, capable of /spl plusmn/38 degrees of beam steering.

Existing Naval condition assessment systems such as ICAS (Integrated Condition Assessment System) employ several fault detection and diagnostic technologies ranging from simple thresholding to rule-based algorithms. However, these technologies have not specifically focused on the ability to predict the future condition (prognostics) of a machine based on the current diagnostic state of the machinery and its available operating and failure history data. An advanced prognostic capability is desired because the ability to forecast this future condition enables a higher level of condition-based maintenance for optimally managing total life cycle costs (LCC). A second issue is that a framework does not exist for ""plug-and-play"" integration of new diagnostic and prognostic technologies into existing Naval platforms.

However, lack of structured coding schemes limited the practical application of these concepts so far. One of the basic elements of a network code is the binning scheme. Wyner (1974, 1978) and other researchers proposed various forms of coset codes for efficient binning, yet these schemes were applicable only for lossless source (or noiseless channel) network coding. To extend the algebraic binning approach to lossy source (or noisy channel) network coding, previous work proposed the idea of nested codes, or more specifically, nested parity-check codes for the binary case and nested lattices in the continuous case. These ideas connect network information theory with the rich areas of linear codes and lattice codes, and have strong potential for practical applications. We review these developments and explore their tight relation to concepts such as combined shaping and precoding, coding for memories with defects, and digital watermarking.

The technique is based on using the absolute sum value of coefficients in multiresolution signal decomposition (MSD) based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). A fault indicator and fault criteria are then used to detect the HIF in the transmission line. In order to discriminate between HIF and nonfault transient phenomena, such as capacitor and line switching and arc furnace loads, the concept of duration time (i.e., the transient time period), is presented. On the basis of extensive investigations, optimal mother wavelets for the detection of HIF are chosen. It is shown that the technique developed is robust to fault type, fault inception angle, fault resistance, and fault location. The paper demonstrates a new concept and methodology in HIF in transmission lines. The performance of the proposed technique is tested under a variety of fault conditions on a typical 154-kV Korean transmission-line system.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2002.803780","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1046864","","Transmission lines;Wavelet transforms;Discrete wavelet transforms;Signal resolution;Power system transients;Fault detection;Capacitors;Furnaces;Robustness;Fault location","power transmission lines;power transmission faults;capacitor switching;fault location;electric impedance;discrete wavelet transforms;arcs (electric)","Korean transmission-line system;fault-detection technique;high-impedance arcing faults;transmission lines;wavelet transform;absolute sum value of coefficients;multiresolution signal decomposition;discrete wavelet transform;fault indicator;fault criteria;nonfault transient phenomena;capacitor switching;line switching;arc furnace loads;transient time period;optimal mother wavelets;fault inception angle;fault resistance;fault location;154 kV","","94","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The SiN pull-back is performed by using H/sub 3/PO/sub 4/ solution after trench etch (i.e. before liner oxidation). For comparison, DRAMs were fabricated by using various isolation methods including LOCOS, conventional STI, and poly-buffered STI (PB-STI). The SiN pull-back process is known for reducing ""divot"" around the top comer in conventional STI. Both LOCOS and PB-STI can result in ""divot"" free. It is also known that ""divot"" will degrade the inverse narrow width effect of pass transistor and result in ""double hump"". In our study, SiN pull-back in STI indeed eliminates ""double-hump"" in I/sub d/-V/sub g/ curves of pass transistors. The SiN pull-back also can result in better data retention of DRAM than if without pull-back, but comparable to LOCOS and PB-STI. The optimized window of SiN pull-back in this study is 10 nm to 40 nm with best yield at 15 nm (slightly better yield than LOCOS and PB-STI).","","0-7803-7158-5","10.1109/ASMC.2002.1001567","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1001567","","Robustness;Silicon compounds;Random access memory;Isolation technology;Semiconductor device manufacture;Oxidation;CMOS technology;Wet etching;Research and development;Time measurement","isolation technology;silicon compounds;DRAM chips;integrated circuit technology","shallow trench isolation;SiN pull-back process;DRAM technology;pass transistor;refresh time;yield;poly-buffered STI;LOCOS;data retention;divot;inverse narrow width effect;double hump;SiN","","5","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"HAMMER: hierarchical attribute matching mechanism for elastic registration","Dinggang Shen; C. Davatzikos","Dept. of Radiol., Johns Hopkins Univ.

Sch. of Med., Baltimore, MD, USA","IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","","2002","21","11","1421","1439","A new approach is presented for elastic registration of medical images, and is applied to magnetic resonance images of the brain. Experimental results demonstrate very high accuracy in superposition of images from different subjects. There are two major novelties in the proposed algorithm. First, it uses an attribute vector, i.e., a set of geometric moment invariants (GMIs) that are defined on each voxel in an image and are calculated from the tissue maps, to reflect the underlying anatomy at different scales. The attribute vector, if rich enough, can distinguish between different parts of an image, which helps establish anatomical correspondences in the deformation procedure; it also helps reduce local minima, by reducing ambiguity in potential matches. This is a fundamental deviation of our method, referred to as the hierarchical attribute matching mechanism for elastic registration (HAMMER), from other volumetric deformation methods, which are typically based on maximizing image similarity. Second, in order to avoid being trapped by local minima, i.e., suboptimal poor matches, HAMMER uses a successive approximation of the energy function being optimized by lower dimensional smooth energy functions, which are constructed to have significantly fewer local minima. This is achieved by hierarchically selecting the driving features that have distinct attribute vectors, thus, drastically reducing ambiguity in finding correspondence. A number of experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm results in accurate superposition of image data from individuals with significant anatomical differences.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2002.803111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1175091","","Biomedical imaging;Radiology;Anatomy;Image analysis;Biomedical computing;Magnetic resonance;Brain;Biomedical measurements;Neuroimaging;Aging","image registration;vectors;medical image processing;brain;image matching;biomedical MRI","average brain;deformable registration;geometric moment invariants;hierarchical deformation mechanism;multigrid formulation;statistical atlases;attribute vectors;volumetric deformation methods;accurate superposition;image data;significant anatomical differences;image voxel;lower dimensional smooth energy functions;local minima;suboptimal poor matches;distinct attribute vectors;hierarchical attribute matching mechanism for elastic registration;HAMMER","Aged;Algorithms;Atrophy;Brain;Brain;Elasticity;Humans;Image Enhancement;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Quality Control;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Stochastic Processes;Subtraction Technique","695","","52","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The statistical analysis of the calculated features indicates that they differ significantly between normal heart rhythm and the different arrhythmia types and, hence, can be rather useful in ECG arrhythmia detection. On the other hand, the results indicate that the discrimination between different arrhythmia types is difficult using such features.

We have investigated these two aspects but will concentrate on eye gaze estimation. We present a novel approach called the ""one-circle"" algorithm for measuring the eye gaze using a monocular image that zooms in on only one eye of a person. Observing that the iris contour is a circle, we estimate the normal direction of this iris circle, considered as the eye gaze, from its elliptical image. From basic projective geometry, an ellipse can be back-projected into space onto two circles of different orientations. However, by using a geometric constraint, namely, that the distance between the eyeball's center and the two eye corners should be equal to each other, the correct solution can be disambiguated. This allows us to obtain a higher resolution image of the iris with a zoom-in camera, thereby achieving higher accuracies in the estimation. A general approach that combines head pose determination with eye gaze estimation is also proposed. The searching of the eye gaze is guided by the head pose information. The robustness of our gaze determination approach was verified statistically by the extensive experiments on synthetic and real image data. The two key contributions are that we show the possibility of finding the unique eye gaze direction from a single image of one eye and that one can obtain better accuracy as a consequence of this.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2002.999809","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=999809","","Head;Humans;Iris;Robustness;Man machine systems;Sockets;Computer vision;Face;Joining processes;Mouth","user interfaces;interactive devices;image resolution;computational geometry;edge detection","eye gaze estimation;human visual line-of-sight;human head pose;eye orientation;one-circle algorithm;monocular image;iris contour;elliptical image;projective geometry;human-computer interaction;geometric constraint;image resolution;zoom-in camera;head pose determination;gaze determination;experiments","","95","","41","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The scheme is a nonadaptive DFE where the feedforward part is implemented in the frequency domain, while feedback signal is generated by time-domain filtering. Through simulations in a HIPERLAN-2 scenario, we show that FD-DFE yields a capacity very close to that of OFDM. This result is also confirmed by analytical derivations for a particular case. Furthermore, when no channel loading is considered, FD-DFE performs closely to OFDM for the same averaged frame error rate in a coded transmission. Design methods of the FD-DFE are investigated and a reduced complexity technique is developed, with the result that FD-DFE and OFDM have a similar computational complexity in signal processing.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2002.1010614","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1010614","","OFDM modulation;Decision feedback equalizers;Chirp modulation;Frequency modulation;Frequency division multiplexing;Frequency domain analysis;Signal generators;Time domain analysis;Filtering;Error analysis","OFDM modulation;decision feedback equalisers;computational complexity;feedforward;feedback;frequency-domain analysis;convolution;filtering theory","frequency-domain feedforward filter;OFDM;DFE;single carrier modulation;multicarrier modulation;frequency-domain linear equalization;frequency-domain decision feedback equalizer;FD-DFE;data block transmission format;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;cyclic prefix;nonadaptive DFE;feedback signal;time-domain filtering;simulations;HIPERLAN-2;capacity;channel loading;averaged frame error rate;coded transmission;reduced complexity technique;computational complexity;signal processing;circular convolution;linear convolution","","240","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper shows that unity power factor and low current distortion in all three phases can be realized by one-cycle control using one integrator with reset along with a few near and logic components. This new extension of one-cycle control provides the core PFC function to the dual-boost topologies. It does not require multipliers, as used in most other control approaches to scale the current reference according to the output power level. In each 60/spl deg/ of AC line cycle, only two switches are switched at high frequency; therefore the switching losses are significantly reduced. All switches are switched at low current, which results in reduced current ratings. This control method is simple and general. It is applicable to three-phase rectifiers that can be decoupled into parallel-connected dual-boost topologies by slight modification of the logic circuit. This control method is verified by experimental results. The proposed controller is suitable to be integrated into a three-phase PFC control chip.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2002.805582","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1158982","","Rectifiers;Reactive power;Power harmonic filters;Switches;Circuit topology;Voltage;Capacitors;Electric variables control;Logic;Frequency","rectifying circuits;power factor correction;switching circuits;losses;electric current control","parallel-connected dual boost topology;rectifiers;three-phase PFC controller;constant-frequency power-factor-correction controller;three-phase rectifiers;parallel-connected dual-boost topologies;unity power factor;low current distortion;AC line cycle;switching losses;logic circuit modification;three-phase PFC control chip","","65","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In our retrieval system, an image is represented by a set of segmented regions, each of which is characterized by a fuzzy feature (fuzzy set) reflecting color, texture, and shape properties. As a result, an image is associated with a family of fuzzy features corresponding to regions. Fuzzy features naturally characterize the gradual transition between regions (blurry boundaries) within an image and incorporate the segmentation-related uncertainties into the retrieval algorithm. The resemblance of two images is then defined as the overall similarity between two families of fuzzy features and quantified by a similarity measure, UFM measure, which integrates properties of all the regions in the images. Compared with similarity measures based on individual regions and on all regions with crisp-valued feature representations, the UFM measure greatly reduces the influence of inaccurate segmentation and provides a very intuitive quantification. The UFM has been implemented as a part of our experimental SIMPLIcity image retrieval system. The performance of the system is illustrated using examples from an image database of about 60,000 general-purpose images.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2002.1033216","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1033216","","Image retrieval;Content based retrieval","feature extraction;image retrieval;content-based retrieval;fuzzy logic;image segmentation;fuzzy set theory","region-based fuzzy feature matching;content-based image retrieval;UFM;unified feature matching;image segmentation;fuzzy set;fuzzy feature;region transition;blurry boundaries;crisp-valued feature representations;SIMPLIcity image retrieval system","","236","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The approach is based on marginalizing the static parameters out of the posterior distribution such that only the state vector needs to be considered. Such a marginalization can always be applied. However, real-time applications are only possible when the distribution of the unknown parameters given both observations and the hidden state vector depends on some low-dimensional sufficient statistics. Such sufficient statistics are present in many of the commonly used state-space models.

We formulate MC detection as a supervised-learning problem and apply SVM to develop the detection algorithm. We use the SVM to detect at each location in the image whether an MC is present or not. We tested the proposed method using a database of 76 clinical mammograms containing 1120 MCs. We use free-response receiver operating characteristic curves to evaluate detection performance, and compare the proposed algorithm with several existing methods. In our experiments, the proposed SVM framework outperformed all the other methods tested. In particular, a sensitivity as high as 94% was achieved by the SVM method at an error rate of one false-positive cluster per image.

"Localizing and segmenting text in images and videos","R. Lienhart; A. Wernicke","Intel Corp., Santa Clara, CA, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","","2002","12","4","256","268","Many images, especially those used for page design on Web pages, as well as videos contain visible text. If these text occurrences could be detected, segmented, and recognized automatically, they would be a valuable source of high-level semantics for indexing and retrieval. We propose a novel method for localizing and segmenting text in complex images and videos. Text lines are identified by using a complex-valued multilayer feed-forward network trained to detect text at a fixed scale and position. The network's output at all scales and positions is integrated into a single text-saliency map, serving as a starting point for candidate text lines. In the case of video, these candidate text lines are refined by exploiting the temporal redundancy of text in video. Localized text lines are then scaled to a fixed height of 100 pixels and segmented into a binary image with black characters on white background. For videos, temporal redundancy is exploited to improve segmentation performance. Input images and videos can be of any size due to a true multiresolution approach. Moreover, the system is not only able to locate and segment text occurrences into large binary images, but is also able to track each text line with sub-pixel accuracy over the entire occurrence in a video, so that one text bitmap is created for all instances of that text line. Therefore, our text segmentation results can also be used for object-based video encoding such as that enabled by MPEG-4.","1558-2205","","10.1109/76.999203","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=999203","","Image segmentation;Videos;Web pages;Text recognition;Indexing;Nonhomogeneous media;Feedforward systems;Pixel;Image resolution;Encoding","image segmentation;video signal processing;optical character recognition;object detection;image classification;image retrieval;feedforward neural nets","text localization;text segmentation;text detection;text recognition;image segmentation;video segmentation;high-level semantics;image retrieval;multilayer feed-forward network;binary image;multiresolution approach;MPEG-4 object encoding;text extraction;video indexing;object detection;optical character recognition;OCR","","265","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, based on a systematic approach, a new approach to accurately compensate the dead-time effect is presented.

Electrostatic attractive force increases as the applied voltage increases, and with a thinner dielectric layer. With the narrower width and spacing of interdigitated electrodes, the stronger electrostatic force is obtained. When 1-mm width and spacing interdigitated electrodes and 50-/spl mu/m-thick polymer film are used, the strongest force obtained was about 17 N in the vertical direction at 3.5 kV, for a 4-in silicon wafer.

Thus, in the first stage of our study, we present a new analog phase-shifter topology using only two quarter-wave-length transmission lines.

Its potential is experimentally demonstrated for transient elastography. But, beyond this application, it also could be promising for color flow and reflectivity imaging. To date, only axial displacements induced in human tissues by low-frequency vibrators were measured during transient elastography. The proposed technique allows us to follow both axial and lateral displacements during the shear wave propagation and thus should improve Young's modulus image reconstruction. The process is a combination of several ideas well-known in ultrasonic imaging: ultra-fast imaging, multisynthetic aperture beamforming, 1-D speckle tracking, and compound imaging. Classical beamforming in the transmit mode is replaced here by a single plane wave insonification increasing the frame rate by at least a factor of 128. The beamforming is achieved only in the receive mode on two independent subapertures. Comparison of successive frames by a classical 1-D speckle tracking algorithm allows estimation of displacements along two different directions linked to the subapertures beams. The variance of the estimates is finally improved by tilting the emitting plane wave at each insonification, thus allowing reception of successive decorrelated speckle patterns.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2002.1041078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1041078","","Motion estimation;Ultrasonic imaging;Array signal processing;Speckle;Two dimensional displays;Reflectivity;Humans;Displacement measurement;Vibration measurement;Ultrasonic variables measurement","ultrasonic imaging;biomedical ultrasonics;motion estimation;array signal processing;medical image processing;speckle;Young's modulus;tracking","ultrafast compound imaging;2D motion vector estimation;two-dimensional imaging;transient elastography;2D imaging;high frame rate;ultrasound;colour flow imaging;reflectivity imaging;human tissues;axial displacements;lateral displacements;shear wave propagation;Young's modulus image reconstruction;ultrasonic imaging;multisynthetic aperture beamforming;1D speckle tracking algorithm;decorrelated speckle patterns;single plane wave insonification","Algorithms;Elasticity;Equipment Design;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Enhancement;Models, Statistical;Motion;Phantoms, Imaging;Quality Control;Sensitivity and Specificity;Stress, Mechanical;Ultrasonography;Ultrasonography;Video Recording;Video Recording","260","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A one-lead ECG, unlike two-dimensional biometrics, such as the fingerprint, is a one-dimensional, low-frequency signal that can be recorded from electrodes on the hands. This research applied two techniques, template matching and a decision-based neural network (DBNN), to implement the identity verification. Using each of the two methods separately on a predetermined group of 20 subjects, the experimental results showed that the rate of correct identity verification was 95% for template matching and 80% for the DBNN.

The infrared signal is modeled as the combination of a diffuse component and a line-of-sight (LOS) or direct component. For the diffuse component alone, the properties of the channel are found using Ulbricht's integrating sphere. When a LOS component is also present, the transfer function depends upon the Rician factor K given by the ratio of the electrical power in the LOS and diffuse signals after the detector. For small K, the transfer function shows notches down to low frequencies, but due to the nature of light never for zero frequency. We confirm that a K-factor /spl ges/13 dB is required also in infrared wireless links in order to support distortionless data transmission beyond 100 Mbit/s. Increasing the directivity at the receiver and/or at the transmitter improves the effective value of K. Here, we show that a moderate directivity will be sufficient for high-speed infrared communication in typical indoor scenarios.","1558-0008","","10.1109/49.995522","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=995522","","Wireless communication;Optical fiber communication;Transfer functions;Frequency;Analytical models;Indoor environments;Rician channels;Signal detection;Detectors;Data communication","optical links;optical transfer function;multipath channels","wireless infrared communication channel;indoor environments;diffuse component;line-of-sight component;direct component;Ulbricht's integrating sphere;LOS component;transfer function;Rician factor;electrical power;K-factor;infrared links;data transmission;directivity;high-speed infrared communication","","130","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is due to the fact that the delay cells in a PLL ring-oscillator can consume more power per cell than their counterparts in the DLL. We can show that this effect is stronger than the notorious jitter accumulation effect that occurs in the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) of a PLL. First, an analysis of the stochastic-output jitter of the architectures, due to the most important noise sources, is presented. Then, another important source of jitter in a DLL-based clock multiplier is treated, namely the stochastic mismatch in the delay cells which compose the DLL voltage-controlled delay line (VCDL). An analysis is presented that relates the stochastic spread of the delay of the cells to the output jitter of the clock multiplier. A circuit design technique, called impedance level scaling, is then presented which allows the designer to optimize the noise and mismatch behavior of a circuit, independently from other specifications such as speed and linearity. Applying this technique on a delay cell design yields a direct tradeoff between noise induced jitter and power usage, and between stochastic mismatch induced jitter and power usage.","1558-125X","","10.1109/TCSII.2002.806248","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1097932","","Clocks;Jitter;Phase locked loops;Stochastic resonance;Voltage-controlled oscillators;Circuit noise;Power generation;Voltage;Delay lines;Circuit synthesis","phase locked loops;timing jitter;clocks;frequency multipliers;delay lock loops;voltage-controlled oscillators","phase locked loop;clock multiplier;delay locked loop;voltage controlled oscillator;ring oscillator;delay cell design;stochastic output jitter;stochastic mismatch jitter;voltage-controlled delay;impedance level scaling;circuit design;noise;power usage","","48","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The circuit has been developed for low-cost smart antenna receivers, operating in accordance to the IEEE 802.11a and the high-performance radio local area network (HIPERLAN) wireless network standards at C-band. Capacitance control, required for phase control, is performed by usual MESFETs with capacitance control ratios (C/sub max//C/sub min/) of less than four. The impact of the reflective terminations on the maximum phase-control range and the corresponding loss is discussed. This investigation comprises single capacitive terminations, single resonated terminations, and terminations with two resonated loads-in parallel (DRL). With the DRL terminations, phase-control ranges of over 360/spl deg/ have been reached even with such limited capacitance control ranges. A transformation network is proposed for the DRL termination to reduce loss and loss variations. In this configuration, maximum signal losses of 9 and 3 dB, and 1-dB input compression points of higher than 2 and 8 dBm were measured for the phase shifter at 5.2 GHz within phase-control ranges of 360/spl deg/ and 90/spl deg/, respectively. The branch-line coupler of the phase shifter has been realized by using lumped elements, thereby minimizing the circuit size. The total chip area is only 0.9 mm/sup 2/, which to our knowledge is the smallest size for a passive reflective-type phase shifter with 360/spl deg/ phase-control range reported to date.","1558-173X","","10.1109/4.991386","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=991386","","Phase shifters;MMICs;Capacitance;MESFET integrated circuits;Microwave integrated circuits;Monolithic integrated circuits;Gallium arsenide;Receiving antennas;Receivers;Local area networks","MMIC phase shifters;field effect MMIC;MESFET integrated circuits;adaptive antenna arrays;receiving antennas;IEEE standards;telecommunication standards;phase control;strip line couplers;lumped parameter networks","C-band ultracompact reflective-type MMIC phase shifter;GaAs MESFET process;low-cost smart antenna receivers;IEEE 802.11a standards;HIPERLAN wireless network standards;capacitance control;phase control;reflective terminations;smart antenna combining;maximum phase-control range;loss;single capacitive terminations;single resonated terminations;two resonated loads in parallel;DRL terminations;transformation network;maximum signal losses;1-dB input compression points;branch-line coupler;lumped elements;total chip area;varactor;adaptive antenna combining;0.6 micron;9 dB;3 dB;5.2 GHz;GaAs","","84","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Classical approaches are based on the regulation to zero of an error function computed from the current measurement and a constant desired one. By using such an approach, it is not obvious how to introduce any constraint in the realized trajectories or to ensure the convergence for all the initial configurations. In this paper, we propose a new approach to resolve these difficulties by coupling path planning in image space and image-based control. Constraints such that the object remains in the camera field of view or the robot avoids its joint limits can be taken into account at the task planning level. Furthermore, by using this approach, current measurements always remain close to their desired value, and a control by image-based servoing ensures robustness with respect to modeling errors. The proposed method is based on the potential field approach and is applied whether the object shape and dimensions are known or not, and when the calibration parameters of the camera are well or badly estimated. Finally, real-time experimental results using an eye-in-hand robotic system are presented and confirm the validity of our approach.","2374-958X","","10.1109/TRA.2002.802218","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1044366","","Path planning;Robust control;Robot vision systems;Current measurement;Cameras;Feedback control;Image resolution;Orbital robotics;Error correction;Shape","mobile robots;path planning;robot vision;robust control;servomechanisms;calibration","robust image-based control;path planning;vision feedback control loop techniques;robot positions;image space;camera field of view;robot joint limit avoidance;task planning level;image-based servoing;modeling errors;robustness;potential field approach;camera calibration parameters;real-time experimental results;eye-in-hand robotic system","","256","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is not a subspace weighted MUSIC, because the scaling depends on the eigenstructure of the estimated signal subspace. SSMUSIC has the advantage of simultaneously estimating the DOA and the power of each source. We employ a second-order perturbation analysis of the estimator and derive stochastic representations for its bias and squared-error. We compare the new DOA estimator with the MUSIC estimator, based on these representations. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of SSMUSIC relative to MUSIC and the validity of the perturbation results.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2002.805244","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1137533","","Direction of arrival estimation;Multiple signal classification;Sensor arrays;Signal resolution;Length measurement;Energy resolution;Signal to noise ratio;Vectors;Standards development;Stochastic processes","direction-of-arrival estimation;signal resolution;array signal processing;correlation methods;matrix algebra;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","subspace identification algorithm;high-resolution estimation;DOA estimation;direction of arrival estimator;sensor-array processing;linear algebraic connection;array correlation matrix;signal-plus-interference model;MUSIC algorithm;SSMUSIC;eigenstructure;power estimation;second-order perturbation analysis;stochastic representations;bias;squared error;performance","","101","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Neural-network approximation of piecewise continuous functions: application to friction compensation","R. R. Selmic; F. L. Lewis","Signalogic Inc., Dallas, TX, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","","2002","13","3","745","751","One of the most important properties of neural nets (NNs) for control purposes is the universal approximation property. Unfortunately,, this property is generally proven for continuous functions. In most real industrial control systems there are nonsmooth functions (e.g., piecewise continuous) for which approximation results in the literature are sparse. Examples include friction, deadzone, backlash, and so on. It is found that attempts to approximate piecewise continuous functions using smooth activation functions require many NN nodes and many training iterations, and still do not yield very good results. Therefore, a novel neural-network structure is given for approximation of piecewise continuous functions of the sort that appear in friction, deadzone, backlash, and other motion control actuator nonlinearities. The novel NN consists of neurons having standard sigmoid activation functions, plus some additional neurons having a special class of nonsmooth activation functions termed ""jump approximation basis function."" Two types of nonsmooth jump approximation basis functions are determined- a polynomial-like basis and a sigmoid-like basis. This modified NN with additional neurons having ""jump approximation"" activation functions can approximate any piecewise continuous function with discontinuities at a finite number of known points. Applications of the new NN structure are made to rigid-link robotic systems with friction nonlinearities. Friction is a nonlinear effect that can limit the performance of industrial control systems; it occurs in all mechanical systems and therefore is unavoidable in control systems. It can cause tracking errors, limit cycles, and other undesirable effects. Often, inexact friction compensation is used with standard adaptive techniques that require models that are linear in the unknown parameters. It is shown here how a certain class of augmented NN, capable of approximating piecewise continuous functions, can be used for friction compensation.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2002.1000141","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1000141","","Neural networks;Friction;Neurons;Industrial control;Industrial training;Motion control;Actuators;Polynomials;Service robots;Mechanical systems","transfer functions;neural nets;approximation theory;piecewise polynomial techniques;motion control","neural-network approximation;piecewise continuous functions;friction compensation;industrial control systems;smooth activation functions;neural-network structure;deadzone;backlash;motion control actuator nonlinearities;sigmoid activation functions;jump approximation basis function;rigid-link robotic systems;tracking errors;limit cycles","","97","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The ECG is acquired by placing electrodes on the patient's skin. Motion artifact is the noise that results from motion of the electrode in relation to the patient's skin. Motion artifact can produce large amplitude signals in the ECG that may be misinterpreted by clinicians and automated systems resulting in misdiagnosis, prolonged procedure duration, and delayed or inappropriate treatment decisions. Motion artifact reduction is an unsolved problem because its frequency spectrum overlaps that of the ECG. This paper presents initial results of a novel approach to reducing ECG motion artifact. The hypothesis is that motion artifact can be reduced using electrode motion as the reference signal to an adaptive filter. Electrode motion was measured with two custom-developed sensors that utilized anisotropic magnetoresistive sensors and accelerometers. Motion artifact was induced by manually pushing on the electrode, pushing on the skin around the electrode, and pulling on the lead wire. Using an adaptive filter and the motion signal, the induced motion artifact was reduced in all data sets.","1094-687X","0-7803-7612-9","10.1109/IEMBS.2002.1106451","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1106451","","Electrodes;Electrocardiography;Skin;Adaptive filters;Magnetic sensors;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Electric potential;Heart;Delay;Frequency","electrocardiography;adaptive filters;adaptive signal processing;medical signal processing;signal denoising;skin;biomedical electrodes;accelerometers;motion measurement;magnetoresistive devices","electrocardiogram;motion artifact adaptive reduction;ECG;body-surface manifestation;electrical potentials;heart;electrode motion;large amplitude signals;automated systems;misdiagnosis;prolonged procedure duration;delayed treatment decisions;inappropriate treatment decisions;unsolved problem;frequency spectrum;reference signal;adaptive filter;custom-developed sensors;skin;noise;anisotropic magnetoresistive sensors;lead wire;three-axis accelerometer sensor;dual axis accelerometers","","57","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For input pulses of 150-fs duration injected in the anomalous dispersion regime, the effect of modulational instability is shown to lead to severe temporal jitter in the output, and associated fluctuations in the spectral amplitude and phase across the generated supercontinuum. The spectral phase fluctuations are quantified by performing multiple simulations and calculating both the standard deviation of the phase and, more rigorously, the degree of first-order coherence as a function of wavelength across the spectrum. By performing simulations over a range of input pulse durations and wavelengths, we can identify the conditions under which coherent supercontinua with a well-defined spectral phase are generated.","1558-4542","","10.1109/JSTQE.2002.1016369","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1016369","","Numerical simulation;Supercontinuum generation;Optical noise;Optical fiber dispersion;Phase noise;Pulse modulation;Fluctuations;Pulse generation;Optical fibers;Photonic crystals","optical solitons;multiwave mixing;light coherence;optical fibre dispersion;quantum noise;timing jitter;stimulated Raman scattering;self-phase modulation;photonic band gap","photonic crystal fibers;tapered optical fibers;broadband supercontinuum generation;numerical simulations;coherence properties;nonlinearity characteristics;optical shock terms;Raman nonlinearity terms;quantum noise;anomalous dispersion regime;modulational instability;temporal jitter;spectral amplitude fluctuations;spectral phase fluctuations;degree of first-order coherence;nonlinear pulse propagation;Raman solitons;generalized scalar propagation equation;group velocity dispersion;self-phase modulation","","96","","41","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The transistor source resistance and threshold voltage is determined experimentally at different elevated temperatures to construct channel temperature versus dissipated power transfer characteristic. It is found that the HEMT channel temperature increases rapidly with dissipated power and at 6 W/mm reaches values of /spl sim/320/spl deg/C for sapphire and /spl sim/95/spl deg/C for silicon substrate, respectively.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2002.801430","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019941","","Aluminum compounds;Gallium compounds;Power MODFETs;Sapphire;Silicon;Resistance","aluminium compounds;gallium compounds;III-V semiconductors;wide band gap semiconductors;power HEMT;sapphire;silicon;substrates;semiconductor device measurement;negative resistance;thermal analysis","channel temperature determination;AlGaN/GaN HEMTs;sapphire substrate;Si substrate;transistor DC characterization methods;self-heating effects;temperature rise;negative differential output resistance;high dissipated power levels;source-drain current drop;parasitic source resistance;threshold voltage changes;transistor source resistance;elevated temperatures;dissipated power transfer;power FETs;semiconductor device measurements;semiconductor device thermal factors;III-nitrides;320 degC;95 degC;AlGaN-GaN;Si;Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/","","119","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown that higher order filter characteristics can be obtained from lower order sections, which are connected in parallel between the source and load, by proper superposition of the individual lower order responses. This property can be used in modular filter design by focusing on separate sections of the filter one at a time. In addition, some of these coupling schemes exhibit zero-shifting properties, whereby transmission zeros can be shifted from one side of the passband to the other by simply changing the resonant frequencies of the resonators while keeping all the coupling coefficients unchanged. Several novel filter designs of different kinds (microstrip, planar waveguide cavity, and dual-mode types) are introduced to prove the new method and to give an idea of the extended design possibilities.

The AMR-WB codec was also selected by the International Telecommunication Union-Telecommunication Sector (ITU-T) in July 2001 in the standardization activity for wideband speech coding around 16 kb/s and was approved in January 2002 as Recommendation G.722.2. The adoption of AMR-WB by ITU-T is of significant importance since for the first time the same codec is adopted for wireless as well as wireline services. AMR-WB uses an extended audio bandwidth from 50 Hz to 7 kHz and gives superior speech quality and voice naturalness compared to existing second- and third-generation mobile communication systems. The wideband speech service provided by the AMR-WB codec will give mobile communication speech quality that also substantially exceeds (narrowband) wireline quality.

In the haptic guidance paradigm, the subject is physically guided through the ideal motion by the haptic interface, thus giving the subject a kinesthetic understanding of what is required. Subjects learned a complex 3D motion under three training conditions (haptic, visual, haptic and visual) and were required to manually reproduce the movement under two recall conditions (with vision, without vision). Performance was measured in terms of position, shape, timing, and drift. Findings from this study indicate that haptic guidance is effective in training. While visual training was better for teaching the trajectory shape, temporal aspects of the task were more effectively learned from haptic guidance. This supports a possible role for haptics in the training of perceptual motor skills in virtual environments.","","0-7695-1489-8","10.1109/HAPTIC.2002.998939","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=998939","","Haptic interfaces;Virtual environment;Shape measurement;Humans;Feedback;Mechanical engineering;Surgery;Position measurement;Timing;Education","haptic interfaces;computer aided instruction;computer based training;virtual reality","haptics;skills training;haptic guidance;training conditions;training;perceptual motor skills;virtual environments;motor learning","","162","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Procedures of how to tune the equipment for optimal results with respect to etch rate and profile control are described. Profile control is a delicate balance between the respective etching and deposition rates of a SiO/sub x/F/sub y/ passivation layer on the sidewalls and bottom of an etched structure in relation to the silicon removal rate from unpassivated areas. Any parameter that affects the relative rates of these processes has an effect on profile control. The deposition of the SiO/sub x/F/sub y/ layer is mainly determined by the oxygen content in the SF/sub 6/ gas flow and the electrode temperature. Removal of the SiO/sub x/F/sub y/ layer is mainly determined by the kinetic energy (self-bias) of ions in the SF/sub 6//O/sub 2/ plasma. Diagrams for profile control are given as a function of parameter settings, employing the previously published ""black silicon method"". Parameter settings for high rate silicon bulk etching, and the etching of micro needles and micro moulds are discussed, which demonstrate the usefulness of the diagrams for optimal design of etched features. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that in order to use the oxygen flow as a control parameter for cryogenic DRIE, it is necessary to avoid or at least restrict the presence of fused silica as a dome material, because this material may release oxygen due to corrosion during operation of the plasma source. When inert dome materials like alumina are used, etching recipes can be defined for a broad variety of microstructures in the cryogenic temperature regime. Recipes with relatively low oxygen content (1-10% of the total gas volume) and ions with low kinetic energy can now be applied to observe a low lateral etch rate beneath the mask, and a high selectivity (more than 500) of silicon etching with respect to polymers and oxide mask materials is obtained. Crystallographic preference etching of silicon is observed at low wafer temperature (-120/spl deg/C). This effect is enhanced by increasing the process pressure above 10 mtorr or for low ion energies (below 20 eV).","1941-0158","","10.1109/JMEMS.2002.800928","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1022850","","Plasma temperature;Guidelines;Etching;Silicon;Micromechanical devices;Plasma applications;Cryogenics;Kinetic energy;Optimal control;Passivation","silicon;elemental semiconductors;sputter etching;cryogenics;micromechanical devices;oxygen;sulphur compounds;fluorine","deep reactive ion etching;deep RIE;Si MEMS structures;SF/sub 6//O/sub 2/-based high-density plasmas;cryogenic temperatures;etch rate;profile control;deposition rates;SiO/sub x/F/sub y/ passivation layer;oxygen content;SF/sub 6/ gas flow;electrode temperature;high rate Si bulk etching;micro needles;micro moulds;inert dome materials;alumina;etching recipes;crystallographic preference etching;-120 degC;Si;SF/sub 6/-O/sub 2/;SF/sub 6/;O/sub 2/;SiOF;SiOF-Si","","192","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

From a 5.5-GHz carrier, the in-band phase noise can be as low as -88 dBc/Hz at a 40-kHz offset, while the phase noise for the free-running VCO is -116 dBc/Hz at an 1-MHz offset. The VCO core current is 4.6 mA. The prescaler is implemented using a variation of the source-coupled logic (SCL) structure to reduce the switching noise, and thus to reduce the PLL side-band spurs. At -18 dBm signal power measured off chip, the switching noise coupled through substrate and metal interconnect generates spurs with power levels less than -99 dBm when the loop is open. A new charge-pump circuit is developed to reduce the current glitch at the output node.

Different strategies used for increasing device stability are addressed and the models proposed to explain experimental observations related to OLED operational stability are discussed. Although none of the presently proposed models can explain all experimental observations, the largest body of experimental evidence appears to be consistent with a model based on the instability of cationic AlQ/sub 3/ species, produced by the injection of holes into the AlQ/sub 3/ electron transport and emitter layer. Other models may be of importance in explaining degradation behavior on different time scales. Models based on redistribution of space charge appear to be responsible for reversible short-term degradation, while a model based on indium migration may be important for degradation on very long time scales.","1558-4542","","10.1109/2944.999191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=999191","","Thermal degradation;Organic light emitting diodes;Stability;Electroluminescence;Electron emission;Organic materials;Polymer films;Conducting materials;Aluminum;Charge carrier processes","organic compounds;light emitting diodes;reliability;stability","small molecule-based organic light-emitting devices;OLED;degradation mechanisms;electron transport material;green spectrum;red spectrum;models;OLED operational stability;instability;electron transport;electron emitter layer;degradation behavior;time scales;short-term degradation;indium migration;long time scales;reliability;tris (8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum;AlQ/sub 3/","","101","","62","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, the dynamic model of an indirect field-oriented LIM drive is derived. Then, a backstepping sliding mode approach is proposed to compensate the uncertainties which occur in the motion control system. The uncertainties are lumped, and the bound of the lumped uncertainty is necessary in the design of the backstepping sliding mode controller. However, the bound of the lumped uncertainty is difficult to obtain in advance in practical applications. Therefore, an adaptive law is derived to adapt the value of the lumped uncertainty in real-time, and an adaptive backstepping sliding mode control law is proposed. With the adaptive backstepping sliding mode controller, the mover position of the LIM drive possesses the advantages of good transient control performance and robustness to uncertainties for the tracking of periodic reference trajectories. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified by both the simulated and experimental results.","1350-2352","","10.1049/ip-epa:20020138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1006956","","","linear induction motors;induction motor drives;adaptive control;variable structure systems;machine vector control;uncertain systems;robust control;tracking;position control;motion control","adaptive backstepping sliding mode control;linear induction motor drive;adaptive backstepping control;sliding mode control;mover position control;uncertainties compensation;friction force;dynamic model;indirect field-oriented LIM drive;motion control system;lumped uncertainty;adaptive law;real-time;transient control performance;uncertainty robustness;periodic reference trajectories tracking;robust control system","","73","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals"

This method has been treated by various writers, and solutions are available for telegraph lines with simple terminal conditions. It is well known that the extension of the same methods to more complicated terminal conditions, which represent the usual terminal apparatus, leads to great difficulties. The present paper attacks the same problem from the alternative standpoint of the steady-state characteristics of the system. This method has the advantage over the method of transients that the complication of the circuit which results from the use of terminal apparatus does not complicate the calculations materially. This method of treatment necessitates expressing the criteria of distortionless transmission in terms of the steady-state characteristics. Accordingly, a considerable portion of the paper describes and illustrates a method for making this translation. A discussion is given of the minimum frequency range required for transmission at a given speed of signaling. In the case of carrier telegraphy, this discussion includes a comparison of single-sideband and double-sideband transmission. A number of incidental topics is also discussed.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.989875","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=989875","","Telegraphy;Steady-state;Frequency conversion;Signal processing;Telephony;Phase distortion;Circuit analysis computing;Shape","telegraphy;information theory;signalling","telegraph transmission theory;Nyquist classic paper;telegraph signal distortion;steady-state characteristics;distortionless transmission;minimum frequency range;signaling speed;carrier telegraphy;single-sideband transmission;double-sideband transmission","","165","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Key factors are derived from empirical evidence of reuse practices, as emerged from a survey of projects for the introduction of reuse in European companies: 24 such projects performed from 1994 to 1997 were analyzed using structured interviews. The projects were undertaken in both large and small companies, working in a variety of business domains, and using both object-oriented and procedural development approaches. Most of them produce software with high commonality between applications, and have at least reasonably mature processes. Despite that apparent potential for success, around one-third of the projects failed. Three main causes of failure were not introducing reuse-specific processes, not modifying nonreuse processes, and not considering human factors. The root cause was a lack of commitment by top management, or nonawareness of the importance of those factors, often coupled with the belief that using the object-oriented approach or setting up a repository seamlessly is all that is necessary to achieve success in reuse. Conversely, successes were achieved when, given a potential for reuse because of commonality among applications, management committed to introducing reuse processes, modifying nonreuse processes, and addressing human factors.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2002.995420","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=995420","","Companies;Human factors;Performance analysis;Application software","software reusability;object-oriented programming;software development management;human factors","company-wide software reuse program;survey;European companies;small companies;large companies;business;object-oriented programming;project failure;procedural development;human factors;top management","","125","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Defense Acad., Yokosuka, Japan; NA","IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","","2002","44","5","30","43","With the progress and rapid increase in mobile terminals, the design of antennas for small mobile terminals is acquiring great importance. In view of this situation, the design concept of antenna systems for small mobile terminals and its future perspective are discussed, referring to the trends in modern mobile communications and the demands for the antenna system. The design concept of antenna systems has changed along with the progress of mobile systems. In the conventional design, the conducting material of the equipment case, existing near the antenna element, is included as a part of the radiator in the antenna system, without regard to whether or not it has been considered. In the latest mobile phones, the design concept has been advanced to aim at improving the antenna's performance, and the treatment of the case, etc., has become a part of this. Some particular considerations for the design are to relieve the degradation of the antenna's performance due to the human-body effect, to overcome the SAR problems, and yet to make the size small. Furthermore, it is now time to proceed to the more-advanced concept, in which implementation of adaptive control and software is considered, even in small mobile terminals. Typical trends in modern communications systems are discussed, and the demands of these trends-which are summarized as down-sizing, function, and intelligence-are taken up for future antenna structures. Small-antenna technology and the application of the integration technology to antenna systems are essential for realizing such future structures.","1558-4143","","10.1109/MAP.2002.1077775","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1077775","","Mobile antennas;Telephone sets;Degradation;Cellular phones;Bandwidth;Mobile communication;Conducting materials;Mobile handsets;Adaptive control;Intelligent structures","mobile antennas;cellular radio;monopole antennas;VHF antennas;antenna radiation patterns;loop antennas","design concept;small mobile terminals;mobile communications;human-body effect;SAR;adaptive control;antenna structures;portable radio communication;antenna proximity factors;land mobile radio cellular systems","","71","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

As a result, the output voltages also have low-frequency distortion, which includes even and odd multiples of the fundamental. In this paper, a new space-vector pulsewidth-modulation strategy is presented to avoid that low-frequency output voltage distortion. This modulation method tries to balance the voltages of the capacitors by using only three vectors per modulation cycle. The duty ratios are directly calculated from the space-vector diagram, even when balance is not achieved. For all cases, the result is a balanced set of three AC output voltages.

Finally, a post-processing step is applied on the obtained object mask to remove noise regions and to smooth the object boundary. In situations where object shadows appear in the background region, a pre-processing gradient filter is applied on the input image to reduce the shadow effect.

This paper describes an experiment that compares the performance of able-bodied subjects using voice control to operate a power wheelchair both with and without navigation assistance.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2002.1031981","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1031981","","Wheelchairs;Control systems;Navigation;Switches;Automatic control;Biomedical engineering;Speech recognition;Safety;Velocity control;Bandwidth","handicapped aids;biocontrol;navigation;computerised navigation;voice equipment","powered wheelchair;voice control;obstacles avoidance;frequent small velocity adjustments;able-bodied subjects performance;navigation assistance;limited bandwidth","Acoustics;Adult;Equipment Design;Feedback;Female;Humans;Male;Speech;Task Performance and Analysis;User-Computer Interface;Voice;Wheelchairs","82","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, they have some drawbacks for large tuning ranges, such as high tuning sensitivity causing high sensitivity to noise and disturbances on the control voltage. Furthermore, large metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) varactors have high conversion of harmless amplitude noise into harmful phase noise. To reduce these problems a small varactor can be used in combination with MOS-transistors that switch fixed capacitors in and out of the oscillator. The limitations due to the imperfect complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) switches are investigated, and an improved structure for use with the popular differential CMOS LC-oscillator is presented.","1558-125X","","10.1109/TCSII.2002.801415","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1025154","","Voltage-controlled oscillators;Tuning;Frequency;Phase noise;Circuit optimization;Varactors;Switches;Voltage control;Parasitic capacitance;Capacitors","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;voltage-controlled oscillators;circuit tuning;integrated circuit layout;switched capacitor networks;varactors;UHF oscillators;UHF integrated circuits","differential CMOS VCOs;improved switched tuning;small varactor;MOS-transistors;fixed capacitor switching;imperfect CMOS switches;differential CMOS LC-oscillator;frequency tuning;RF CMOS;layout aspects","","78","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"A new maximum power point tracking control scheme for wind generation","Jia Yaoqin; Yang Zhongqing; Cao Binggang","Dept. of Mechatronics Eng., Xi'an Jiaotong Univ., China; NA; NA","Proceedings. International Conference on Power System Technology","","2002","1","","144","148 vol.1","According to the aerodynamical characteristic of the wind turbine, a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is necessary to get high efficiency for wind power conversion, which means that the rotating speed of wind turbine should be adjusted in the real time to capture maximum wind power. Because of the fast variation of wind speed and the heavy inertia of generator, the MPPT control of wind generation is much challengeable. A new MPPT control scheme has been developed for permanent magnetic (PM) generator driven by a three-phase inverter to generate 350 V direct current power to the DC bus line. The main differences between the method used in the proposed MPPT system and other techniques used in the past are as follows: (1) the tracking step is variable according to the change of wind speed; (2) in order to avoid the dead time effect of the inverter the MPPT control is synchronized to the rotating speed of the generator; (3) a low pass filter is used at the output of the MPPT controller to decrease the fluctuation of the rotating speed reference. The resulting system has high-efficiency, lower-cost and fast, stable tracking speed. The experimental results show that it can track as fast as 0.2Hz variation of wind speed and increases the output wind power as much as 48%. As a result, the efficiency of the generation has been improved evidently.","","0-7803-7459-2","10.1109/ICPST.2002.1053521","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1053521","","Wind power generation;Power generation;Wind energy generation;Wind energy;Wind speed;Wind turbines;DC generators;Inverters;Control systems;Low pass filters","wind turbines;power control;permanent magnet generators;invertors;angular velocity control;synchronisation;power generation control","maximum power point tracking control;wind generation;aerodynamical characteristic;MPPT;high efficiency;maximum wind power;wind speed variation;heavy inertia;permanent magnetic generator;three-phase inverter;direct current power;DC bus line;variable tracking step;wind speed change;dead time effect avoidance;synchronization;low pass filter;rotating speed reference fluctuation;output wind power;microcontrollers;variable speed generation;power electronics;350 V","","38","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Instead of monitoring the ongoing traffic at the front end (like firewall or proxy) or a victim server itself, we detect the SYN flooding attacks at leaf routers that connect end hosts to the Internet. The simplicity of our detection mechanism lies in its statelessness and low computation overhead, which make the detection mechanism itself immune to flooding attacks. Our detection mechanism is based on the protocol behavior of TCP SYN-FIN (RST) pairs, and is an instance of the Seqnential Change Point Detection [l]. To make the detection mecbanism insensitive to site and access pattern, a non-parametric Cnmnlative Sum (CUSUM) method [4] is applied, thus making the detection mechanism much more generally applicable and its deployment much easier. The efficacy of this detection mechanism is validated by trace-driven simulations. The evaluation results show that the detection mechanism has short detection latency and high detection accuracy. Moreover, due to its proximity to the flooding sources, our mechanism not only sets alarms upon detection of ongoing SYN flooding attacks, but also reveals the location of the flooding sources without resorting to expensive IP traceback.","0743-166X","0-7803-7476-2","10.1109/INFCOM.2002.1019404","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019404","","Floods;Web server;Network servers;Web and internet services;Computer crime;Robustness;Monitoring;Access protocols;Delay;IP networks","","","","115","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Wiesbeck","Inst. fur Hochstfrequenztechnik und Elektron., Karlsruhe Univ., Germany; NA; NA","IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","","2002","20","6","1178","1192","A novel stochastic channel model for the indoor propagation channel is presented. It is especially for, but not limited to future communication systems with multiple antennas like space division multiple access (SDMA), spatial filtering for interference reduction (SFIR), or multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO). The model is designed for indoor scenarios, straight forward extendable to urban environments. It is based on physical wave propagation. The new approach describes the channel by multipath components, each characterized by its transfer matrix (including loss), delay, direction of arrival, and departure. The appearance and disappearance of multipath components over time is modeled as a birth and death process, a marked Poisson process. This enables first-time the correct modeling of spatial and temporal correlations. In each modeling step, path properties change according to the motion of transmitter and receiver. The changing delay times of propagation paths yield a realistic Doppler behavior of the channel. Deterministic ray tracing results are used to produce the huge data sets required for the statistical evaluation of the parameters of the proposed model. This method enables an automated parameter extraction for new environments or frequencies. The ray tracing tool has been verified by narrowband, wideband, and directional channel measurements. The novel stochastic spatial channel model allows the simulation of third-generation broadband radio systems including arbitrary antenna configurations and patterns. System simulations for the bit-error rate of radio links can be performed including intelligent antenna configurations like SDMA, SFIR, or MIMO. Furthermore, the capacity of complete systems can be investigated.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2002.801218","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1021910","","Stochastic processes;Multipath channels;Indoor environments;Multiaccess communication;MIMO;Ray tracing;Broadband antennas;Antennas and propagation;Filtering;Interference","indoor radio;radiowave propagation;space division multiple access;filtering theory;interference suppression;radiofrequency interference;fading channels;multipath channels;multiuser channels;broadband networks;radio networks;land mobile radio;MIMO systems;adaptive antenna arrays;digital simulation;ray tracing;stochastic processes","stochastic multipath channel model;path directions;indoor environments;indoor propagation channel;multiple antennas;space division multiple access;SDMA;spatial filtering;interference reduction;multiple-input/multiple-output system;urban environments;physical wave propagation;multipath components;transfer matrix;loss;delay;direction of arrival;birth and death process;Poisson process;spatial correlation;temporal correlation;transmitter;receiver;delay times;Doppler behavior;deterministic ray tracing;statistical evaluation;automated parameter extraction;directional channel measurements;wideband measurements;narrowband measurements;system simulation;bit-error rate;radio links;intelligent antenna configurations;systems capacity;third-generation broadband radio systems;antenna configurations;antenna patterns","","119","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our phase-based approach proceeds in three stages. First, the image sequence is spatially filtered using a bank of quadrature pairs of Gabor filters, and the temporal phase gradient is computed, yielding estimates of the velocity component in directions orthogonal to the filter pairs' orientations. Second, a component velocity is rejected if the corresponding filter pair's phase information is not linear over a given time span. Third, the remaining component velocities at a single spatial location are combined and a recurrent neural network is used to derive the full velocity.

Therefore, speckle reduction is a prerequisite for many SAR image processing tasks. In this paper, we develop a speckle reduction algorithm by fusing the wavelet Bayesian denoising technique with Markov-random-field-based image regularization. Wavelet coefficients are modeled independently and identically by a two-state Gaussian mixture model, while their spatial dependence is characterized by a Markov random field imposed on the hidden state of Gaussian mixtures. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm is used to estimate hyperparameters and specify the mixture model, and the iterated-conditional-modes method is implemented to optimize the state configuration. The noise-free wavelet coefficients are finally estimated by a shrinkage function based on local weighted averaging of the Bayesian estimator. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms standard wavelet denoising techniques in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio and the equivalent-number-of-looks measures in most cases. It also achieves better performance than the refined Lee filter.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2002.802473","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1105905","","Speckle;Noise reduction;Markov random fields;Synthetic aperture radar;Bayesian methods;Wavelet coefficients;Image processing;Expectation-maximization algorithms;State estimation;Optimization methods","geophysical techniques;geophysical signal processing;terrain mapping;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;radar imaging;speckle;Markov processes;Bayes methods;wavelet transforms","geophysical measurement technique;land surface;terrain mapping;radar remote sensing;synthetic aperture radar;Markov random field model;speckle reduction;wavelet transform;wavelet denoising;algorithm;Bayesian method;Bayes method;image regularization;two-state Gaussian mixture model;Expectation-Maximization algorithm;hyperparameters;mixture model;radar imaging;granular appearance;speckle noise;image processing","","245","","51","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Proceedings.","","2002","","","55","59 vol.1","A recommender system in an e-learning context is a software agent that tries to ""intelligently"" recommend actions to a learner based on the actions of previous learners.

These recommendation systems have been tried in e-commerce to entice purchasing of goods, but haven't been tried in e-learning. This paper suggests the use of web mining techniques to build such an agent that could recommend on-line learning activities or shortcuts in a course web site based on learners' access history to improve course material navigation as well as assist the online learning process.

Results demonstrate that within-die fluctuations primarily impact the FMAX mean and die-to-die fluctuations determine the majority of the FMAX variance. Employing rigorously derived device and circuit models, the impact of die-to-die and within-die parameter fluctuations on future FMAX distributions is forecast for the 180, 130, 100, 70, and 50-nm technology generations. Model predictions reveal that systematic within-die fluctuations impose the largest performance degradation resulting from parameter fluctuations. Assuming a 3/spl sigma/ channel length deviation of 20%, projections for the 50-nm technology generation indicate that essentially a generation of performance gain can be lost due to systematic within-die fluctuations. Key insights from this work elucidate the recommendations that manufacturing process controls be targeted specifically toward sources of systematic within-die fluctuations, and the development of new circuit design methodologies be aimed at suppressing the effect of within-die parameter fluctuations.","1558-173X","","10.1109/4.982424","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=982424","","Fluctuations;Semiconductor device modeling;Microprocessors;Shape measurement;Predictive models;Clocks;Frequency;Circuits;Technology forecasting;Degradation","microprocessor chips;CMOS digital integrated circuits;semiconductor process modelling;integrated circuit manufacture;critical path analysis;SPICE;integrated circuit modelling","maximum clock frequency distribution;microprocessor;gigascale integration;within-die fluctuations;die-to-die fluctuations;circuit models;device models;performance degradation;parameter fluctuations;manufacturing process controls;critical path delay variations;manufacturing tolerances;technology projections;generic critical path model;SPICE-equivalent circuit simulator","","497","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

High performance position control at low and zero speed is only possible using anisotropic effects being considered not in the fundamental-frequency machine models, but in extended high-frequency models. This paper presents a new high-frequency injection method estimating the rotor position, which overcomes the small signal to noise ratio inherent to methods of this type published so far. This enables to track even small saliencies typical for SMPM synchronous machines. A small high-frequency voltage signal is injected into the rotor d-axis with no influence on the torque producing q-current. The demodulation of the responding high-frequency current signal is independent on machine parameters. Therefore the proposed method is independent on machine parameters and simply adaptable to different machines. As only the high frequency current has to be processed for position estimation, there is no additional hardware necessary besides that for standard drives with field oriented control.","","0-7803-7474-6","10.1109/IECON.2002.1187588","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1187588","","Position control;Permanent magnet machines;Frequency estimation;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Signal to noise ratio;Synchronous machines;Voltage;Torque;Demodulation;Hardware","machine vector control;permanent magnet motors;rotors;synchronous motors;parameter estimation;position control","sensorless position control;surface mounted permanent magnet synchronous machines;low speed;zero speed;anisotropic effects;high-frequency injection method;rotor position estimation;small signal to noise ratio;high-frequency voltage signal;rotor d-axis;torque producing q-current;demodulation;high-frequency current signal;high frequency current;position estimation;field oriented control","","131","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, resistance by individual software developers against using such methodologies often obstructs their successful deployment. To better explain why individual developers accept or resist methodologies, five theoretical models of individual intentions to accept information technology tools were examined. In a field study of 128 developers in a large organization that implemented a methodology, each model explained significant variance in developers' intentions to use the methodology. Similar to findings from the tool adoption context, we found that, if a methodology is not regarded as useful by developers, its prospects for successful deployment may be severely undermined. In contrast to the typical pattern of findings in a tool context, however, we found that methodology adoption intentions are driven by: 1) the presence of an organizational mandate to use the methodology, 2) the compatibility of the methodology with how developers perform their work, and 3) the opinions of developers' coworkers and supervisors toward using the methodology. Collectively, these results provide surprising new insights into why software developers accept or resist methodologies and suggest what software engineering managers might do to overcome developer resistance.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2002.1158287","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1158287","","Programming;Information technology;Software engineering;Productivity;Resists;Software development management;Computer Society;Engineering management;Technological innovation;Production","software engineering;information technology","software developer acceptance;software development processes;information technology tools;tool adoption context;software developers;software engineering managers","","115","","70","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The ICS can be operated in either discontinuous current mode (DCM) or continuous current mode (CCM), while the flyback or forward DC/DC converter is operated in CCM. Almost all single-stage PFC AC/DC converters suffer from high bulk capacitor voltage stress and extra switch current stress. The bulk capacitor voltage feedback with a coupled winding structure is widely used to reduce both the voltage and current stresses in practical single-stage PFC AC/DC converters. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the bulk capacitor voltage feedback, including the relationship between bulk capacitor voltage, input current harmonics, voltage feedback ratio, and load condition. The maximum bulk capacitor voltage appears when the DC/DC converter operates at the boundary between CCM and DCM. This paper also reveals that only the voltage feedback ratio determines the input current harmonics under DCM ICS and CCM DC/DC operation.

Boundaries between domains are chosen to exploit existing queues, thereby minimizing inter-domain synchronization costs. We propose four clock domains, corresponding to the front end , integer units, floating point units, and load-store units. We evaluate this design using a simulation infrastructure based on SimpleScalar and Wattch. In an attempt to quantify potential energy savings independent of any particular on-line control strategy, we use off-line analysis of traces from a single-speed run of each of our benchmark applications to identify profitable reconfiguration points for a subsequent dynamic scaling run. Using applications from the MediaBench, Olden, and SPEC2000 benchmark suites, we obtain an average energy-delay product improvement of 20% with MCD compared to a modest 3% savings from voltage scaling a single clock and voltage system.","1530-0897","0-7695-1525-8","10.1109/HPCA.2002.995696","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=995696","","Energy efficiency;Process design;Clocks;Dynamic voltage scaling;Wire;Delay;Frequency conversion;Frequency synchronization;Costs;Potential energy","microprocessor chips;synchronisation;delays;low-power electronics;integrated circuit design;logic simulation","energy-efficient processor design;multiple clock domains;dynamic voltage scaling;dynamic frequency scaling;clock frequency;feature size;clock distribution;wire delays;singly-clocked globally synchronous systems;inter-domain synchronization costs;front end;integer units;floating point units;load-store units;SimpleScalar;Wattch;Intel XScale;Transmeta LongRun;MediaBench;Olden;SPEC2000;average energy-delay product improvement","","187","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A zeroth-order regularization functional is used to incorporate a priori information about the smoothness of the parameters into the problem formulation. We adapt the Butler-Reeds-Dawson (1981) algorithm to solve this optimization problem in three steps. In the first step, the data are compressed using singular value decomposition (SVD) of the kernels. The tensor-product structure of the kernel is exploited so that the compressed data is typically a thousand fold smaller than the original data. This size reduction is crucial for fast optimization. In the second step, the constrained optimization problem is transformed to an unconstrained optimization problem in the compressed data space. In the third step, a suboptimal value of the smoothing parameter is chosen by the BRD method. Steps 2 and 3 are iterated until convergence of the algorithm.

A square-shaped search pattern is adopted in many popular fast algorithms. Recently, a diamond-shaped search pattern was introduced in fast block motion estimation and has exhibited a faster search speed. Based on an in-depth examination of the influence of the search pattern on speed performance, we propose a novel algorithm using a hexagon-based search pattern to achieve further improvement. The hexagon-based search pattern is investigated in comparison with diamond search pattern and demonstrates significant speedup gain over the diamond-based search. Analysis shows that a speed improvement rate of the hexagon-based search (HEXBS) algorithm over the diamond search (DS) algorithm can be over 80% for locating some motion vectors in certain scenarios. In short, the proposed HEXBS algorithm can find the same motion vector with fewer search points than the DS algorithm. Generally speaking, the larger the motion vector, the more search points the. HEXBS algorithm can save, which is further justified by experimental results.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2002.1003474","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1003474","","Motion estimation;Signal processing algorithms;Shape;Algorithm design and analysis;ISO standards;Motion analysis;Partitioning algorithms;Computational complexity;Redundancy;Pattern analysis","motion estimation;video coding;image matching","search pattern;block motion estimation;search speed;distortion performance;square shape;diamond shape;hexagon shape;motion vector;video coding;block matching","","583","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The former exploits the undecimated discrete wavelet transform, which is an octave bandpass representation achieved from a conventional discrete wavelet transform by omitting all decimators and upsampling the wavelet filter bank. The latter relies on the generalized Laplacian pyramid, which is another oversampled structure obtained by recursively subtracting from an image an expanded decimated lowpass version. Both the methods selectively perform spatial-frequencies spectrum substitution from an image to another. In both schemes, context dependency is exploited by thresholding the local correlation coefficient between the images to be merged, to avoid injection of spatial details that are not likely to occur in the target image. Unlike other multiscale fusion schemes, both the present decompositions are not critically subsampled, thus avoiding possible impairments in the fused images, due to missing cancellation of aliasing terms. Results are presented and discussed on SPOT data.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2002.803623","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1105917","","Spatial resolution;Image resolution;Multiresolution analysis;Discrete wavelet transforms;Filter bank;Laplace equations;Image sensors;Multispectral imaging;Wavelet analysis;Remote sensing","geophysical techniques;geophysical signal processing;terrain mapping;image processing;sensor fusion;multidimensional signal processing;wavelet transforms;image resolution","geophysical measurement technique;land surface;terrain mapping;remote sensing;visible;IR;infrared;image processing;context driven fusion;sensor fusion;multispectral remote sensing;image resolution;spatial resolution;spectral resolution;oversampled multiresolution analysis;multispectral image;undecimated discrete wavelet transform;octave bandpass representation;generalized Laplacian pyramid;oversampled structure;thresholding;local correlation coefficient;panchromatic observations","","420","","41","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A physical modeling of this plant is made based on the general laws of physics. For this type of control problem, it is extremely important to prevent the occurrence of web break or fold by decoupling the web tension and the web velocity. Due to the wide-range variation of the radius and inertia of the rollers the system dynamics change considerably during the winding/unwinding process. Different strategies for web tension control and linear transport velocity control are presented. First, an H/sub /spl infin// robust control strategy which reduces the coupling between tension and velocity, is compared to the decentralized control strategy with proportional integral derivative (PID) controllers commonly used in the industry. Second, an H/sub /spl infin// robust control strategy with varying gains is shown to render the control more robust to the radius variations. Then, a linear parameter varying (LPV) control strategy with smooth scheduling of controllers is synthesized for different operating points and compared to the previous methods. Finally, this LPV control and the H/sub /spl infin// robust control strategy with varying gains are combined to give the best results on an experimental setup, for the rejection of the disturbances introduced by velocity variations and for the robustness to radius and inertia changes.","1558-0865","","10.1109/87.987065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=987065","","Robust control;Velocity control;Control systems;Physics;Distributed control;Three-term control;PD control;Pi control;Proportional control;Industrial control","robust control;friction;mechanical variables control;velocity control;process control;H/sup /spl infin// control;linear systems;control system synthesis;three-term control;decentralised control;winding (process)","robust control;winding systems;elastic webs;web transport system;winder;unwinder;elastic material;web break;web fold;web tension;web velocity;decentralized control strategy;proportional integral derivative controllers;varying gains;radius variations;linear parameter varying control strategy;linear matrix inequality;disturbance rejection;web tension control;linear transport velocity control;H/sub /spl infin// robust control strategy","","167","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Efficiency, safety, environmental, and legislative concerns have made inspection and assessment of communal sewers a central issue to water and sewerage companies. Nowadays, the standard sewer inspection system is based on a wheeled platform on which a closed circuit television (CCTV) camera is mounted. One of the disadvantages of camera inspection systems is that they can only detect a small proportion of all possible damage in a sewer. The inspection outcome of such systems relies not only on the quality of the acquired images, but also on the off-line. recognition and classification conducted by human operators. In consequence, CCTV-based platforms are frequently not effective. Infrared, microwave, optical, and ultrasonic-based sensors have been proposed to complement the existing CCTV-based approach and to improve inspection results. New inspection devices employing multiple sensors and being capable of carrying out remote sewer inspection tasks are under research.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2002.1000245","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1000245","","Inspection;Cameras;Optical sensors;Safety;Circuits;TV;Image recognition;Humans;Infrared sensors;Microwave devices","inspection;closed circuit television;ultrasonic applications;infrared detectors;infrared imaging;optical sensors;radar applications;measurement by laser beam;ultrasonic transducers;reviews;buried object detection;television applications","reviews;automated inspection devices;sewer inspection;environmental concerns;safety;communal sewers;wheeled platform;closed circuit television camera;CCTV camera;infrared sensors;microwave sensors;optical sensors;ultrasonic-based sensors;US sensors;multiple sensors;remote inspection tasks;ground penetrating radar;IR thermography;laser profilometry;pipe inspection;sonar","","81","","61","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing methods either have poor performance or result in artifacts. A new method for projecting and backprojecting rays through pixels is presented that has good performance and eliminates artifacts, and could potentially enable routine iterative reconstruction in clinical CT systems. The new method, which we call distance-driven, reconciles the advantages of the common pixel-driven and ray-driven methods. It avoids an artifact-inducing approximation made by the previous methods and has very favorable computational properties. The method is applicable to parallel-beam, fanbeam, and cone-beam geometries. Its performance and artifact behavior are evaluated on a two-dimensional fan-beam geometry with flat detector and compared to the pixel-driven and ray-driven approaches. The distance-driven method prevents the artifacts that are generated in the pixel-driven projection and in the ray-driven backprojection. It outperforms pixel-driven and ray-driven methods from a computational standpoint and is amenable to hardware implementation.","","0-7803-7636-6","10.1109/NSSMIC.2002.1239600","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1239600","","Detectors;Computed tomography;Image reconstruction;X-ray imaging;Geometry;Hardware;Image converters;Computational modeling;Iterative methods;Image generation","computerised tomography","projection;backprojection;computed tomography;distance-driven;parallel-beam;fanbeam;cone-beam;artifact","","13","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We study the performance of the zero forcing receiver (used to recover the transmitted data stream) in flat fading channels with transmit correlation. The results for interference rejection in i.i.d. environments presented by Salz, Winters and Gitlin (1994) may be interpreted in a MIMO single user context to conclude that the zero forcing receiver achieves M /sub r/ -M/sub t/ + 1 order diversity on each stream. We provide an alternative derivation based on Wishart matrix analysis for the same result. In addition our formulation allows the inclusion of transmit correlation in the channel. We show that the SNR on each decoded strewn is a weighted Chi-squared variable with 2(M/sub r/ $M/sub t/ + 1) degrees of freedom. The weight characterizes the degradation in SNR and is accurately quantified by the corresponding diagonal element of the inverse of the transmit correlation matrix.","","0-7803-7501-7","10.1109/ISIT.2002.1023431","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1023431","","MIMO;Degradation;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Signal to noise ratio;Samarium;Fading;Interference;Decoding;Rayleigh channels","radio receivers;radiofrequency interference;interference suppression;diversity reception;correlation methods;matrix inversion;Rayleigh channels;MIMO systems","zero forcing receiver performance;transmit correlation;spatial multiplexing;spatial signaling;high spectral efficiency;MIMO wireless communication links;interference rejection;i.i.d. environments;diversity reception;SNR;Wishart matrix analysis;weighted Chi-squared variable;inverse transmit correlation matrix;Rayleigh flat fading","","113","","2","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The U-shaped patch antenna is fed electromagnetically by another coaxially-fed patch on the same layer, which operates at a higher frequency band. In this paper, we first proposed a new technique to obtain two closely staggered resonant modes to achieve a wide impedance bandwidth using two unequal arms of the U-shaped patch for the lower band. For the substrate thickness = 5, 7.5 and 11 mm, the measured bandwidths of the antennas operating around at 900 MHz are 7%, 10%, and 18%, respectively. Then, we modify the coaxially-fed patch so that both bands are wide in bandwidth. The resulting antenna operating at 900 and 1800-MHz bands with the substrate thickness 11 mm has a measured impedance bandwidth of 13.3% and 20 respectively. This thickness corresponds to 0.033 free-space wavelength at 900 MHz. The far-field radiation patterns are stable in the two operating bands. The proposed antenna is simple in structure compared with the regular stacked or coplanar parasitic patch antennas. It is highly suitable for indoor mobile communications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2002.801285","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1034998","","Patch antennas;Arm;Broadband antennas;Bandwidth;Coaxial components;Impedance;Antenna measurements;Thickness measurement;Frequency;Resonance","mobile antennas;multifrequency antennas;UHF antennas;microstrip antennas;antenna radiation patterns;indoor radio;electric impedance;antenna feeds;land mobile radio","quarter-wave U-shaped patch antenna;wideband operation;dual-frequency operation;unequal arms;FR4 substrate;coaxially-fed patch;closely staggered resonant modes;wide impedance bandwidth;substrate thickness;free-space wavelength;far-field radiation patterns;coplanar parasitic patch antenna;stacked antenna;indoor mobile communications;UHF;900 MHz;1800 MHz","","55","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For such system of multiple aircraft, we consider the path planning problem among given waypoints avoiding all possible conflicts. In particular we are interested in optimal paths, i.e., we want to minimize the total flight time. We propose two different formulations of the multiaircraft conflict avoidance problem as a mixed-integer linear program: in the first case only velocity changes are admissible maneuvers, in the second one only heading angle changes are allowed.

The algorithm is illustrated with a brief simulation study.","1558-2523","","10.1109/9.983370","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=983370","","Control systems;Safety;Law;Legal factors;Automatic control;Control system synthesis;Supervisory control;Algebra;NASA","discrete time systems;sampled data systems;optimal control;control nonlinearities;transfer functions;closed loop systems;poles and zeros;stability","extremum seeking control;discrete-time systems;linear input dynamics;static nonlinearity;linear output dynamics;two-time scale averaging theory;mild sufficient condition;modulation signal;positive realness","","129","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Taiwan Univ., Taipei, Taiwan; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","","2002","17","1","33","46","This paper presents a new fault location algorithm based on phasor measurement units (PMUs) for series compensated lines. Traditionally, the voltage drop of a series device is computed by the device model in the fault locator of series compensated lines, but when using this approach errors are induced by the inaccuracy of the series device model or the uncertainty operation mode of the series device. The proposed algorithm does not utilize the series device model and knowledge of the operation mode of the series device to compute the voltage drop during the fault period. Instead, the proposed algorithm uses two-step algorithm, prelocation step and correction step, to calculate the voltage drop and fault location. The proposed technique can be easily applied to any series FACTS compensated line. EMTP generated data using a 30-km 34-kV transmission line has been used to test the accuracy of the proposed algorithm. The tested cases include various fault types, fault locations, fault resistances, fault inception angles, etc. The study also considers the effect of various operation modes of the compensated device during the fault period. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm can achieve up to 99.95% accuracy for most tested cases.","1937-4208","","10.1109/61.974185","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=974185","","Fault location;Voltage;Capacitors;Power system transients;Power system protection;Power system stability;Thyristors;Phasor measurement units;Testing;Power system simulation","flexible AC transmission systems;fault location;power system measurement;compensation;power transmission faults;power transmission lines;thyristor applications","fault location algorithm;phasor measurement units;series compensated lines;voltage drop;series device;uncertainty operation mode;operation mode;two-step algorithm;prelocation step;correction step;series FACTS compensated line;EMTP generated data;transmission line;fault resistances;fault inception angles;synchronized phasor measurement units;TCSC;thyristor controlled series compensator;30 km;34 kV","","104","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This should help the reader to develop a systematic understanding of the sensorless techniques that have been developed over the past two decades. The inherent vulnerability to mechanical failures, extra cost, and size associated with external position sensors such as optical encoders, resolvers, and custom-designed Hall-effect sensors has motivated many researchers to develop sensorless control techniques for SRM drives. Ideally, it is desirable to have a sensorless scheme, which uses only terminal measurements and does not require additional hardware or memory while maintaining a reliable operation over the entire speed and torque range with high resolution and accuracy. Advances in the development of low-cost digital-signal-processor-based microcontrollers have paved the way for the fulfillment of this objective. It is, furthermore, our view that the existing trends in the development of more powerful processors will ultimately replace the concept of sensorless controls with the concept of eliminating the need for position sensing, a concept that will further revolutionize the motor drive technology.","1557-9948","","10.1109/41.982246","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=982246","","Reluctance motors;Sensorless control;Reluctance machines;Optical sensors;Costs;Mechanical sensors;Hall effect devices;Torque measurement;Velocity measurement;Hardware","reluctance motor drives;variable speed drives;position control;machine control;digital signal processing chips;digital control;microcontrollers","custom-designed Hall-effect sensors;sensorless control;switched reluctance motor drives;SRM drives;state of the art;terminal measurements;speed range;torque range;high resolution;high accuracy;low-cost digital-signal-processor-based microcontrollers;adjustable-speed motor drives;motor controls;variable reluctance motors","","113","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Leino","NA; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Wireless Communications","","2002","9","2","14","18","The WCDMA air interface was initially designed to support a wide variety of services with different QoS requirements having a maximum bit rate of 2 Mb/s. In order to satisfy the future service and application needs several technical enhancements are being studied and standardized for WCDMA in 3GPP. Even with evolved WCDMA, there is a need for another public wireless access solution to cover the demand for data-intensive applications and enable smooth online access to corporate data services in hot spots. This need could be fulfilled by WLAN together with a high-data-rate cellular WCDMA system. WLAN offers an interesting possibility for cellular operators to offer additional capacity and higher bandwidths for end users without sacrificing the capacity of cellular users. The evolved WCDMA air interface will provide better performance and higher bit rates than basic WCDMA, based on first releases of the specifications. Eventually, evolution may not be the answer to all the needs, and come revolutionary concepts need to be considered. However, before some future wireless system can be regarded as belonging to 4G it must possess capabilities that by far exceed those of 3G systems like WCDMA. Judging from an application and services point of view, one distinguishing factor between 3G and 4G will still be the data rate. We could define that 4G should support at least 100 Mb/s peak data rates in full-mobility wide area coverage and 1 Gb/s in low-mobility local area coverage. Other possible characteristics of 4G need to be further studied.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.2002.998520","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=998520","","Multiaccess communication;Wireless LAN;Downlink;Delay;Standardization;Throughput;Modulation coding;GSM;Time division multiple access;Bit rate","code division multiple access;multiuser channels;broadband networks;wireless LAN;cellular radio;quality of service;data communication;business communication;network interfaces","WLAN;QoS requirements;3GPP;public wireless access;data-intensive applications;online access;corporate data services;high-data-rate cellular WCDMA system;cellular operators;bandwidth;wireless system;4G mobile systems;3G mobile systems;wide area coverage;low-mobility local area coverage;WCDMA air interface;2 Mbit/s;100 Mbit/s;1 Gbit/s","","71","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Without sufficient clutter rejection, low velocity blood flow cannot be measured, and estimates of higher velocities will have a large bias. The small number of samples available (8 to 16) makes clutter filtering in color flow imaging a challenging problem. In this paper, we review and analyze three classes of filters: finite impulse response (FIR), infinite impulse response (IIR), and regression filters. The quality of the filters was assessed based on the frequency response, as well as on the bias and variance of a mean blood velocity estimator using an autocorrelation technique. For FIR filters, the frequency response was improved by allowing a non-linear phase response. By estimating the mean blood flow velocity from two vectors filtered in the forward and backward direction, respectively, the standard deviation was significantly lower with a minimum phase filter than with a linear phase filter. For IIR filters applied to short signals, the transient part of the output signal is important. We analyzed zero, step, and projection initialization, and found that projection initialization gave the best filters. For regression filters, polynomial basis functions provide effective clutter suppression. The best filters from each of the three classes gave comparable bias and variance of the mean blood velocity estimates. However, polynomial regression filters and projection-initialized IIR filters had a slightly better frequency response than could be obtained with FIR filters.","1525-8955","","10.1109/58.985705","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=985705","","Ultrasonic imaging;Finite impulse response filter;IIR filters;Frequency response;Nonlinear filters;Blood flow;Polynomials;Fluid flow measurement;Velocity measurement;Ultrasonic variables measurement","biomedical ultrasonics;medical image processing;FIR filters;IIR filters;frequency response;clutter;transient response;blood flow measurement;acoustic signal processing;flow visualisation","ultrasound color flow imaging;clutter filter design;stationary slowly moving tissue;low velocity blood flow;finite impulse response filters;infinite impulse response filters;regression filters;frequency response;mean blood velocity estimator;autocorrelation technique;nonlinear phase response;projection initialization;polynomial basis functions;effective clutter suppression;Doppler blood flow measurements;state space formulation;transient response;computational complexity","Blood Flow Velocity;Computer Simulation;Equipment Design;Mathematics;Ultrasonography, Doppler, Color","163","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although large caches can significantly improve performance, they have the potential to increase power consumption. As feature sizes shrink the dominant component of this power loss will be leakage. However, during a fixed period of time the activity in a cache is only centered on a small subset of the lines. This behavior can be exploited to cut the leakage power of large caches by putting the cold cache lines into a state preserving, low-power drowsy mode. Moving lines into and out of drowsy state incurs a slight performance loss. In this paper we investigate policies and circuit techniques for implementing drowsy caches. We show that with simple architectural techniques, about 80%-90% of the cache lines can be maintained in a drowsy state without affecting performance by more than 1%. According to our projections, in a 0.07 um CMOS process, drowsy caches will be able to reduce the total energy (static and dynamic) consumed in the caches by 50%-75%. We also argue that the use of drowsy caches can simplify the design and control of low-leakage caches, and avoid the need to completely turn off selected cache lines and lose their state.","1063-6897","0-7695-1605-X","10.1109/ISCA.2002.1003572","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1003572","","Dynamic voltage scaling;Voltage control;Energy consumption;Computer architecture;Circuit simulation;Threshold voltage;Leakage current;Inverters;Semiconductor device modeling;Predictive models","cache storage;power consumption;CMOS memory circuits;total energy;memory architecture","drowsy caches;leakage power reduction;power consumption;cold cache lines;leakage energy;cache memory;ABB-MTCMOS;CMOS circuits","","243","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, it is sensitive to noisy interference such as illumination changes and quantization errors. Furthermore, CCHs large dimension or histogram bins requires large computation on histogram comparison. To address these concerns, this paper presents a new color histogram representation, called fuzzy color histogram (FCH), by considering the color similarity of each pixel's color associated to all the histogram bins through fuzzy-set membership function. A novel and fast approach for computing the membership values based on fuzzy c-means algorithm is introduced. The proposed FCH is further exploited in the application of image indexing and retrieval. Experimental results clearly show that FCH yields better retrieval results than CCH.

The resulting approach is suitable for generating both high-speed scans of moving objects when projecting a single stripe pattern and high-resolution scans of static scenes using a short sequence of time-shifted stripe patterns.

Centre, Ottawa, Ont., Canada","IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","","2002","20","6","1133","1143","A significant number of propagation and channel modeling papers have reported channel parameters like RMS delay spread, correlation bandwidth, and the Rician K factor, derived by various new methods from instantaneous, or snapshot measurements. This conflicts with the original definitions of these parameters, which formally should be derived from time averages, under an assumption of ergodicity and applied for the assessment of time-averaged link performance. It appears that the origins of fading channel characterization parameters, and the conditions under which they can be estimated and applied are now often ignored, leaving interpretation of new results subject to skepticism. This paper, therefore, provides a critical review of the estimation of frequency correlation and one of these parameters, correlation bandwidth, using channel impulse response estimates derived from propagation measurements. The practical application for knowledge of frequency correlation is summarized. Then, the derivation of the equation relating a channel's average power delay profile to its frequency correlation function via a Fourier transform is reviewed, with emphasis on conditions needed for validity. An alternate method, free from most of these conditions is also reported. Examples are given and comparisons are made of results from analyses using the two methods to estimate frequency correlation on Rayleigh and Rician mobile radio channels, which are shown to have significantly different frequency correlation characteristics. Finally, a measure of frequency correlation that is free from ambiguity concerning the value (e.g., 0.5, 0.75, or 1/e) at the correlation band edges is recommended.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2002.801212","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1021905","","Frequency estimation;Frequency measurement;Fading;Bandwidth;Intersymbol interference;Rician channels;Delay estimation;Fourier transforms;Quantum computing;Error analysis","Rayleigh channels;Rician channels;radiowave propagation;correlation methods;frequency estimation;transient response;land mobile radio;Fourier transforms;radio links","frequency correlation functions estimation;propagation measurements;fading radio channels;review;channel modeling;channel parameters;RMS delay spread;correlation bandwidth;Rician K factor;time-averaged link performance;fading channel;channel impulse response estimates;average power delay profile;frequency correlation function;Fourier transform;Rician mobile radio channels;Rayleigh mobile radio channels;frequency correlation characteristics;frequency correlation","","66","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The CSF approach is a more realistic and flexible framework for modeling imperfect competition than other models for three reasons. First, the models include as a special case the Cournot conjecture that rivals will not change production if prices change; thus, the CSF framework is more general. Second, Cournot models cannot be used when price elasticity of demand is zero, but the proposed models can. Third, unlike supply function equilibrium models, CSF equilibria can be calculated for large transmission networks. Existence and uniqueness properties for prices and profits are reported.

However, the antenna is capable of single-band operation only. A novel dual-band F-shaped monopole antenna, which can easily be integrated on a circuit board, is proposed. The antenna comprises a vertical metal line and two (one upper and one lower) horizontal metal lines of different lengths, which are used for tuning the antenna's first two resonant frequencies to achieve dual-band operation in the 2.4 GHz (2.4-2.484 GHz) and 5.2 GHz (5.15-5.35 GHz) bands for WLAN applications. The proposed antenna printed and integrated on a small region of a microwave substrate has a compact size of 10/spl times/15 mm/sup 2/ and is easily fed by a 50 /spl Omega/ microstrip line printed on the same microwave substrate. Details of the design considerations for achieving dual-band operation, and experimental results of a constructed prototype for operating in the 2.4 and 5.2 GHz bands are presented.","","0-7803-7330-8","10.1109/APS.2002.1016929","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1016929","","Dual band;Wireless LAN;Printed circuits;Microstrip antennas;Bluetooth;Fabrication;Costs;Circuit optimization;Tuning;Resonant frequency","microwave antennas;monopole antennas;wireless LAN;Bluetooth;multifrequency antennas;UHF antennas;antenna radiation patterns","dual-band F-shaped monopole antenna;WLAN application;wireless local area network;Bluetooth application;antenna volume reduction;fabrication cost;WLAN antenna;circuit board;communication device;single-band operation;vertical metal line;horizontal metal lines;resonant frequencies;microwave substrate;microstrip line;antenna gain;antenna radiation patterns;UHF;SHF;2.4 to 2.484 GHz;5.15 to 5.35 GHz;50 ohm","","27","","2","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The model is calibrated for a set of vehicles driven on standard as well as aggressive driving cycles. The model is validated on another driving cycle in order to, test its estimation capabilities. The preliminary results indicate that the model gives reasonable results compared to actual measurements as well as to results obtained with CMEM, a well-known load-based emission model.

Specifically, they consider decentralized controllers such as proportional-integral-derivative-based and sliding-mode ones and model-based controllers such as the classical computed-torque one and a neural-network-based controller. A simple procedure for the estimation of the dynamic model of the manipulator is given. Experimental results provide a detailed framework about the cost/benefit ratio regarding the use of the different controllers, showing that the performance obtained with decentralized controllers may suffice in a large number of industrial applications, but in order to achieve low tracking errors also for high-speed trajectories, it might be convenient to adopt a neural-network-based control scheme, whose implementation is not particularly demanding.","1557-9948","","10.1109/41.982266","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=982266","","Trajectory;Industrial control;Service robots;Sliding mode control;Robotic assembly;Manipulator dynamics;Proportional control;Electrical equipment industry;Control systems;Error correction","industrial manipulators;position control;tracking;assembling;decentralised control;three-term control;variable structure systems;model reference adaptive control systems;neurocontrollers","industrial SCARA robot manipulators;trajectory tracking control;control strategies;control performance;industrial selective compliance assembly robot arm robot;decentralized controllers;proportional-integral-derivative controllers;sliding-mode controllers;model-based controllers;neural-network-based controller;computed-torque controller;cost-benefit ratio;tracking errors;PID control;high-speed trajectories","","59","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Results obtained were compared to measurements made using the conventional electrical detection method. The quantification of the capacitive coupler measured signal in mV with a discharge apparent quantity in pC has been investigated and an on-line quantification method proposed. The capacitive coupler has good detection sensitivity and PD location can be realised by studying the time of Right between signals from two sensors. The difference in pulse shape, spectrum and time of flight between an internal discharge and external interference has been investigated. The AE approach has the advantage of being free from electrical interference. However, investigation indicated that AE signals were significantly attenuated within the cable joint. RFCTs were used to detect the discharge current flowing through the cable sheath.

The result would be the occurrence of voltage collapse which leads to total blackout to the whole system. Therefore voltage collapse prediction is important in power system planning and operation so that the occurrence of voltage collapse due to voltage instability could be avoided. Line outage in a power system could also lead to the event of voltage collapse which implies the contingency in the system. Line outage contingencies are ranked so that the line which highly affects voltage stability of the system when there is an outage occurs in this line could be identified. The contingency ranking process can be conducted by computing the line stability index of each line for a particular line outage and sort them in descending order. The contingency which is ranked highest implies that it contributes to system instability. This paper presents a new voltage stability index refers to a line namely fast voltage stability index (FVSI). The values of the line indices indicate the voltage stability condition in the system and it is used to rank the line outage contingency. The information from the contingency ranking denotes the severity of the voltage stability condition in a power system due to line outage.

Interestingly, the neural classifier achieves this performance with a few units, normally just one per mental task. Also, since the subject and his/her personal interface learn simultaneously from each other, subjects master it rapidly (in a few days of moderate training).

Unfortunately, when the impulse response is dispersive, the PNLMS converges much slower than NLMS. This implies that the rule proposed in PNLMS is far from optimal. In many simulations, it seems that we fully benefit from PNLMS only when the impulse response is close to a delta function.

This is particularly true for firms competing internationally, where the complexity of the supply chain must be managed within a global network. To explore the linkage between supply chain complexity and delivery, a two-dimensional framework is proposed that conceptualizes the degree of complexity embedded in a supply chain along two major dimensions: (1) form of technology and (2) nature of information processing. Technology is characterized using a conventional operations strategy framework of structural and infrastructural elements. In contrast, information processing captures both the level of complicatedness and of uncertainty that exists in the supply chain. Collectively, these two dimensions create a two-by-two framework that defines supply chain complexity and provides a strong theoretical basis for linking different aspects of complexity to delivery performance. An exploratory empirical investigation using an international database focused on immediate upstream and downstream echelons of a supply chain at the firm level. Results show strong support for the linkages between delivery performance and both complicatedness of the product/process and uncertainty of the management systems. In contrast, little evidence was found that greater product variety and more complicated supply networks adversely affected performance. Thus, management initiatives to improve delivery performance are best focused on improving informational flows within the supply chain and leveraging new process technologies that offer flexibility to respond to uncertainty.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2002.803387","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1046056","","Management","management","supply chain complexity;just-in-time delivery;delivery performance;supply chain management;information processing;infrastructural elements;structural elements;uncertainty;two-by-two framework;international database;management systems uncertainty;management initiatives","","115","","75","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Wideband smart antenna theory using rectangular array structures","M. Ghavami","Sony Comput. Sci. Labs. Inc., Tokyo, Japan","IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","","2002","50","9","2143","2151","Smart antenna techniques at the base station can dramatically improve the performance of the mobile radio system by employing spatial filtering. The design of a fully spatial signal processor using rectangular array configuration is proposed. Two-dimensional (2-D) spatial filters that can be implemented by microstrip technology are capable of filtering the received signal in the angular domain as well as the frequency domain. Furthermore, it has wideband properties and, hence, eliminates the requirement of different antenna spacing for applications including various carrier frequencies. The desired frequency selectivity of the smart antenna can be combined with compensation of the undesired frequency performance of a single antenna element, and the result is quite satisfactory for practical implementation. In addition, if the elements of the array are not perfectly omnidirectional or frequency independent, we can compensate for these deficiencies in the design algorithm. Two different algorithms for calculating the real-valued weights of the antenna elements are proposed. The first algorithm is more complex but leads to sharper beams and controlled performance. The second method is simpler but has wider beam and lower fractional bandwidth. Some computer simulation results demonstrating the directional beam patterns of the designed beamformers are also presented.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2002.801891","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1025576","","Broadband antennas;Antenna theory;Antenna arrays;Frequency;Signal processing algorithms;Microstrip antenna arrays;Filtering;Mobile antennas;Base stations;Land mobile radio","adaptive antenna arrays;land mobile radio;spatial filters;filtering theory;microstrip filters;array signal processing;matrix inversion;discrete Fourier transforms;linear antenna arrays;direction-of-arrival estimation;antenna theory","wideband smart antenna theory;rectangular array structures;base station;mobile radio system;spatial filtering;spatial signal processor;rectangular array configuration;two-dimensional spatial filters;2D spatial filters;microstrip technology;angular domain;frequency domain;antenna spacing;carrier frequencies;frequency selectivity;design algorithm;matrix inversion beamforming network;IDFT;DOA;beamwidth control;inverse discrete Fourier transform;linear antenna array;real-valued weights;antenna elements;fractional bandwidth;computer simulation results;directional beam patterns","","82","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Efficient space-time codes have been developed that utilize a large portion of the available capacity. These codes are designed under the assumption that the transmitter has no knowledge about the channel. In this work, on the other hand, we consider the case when the transmitter has partial, but not perfect, knowledge about the channel and how to improve a predetermined code so that this fact is taken into account. A performance criterion is derived for a frequency-nonselective fading channel and then utilized to optimize a linear transformation of the predetermined code. The resulting optimization problem turns out to be convex and can thus be efficiently solved using standard methods. In addition, a particularly efficient solution method is developed for the special case of independently fading channel coefficients. The proposed transmission scheme combines the benefits of conventional beamforming with those given by orthogonal space-time block coding. Simulation results for a narrow-band system with multiple transmit antennas and one or more receive antennas demonstrate significant gains over conventional methods in a scenario with nonperfect channel knowledge.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.985950","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=985950","","Array signal processing","array signal processing;adaptive antenna arrays;receiving antennas;transmitting antennas;block codes;fading channels;diversity reception;optimisation;maximum likelihood decoding","orthogonal space-time block coding;beamforming;multiple transmit antennas;multiple receive antennas;wireless systems;high data rate communication;transmitter;performance criterion;frequency-nonselective fading channel;linear transformation;convex optimization problem;independently fading channel coefficients;simulation results;narrow-band system;nonperfect channel knowledge;array processing;antenna arrays;maximum-likelihood decoding","","411","","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By means of eigenvalue/eigenvector theory to decouple the mutual coupling effects between parallel lines, the fault detection and location indices are derived. The two proposed indices are used in coordination such that the internal and external fault events can be distinguished completely. By on-line estimation of the line parameters under the actual power system conditions, the proposed scheme will respond more accurately to power system faults. Extensive simulation results using EMTP have verified that the accuracy of the fault location achieved is up to 99.9%. The proposed protection system responds well and fast with regard to dependability and security.

Selection is dependent upon the size of the generator and the stiffness of the connecting utility bus. For large generators where the kVA is significant, these machines are usually terminal voltage regulated and dictate the system's bus voltage. When smaller terminal voltage regulated generators are synchronized to a stiff utility bus, the system voltage will not change as the smaller generator shares reactive loading. However, if the system voltage changes significantly, the smaller generator, with its continuous acting terminal voltage regulator, will attempt to maintain the voltage set point. As the voltage regulator follows its characteristic curve, it may cause either over or under excitation of the smaller generator. Excessive system voltage may cause a small generator to lose synchronizing torque, while low system voltage may cause excessive heating on the generator or excessive overcurrent operation of the excitation system. Maintaining a constant reactive load on the smaller generating unit can reduce the generator field current variations and, thus, reduce the maintenance of the collector rings and brushes. This paper illustrates the effect of changing system bus voltage on small generators utilizing voltage versus VAr/PF regulation.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2002.805560","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1058126","","Reactive power;Synchronous generators;Voltage control;System buses;Regulators;Joining processes;Character generation;Torque;Low voltage;Heating","synchronous generators;machine control;control system synthesis;voltage control;reactive power control;power factor correction;machine theory;control system analysis","synchronous generators;voltage regulation;VAr/power factor regulation;utility bus;voltage set point;synchronizing torque;collector rings;brushes;maintenance;bus voltage","","32","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared to other double edge-triggered flip-flops, PDET offers advantages in terms of speed, power, and area. Both total transistor count and the number of clocked transistors are significantly reduced to improve power consumption and speed in the flip-flop.

Mismatching flows are rate-limited in proportion to their aggressiveness. D-WARD offers good service to legitimate traffic even during an attack, while effectively reducing DDoS traffic to a negligible level. A prototype of the system has been built in a Linux router.

Previously, the migration from IPv4 to IPv6 has been considered nontrivial, a factor generally attributed to thwarting its success. However, with the advent of a number of new transitioning techniques the evolution to IPv6 is now becoming increasingly feasible. These transitioning techniques offer tunneling and translation solutions that enable the gradual introduction of IPv6 support into an existing IPv4 infrastructure. Nevertheless, it is not yet clear what form this evolution is likely to take, which phases are likely to exist, and how the transition process will proceed. This article examines existing IETF IPv6 transitioning mechanisms and discusses the key issues involved in IPv6 deployment. We examine those aspects that potentially affect the choice of transition mechanisms and look at what factors are likely to mould the evolutionary path.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2002.1007420","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1007420","","Protocols;Internet;Tunneling;Space technology;Technology management;Data structures;Sockets;Web server;Switches;Laboratories","transport protocols;Internet","IPv6 protocol;transitioning techniques;tunneling solutions;translation solutions;IPv4 infrastructure;IETF;IPv6 transitioning mechanisms;economic factors;network infrastructure;legacy applications;Internet;routing protocols;IPv6 deployment;Internet Engineering Task Force","","48","","1","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Fuzzy entropy is used as a measure of the error of the segmentation system as well as a criterion for determining potential edge pixels. The proposed system is capable to perform automatic multilevel segmentation of images, based solely on information contained by the image itself. No a priori assumptions whatsoever are made about the image (type, features, contents, stochastic model, etc.). Such an ""universal"" algorithm is most useful for applications that are supposed to work with different (and possibly initially unknown) types of images.

The function of the IGBT inverter is to support utility fundamental voltage and to compensate for the fundamental reactive power. The MOSFET inverter fulfills the function of harmonic current compensation. To further reduce cost and to simplify control, the IGBT and MOSFET inverters share the same DC-link via a split capacitor bank.

The word balun is an acronym for balanced-to-unbalanced converter, and the function is employed to change a single-ended signal, i.e., a signal that is referenced to ground, to a balanced signal with equal potentials with respect to ground but opposite polarity. These balun structures are employed in such common RF and. microwave components as mixers' antenna-feed networks, and frequency multipliers. In this paper some common balun structures are investigated using the electromagnetic simulation software package Microwave Office, available from Applied Wave Research.

"Nanophotonics: design, fabrication, and operation of nanometric devices using optical near fields","M. Ohtsu; K. Kobayashi; T. Kawazoe; S. Sangu; T. Yatsui","Interdisciplinary Graduate Sch. of Sci. & Eng., Tokyo Inst. of Technol., Yokohama, Japan; NA; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","","2002","8","4","839","862","This paper reviews progress in nanophotonics, a novel optical nanotechnology, utilizing local electromagnetic interactions between a few nanometric elements and an optical near field. A prototype of a nanophotonic integrated circuit (IC) is presented, in which the optical near field is used as a carrier to transmit a signal from one nanometric dot to another. Each section of this paper reviews theoretical and experimental studies carried out to assess the possibility of designing, fabricating, and operating each nanophotonic IC device. A key device, the nanophotonic switch, is proposed based on optical near-field energy transfer between quantum dots (QDs). The optical near-field interaction is expressed as the sum of the Yukawa function, and the oscillation period of the nutation of cubic CuCl QDs is estimated to be less than 100 ps. To guarantee one-directional (i.e., irreversible) energy transfer between two resonant levels of QDs, intrasublevel transitions due to phonon coupling are examined by considering a simple two-QD plus phonon heat bath system. As a result, the state-filling time is estimated as 22 ps for CuCl QDs. This time is almost independent of the temperature in the Born-Markov approximation. Using cubic CuCl QDs in a NaCl matrix as a test sample, the optical near-field energy transfer was experimentally verified by near-field optical spectroscopy with a spatial resolution smaller than 50 nm in the near-UV region at 15 K. This transfer occurs from the lowest state of excitons in 4.6-nm QDs to the first dipole-forbidden excited state of excitons in 6.3-nm QDs. To fabricate nanophotonic devices and ICs, chemical vapor deposition using an optical near field is proposed; this is sufficiently precise in controlling the size and position of the deposited material. A novel deposition scheme under nonresonant conditions is also demonstrated and its origin is discussed. In order to confirm the possibility of using a nanometric ZnO dot as a light emitter in a nanophotonic IC, spatially and spectrally resolved photoluminescence imaging of individual ZnO nanocrystallites was carried out with a spatial resolution as high as 55 nm, using a UV fiber probe, and the spectral shift due to the quantum size effect was found. To connect the nanophotonic IC to external photonic devices, a nanometer-scale waveguide was developed using a metal-coated silicon wedge structure. Illumination (wavelength: 830 nm) of the metal-coated silicon wedge (width: 150 nm) excites a TM plasmon mode with a beam width of 150 nm and propagation length of 2.5 /spl mu/m. A key device for nanophotonics, an optical near-field probe with an extremely high throughput, was developed by introducing a pyramidal silicon structure with localized surface plasmon resonance at the metallized probe tip. A throughput as high as 2.3% was achieved. Finally, as an application of nanophotonics to, a high-density, high-speed optical memory system, a novel contact slider with a pyramidal silicon probe array was developed. This slider was used for phase-change recording and reading, and a mark length as short as 110 nm was demonstrated.","1558-4542","","10.1109/JSTQE.2002.801738","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1039477","","Optical devices;Nanophotonics;Optical design;Optical device fabrication;Nanoscale devices;High speed optical techniques;Probes;Silicon;Photonic integrated circuits;Energy exchange","zinc compounds;II-VI semiconductors;nanotechnology;optical design techniques;optical fabrication;phonons;excitons;integrated optoelectronics;photoluminescence;plasmons;optical storage;near-field scanning optical microscopy;semiconductor quantum dots","nanophotonics design;nanophotonics fabrication;nanometric devices;optical near fields;optical nanotechnology;local electromagnetic interactions;nanometric elements;nanophotonic integrated circuit;nanometric dot;nanophotonic IC device;optical near-field energy transfer;Yukawa function;oscillation period;resonant levels;phonon coupling;phonon heat bath system;Born-Markov approximation;excitons;dipole-forbidden excited state;chemical vapor deposition;spectrally resolved photoluminescence imaging;ZnO nanocrystallites;nanophotonic IC;UV fiber probe;spectral shift;quantum size effect;external photonic devices;metal-coated silicon wedge;TM plasmon mode;pyramidal silicon structure;localized surface plasmon resonance;high-speed optical memory;phase-change recording;100 ps;22 ps;15 K;6.3 nm;4.6 nm;830 nm;150 nm;2.5 micron;CuCl","","204","","83","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Eng., Univ. of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","","2002","11","12","1442","1449","We propose a novel and simple fast block-matching algorithm (BMA), called adaptive rood pattern search (ARPS), which consists of two sequential search stages: (1) initial search and (2) refined local search. For each macroblock (MB), the initial search is performed only once at the beginning in order to find a good starting point for the follow-up refined local search. By doing so, unnecessary intermediate search and the risk of being trapped into local minimum matching error points could be greatly reduced in long search case. For the initial search stage, an adaptive rood pattern (ARP) is proposed, and the ARP's size is dynamically determined for each MB, based on the available motion vectors (MVs) of the neighboring MBs. In the refined local search stage, a unit-size rood pattern (URP) is exploited repeatedly, and unrestrictedly, until the final MV is found. To further speed up the search, zero-motion prejudgment (ZMP) is incorporated in our method, which is particularly beneficial to those video sequences containing small motion contents. Extensive experiments conducted based on the MPEG-4 Verification Model (VM) encoding platform show that the search speed of our proposed ARPS-ZMP is about two to three times faster than that of the diamond search (DS), and our method even achieves higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) particularly for those video sequences containing large and/or complex motion contents.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2002.806251","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176932","","Motion estimation;Video sequences;MPEG 4 Standard;Virtual manufacturing;PSNR;Video coding;Transform coding;Computer errors;Encoding;Video compression","data compression;video coding;search problems;image matching;motion estimation;adaptive signal processing","adaptive rood pattern search;fast block-matching motion estimation;fast block-matching algorithm;sequential search;initial search;refined local search;macroblock;video coding;motion vectors;unit-size rood pattern;zero-motion prejudgment;video sequences;motion content;MPEG-4 Verification Model encoding platform;ARPS-ZMP;diamond search;peak signal-to-noise ratio;PSNR","","348","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The antenna systems can be fully characterized by 21 parameters, of which only five need to be provided by the antenna designer, as the remaining 16 parameters can be derived in closed form using the procedure described here. In this paper, we assume that the main reflector has a circular aperture, while the subreflector has an elliptical aperture All the antenna geometries presented satisfy the Mizugutch condition (1976), which is the geometric-optics condition for zero cross-polarized radiation.

These rovers will have the ability to navigate safely through unknown and potentially hazardous terrain, using autonomous passive stereo vision to detect potential terrain hazards before driving into them. Unfortunately, the computational power of currently available radiation hardened processors limits the amount of distance (and therefore science) that can be safely achieved by any rover in a given time frame. We present overviews of our current rover vision and navigation systems, to provide context for the types of computation that are required to navigate safely. We also present baseline timing results that represent a lower bound in achievable performance (useful for systems engineering studies of future missions), and describe ways to improve that performance using commercial grade (as opposed to radiation hardened) processors. In particular, we document speedups to our stereo vision system that were achieved using the vectorized operations provided by Pentium MMX technology. Timing data were derived from implementations on several platforms: a prototype Mars rover with flight-like electronics (the Athena Software Development Model (SDM) rover), a RAD6000 computing platform (as will be used in the 2003 MER missions), and research platforms with commercial Pentium III and Sparc processors. Finally, we summarize the radiation effects analysis that suggests that commercial grade processors are likely to be adequate for Mars surface missions, and discuss the level of speedup that may accrue from using these instead of radiation hardened parts.","","0-7803-7231-X","10.1109/AERO.2002.1035370","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1035370","","Stereo vision;Navigation;Mars;Radiation hardening;Timing;Land surface;Hazards;Machine vision;Computer vision;Power engineering computing","computer vision;stereo image processing;computerised navigation;Mars;remotely operated vehicles;planetary rovers;microprocessor chips;radiation hardening (electronics);timing;collision avoidance","rover navigation software;planetary exploration;NASA Mars Exploration Rover missions;planetary rovers;hazardous terrain;autonomous passive stereo vision;potential terrain hazards;computational power;radiation hardened processors;safe navigation;baseline timing performance;systems engineering;commercial grade processors;vectorized operations;Pentium MMX technology;timing data;flight-like electronics;Athena Software Development Model rover;RAD6000 computing platform;Pentium III processors;Sparc processors;radiation effects analysis;Mars surface missions","","153","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the cantilevers with thickness H<500 nm and length L>10 /spl mu/m, thermoelastic loss is negligible. But it becomes significant when the beam thickness H>500 nm and the length L<10 /spl mu/m. The cantilevers are very liable to air damping, hardly operated at pressure higher than 10/sup -3/ mbar. In a high vacuum (<10/sup -3/ mbar), air damping is negligible, the support and surface loss play an important role. The shorter the cantilevers, the larger the support energy loss. For the cantilevers with L/H<100, the quality factors (Q factors) are limited by the support loss. When the length L>30 /spl mu/m, the Q factors of the cantilevers are proportional to their thickness, i.e., surface loss dominates the mechanical behavior. Annealing the cantilevers of 170 nm thickness at 1000/spl deg/C for 30 s under an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) condition results in an over one order-of-magnitude increase of the Q factor, up to about 2.5/spl times/10/sup 5/ for cantilevers of 30-90 /spl mu/m in length.","1941-0158","","10.1109/JMEMS.2002.805208","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1097798","","Energy dissipation;Silicon;Force sensors;Mechanical energy;Thermoelasticity;Damping;Energy resolution;Q factor;Laser beams;Structural beams","damping;micromechanical devices;elemental semiconductors;silicon;thermoelasticity;losses;Q-factor","single-crystal cantilevers;mechanical energy losses;ultrathin micro-cantilevers;thermoelastic loss;air damping;support loss;surface loss;beam thickness;quality factors;annealing;Q factor;60 nm;170 nm;500 nm;10/sup -3/ mbar;1000 degC;30 to 90 micron;Si","","200","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Impact of current transformer saturation on overcurrent protection operation","L. A. Kojovic","Cooper Power Syst., Franksville, WI, USA","IEEE Power Engineering Society Summer Meeting,","","2002","3","","1078","1083 vol.3","If current transformer (CT) characteristics are not properly selected for fault conditions, saturation will occur which can affect protection device operation. In some applications even if CTs are properly sized, it is necessary to locate protection devices far from the CTs. In these cases, the wire resistance, which adds to the CT burden, causes CT saturation at smaller currents than when located close to the protection devices. The impact of CT saturation on protection device operation is different for different protection device types and protection schemes. This paper investigates the influence of CT saturation on overcurrent protection when protection devices are located far from the CTs, causing their saturation during faults. A study was performed to verify that delayed overcurrent protection response will not cause mis-coordination with other protection devices. It is shown that CT saturation will not significantly delay overcurrent protection operation for most common settings.","","0-7803-7518-1","10.1109/PESS.2002.1043425","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1043425","","Current transformers;Protection;Circuit faults;Fault currents;Artificial neural networks;Mathematical model;Accuracy;Computational modeling;Circuit simulation;Dynamic range","overcurrent protection;current transformers;power system protection;relay protection;power system faults","current transformer saturation;fault conditions;protection device operation;wire resistance;current transformer burden;overcurrent protection;delayed overcurrent protection response;protection relays;asymmetrical current faults;symmetrical current faults;12 kA","","20","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is the first step in cooperative control of the multiple active filters based on voltage detection for harmonic damping throughout power distribution systems. In general, the active filter should be equipped with an optimal control gain corresponding to the characteristic impedance of a distribution line. However, it is difficult to know circuit parameters of a real distribution line having various shunt capacitors and loads. Therefore, a main purpose of the gain adjustment is to make the active filter damp out harmonic propagation without considering the circuit parameters. In addition, the gain adjustment can reduce the compensating currents and losses in the active filter, and moreover it can avoid over-damping performance. Experiment results obtained from a 200-V, 20-kW laboratory system verify the effectiveness of the active filter equipped with automatic gain adjustment.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2002.1004252","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1004252","","Performance gain;Active filters;Power harmonic filters;Circuits;Voltage control;Control systems;Power system harmonics;Damping;Power distribution;Optimal control","distribution networks;damping;power system harmonics;power harmonic filters;digital control;active filters","automatic gain adjustment;fully-digital-controlled shunt active filter;co-operative control;multiple active filters;voltage detection;harmonic damping;power distribution systems;optimal control gain;distribution line impedance;circuit parameters;shunt capacitors;harmonic propagation;digital control;200 V;20 kW","","102","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Currently, the polishing physics is not well defined though it is known that the nature of the process makes particle removal after CMP difficult and necessary. It is important to understand the particle adhesion mechanisms resulting from the polishing process and the effect-of the adhering force on particle removal in post-CMP cleaning processes. In this paper, strong particle adhesion is shown to be caused by chemical reactions (after initial hydrogen bonding) that take place in the presence of moisture and long aging time. In particle removal using brush cleaning, contact between the particle and the brush is essential to the removal of submicron particles. In noncontact mode, 0.1-/spl mu/m particle can hardly be removed when the brush is more than 1 /spl mu/m away from the particle. While in full contact mode, removal is possible for a 0.1-/spl mu/m particle at the investigated brush rotational speeds. The experimental data shows that high removal efficiency (low number of defects) is possible with a high brush pressure and a short cleaning time.","1558-2345","","10.1109/TSM.2002.804872","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1134149","","Adhesives;Cleaning;Brushes;Chemicals;Lithography;Physics;Hydrogen;Bonding;Moisture;Aging","chemical mechanical polishing;adhesion;surface cleaning;deformation;planarisation;force;drag;semiconductor technology;integrated circuit manufacture;moisture;ageing","particle adhesion mechanisms;post-CMP cleaning processes;particle removal mechanisms;chemical mechanical polishing;adhering force;chemical reactions;moisture;aging;brush cleaning;submicron particles;noncontact mode;full contact mode;brush rotational speeds;high brush pressure;short cleaning time;0.1 micron;0.12 micron;1 micron","","65","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The focus of this paper is on the problem of feature extraction and classification for rear-view vehicle detection. Specifically, we propose using Gabor filters for vehicle feature extraction and support vector machines (SVM) for vehicle detection. Gabor filters provide a mechanism for obtaining some degree of invariance to intensity due to global illumination, selectivity in scale, and selectivity in orientation. Basically, they are orientation and scale tunable edge and line detectors. Vehicles do contain strong edges and lines at different orientation and scales, thus, the statistics of these features (e.g., mean, standard deviation, and skewness) could be very powerful for vehicle detection. To provide robustness, these statistics are not extracted from the whole image but rather are collected from several subimages obtained by subdividing the original image into subwindows. These features are then used to train a SVM classifier. Extensive experimentation and comparisons using real data, different features (e.g., based on principal components analysis (PCA)), and different classifiers (e.g., neural networks (NN)) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach which has achieved an average accuracy of 94.81% on completely novel test images.","","0-7803-7503-3","10.1109/ICDSP.2002.1028263","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1028263","","Vehicle detection;Gabor filters;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Image edge detection;Remotely operated vehicles;Feature extraction;Statistics;Principal component analysis;Neural networks","learning automata;feature extraction;driver information systems;automated highways;image classification;edge detection;principal component analysis;neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence)","on-road vehicle detection;Gabor filters;support vector machines;driver assistance systems;autonomous self-guided vehicles;feature extraction;classification;rear-view vehicle detection;SVM;intensity invariance;orientation tunable detectors;scale tunable detectors;edge detectors;line detectors;statistics;subimages;subwindows;principal components analysis;PCA;neural networks","","40","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The losses and the efficiency are calculated from an equivalent circuit method as well as experiments. Coil temperatures variation affects much on the efficiency. The internal cooling method is better than that of external cooling for the coil temperature reduction. Several cooling methods are compared focusing on the fan efficiency and performance, from which the values of the efficiencies of the motors are expected.

Inc., Plano, TX, USA; NA; NA","IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","","2002","20","7","1305","1314","This paper aims at finding fundamental design principles for hierarchical Web caching. An analytical modeling technique is developed to characterize an uncooperative two-level hierarchical caching system where the least recently used (LRU) algorithm is locally run at each cache. With this modeling technique, we are able to identify a characteristic time for each cache, which plays a fundamental role in understanding the caching processes. In particular, a cache can be viewed roughly as a low-pass filter with its cutoff frequency equal to the inverse of the characteristic time. Documents with access frequencies lower than this cutoff frequency have good chances to pass through the cache without cache hits. This viewpoint enables us to take any branch of the cache tree as a tandem of low-pass filters at different cutoff frequencies, which further results in the finding of two fundamental design principles. Finally, to demonstrate how to use the principles to guide the caching algorithm design, we propose a cooperative hierarchical Web caching architecture based on these principles. Both model-based and real trace simulation studies show that the proposed cooperative architecture results in more than 50% memory saving and substantial central processing unit (CPU) power saving for the management and update of cache entries compared with the traditional uncooperative hierarchical caching architecture.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2002.801752","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1031903","","Algorithm design and analysis;Cutoff frequency;Network servers;Low pass filters;Central Processing Unit;Delay;Internet;Analytical models;Service oriented architecture;Memory management","Internet;cache storage","hierarchical Web caching systems;fundamental design principles;analytical modeling technique;uncooperative two-level hierarchical caching system;least recently used algorithm;LRU algorithm;characteristic time;low-pass filter;cutoff frequency;document access frequencies;cache tree;caching algorithm design;cooperative hierarchical web caching architecture;cooperative architecture;management;update;cache entries","","217","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Feature selection, an effective dimensionality reduction technique, is an essential pre-processing method to remove noisy features. In the literature only a few methods have been proposed for feature selection for clustering, and almost all these methods are 'wrapper' techniques that require a clustering algorithm to evaluate candidate feature subsets. The wrapper approach is largely unsuitable in real-world applications due to its heavy reliance on clustering algorithms that require parameters such as the number of clusters, and the lack of suitable clustering criteria to evaluate clustering in different subspaces. In this paper we propose a 'filter' method that is independent of any clustering algorithm. The proposed method is based on the observation that data with clusters has a very different point-to-point distance histogram to that of data without clusters. By exploiting this we propose an entropy measure that is low if data has distinct clusters and high if it does not. The entropy measure is suitable for selecting the most important subset of features because it is invariant with the number of dimensions, and is affected only by the quality of clustering. Extensive performance evaluation over synthetic, benchmark, and real datasets shows its effectiveness.","","0-7695-1754-4","10.1109/ICDM.2002.1183893","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1183893","","Filters;Clustering algorithms;Entropy;Histograms;Noise reduction;Degradation;Unsupervised learning","entropy;data mining;feature extraction;pattern clustering","feature selection;knowledge discovery in databases;clustering;dimensionality reduction technique;pre-processing method;noisy feature removal;filter method;point-to-point distance histogram;entropy measure","","147","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This GSVD-based multimicrophone algorithm can be considered to be an extension of the single-microphone signal subspace algorithms for enhancing noisy speech signals and amounts to a specific optimal filtering problem when the desired response signal cannot be observed. The optimal filter can be written as a function of the generalized singular vectors and singular values of a speech and noise data matrix. A number of symmetry properties are derived for the single-microphone and multimicrophone optimal filter, which are valid for the white noise case as well as for the colored noise case. In addition, the averaging step of some single-microphone signal subspace algorithms is examined, leading to the conclusion that this averaging operation is unnecessary and even suboptimal. For simple situations, where we consider localized sources and no multipath propagation, the GSVD-based optimal filtering technique exhibits the spatial directivity pattern of a beamformer. When comparing the noise reduction performance for realistic situations, simulations show that the GSVD-based optimal filtering technique has a better performance than standard fixed and adaptive beamforming techniques for all reverberation times and that it is more robust to deviations from the nominal situation, as, e.g., encountered in uncalibrated microphone arrays.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2002.801937","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1025586","","Speech enhancement;Colored noise;Filtering algorithms;Filters;Microphone arrays;Singular value decomposition;Degradation;Additive noise;White noise;Noise reduction","speech enhancement;optimisation;filtering theory;microphones;array signal processing;singular value decomposition;noise;matrix algebra;white noise","GSVD-based optimal filtering;multimicrophone speech enhancement;single microphone speech enhancement;generalized singular value decomposition;GSVD based algorithm;single-microphone signal subspace algorithms;noisy speech signals enhancement;optimal filtering;response signal;optimal filter;generalized singular vectors;noise data matrix;speech data matrix;symmetry properties;white noise;colored noise averaging step;localized sources;spatial directivity pattern;beamformer;noise reduction performance;simulations;adaptive beamforming;reverberation times;uncalibrated microphone arrays","","239","","42","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Difficult computer vision tasks such as image segmentation and object orientation are made tractable with polarization vision techniques. Specularities, occluding contours, and material properties can be readily extracted if the Stokes polarization parameters are available. Astrophysicists employ polarization information to measure the spatial distribution of magnetic fields on the surface of the Sun. In the medical field, analysis of the polarization allows the diagnose of disease in the eyes. The retinae of most insect and certain vertebrate species are sensitive to polarization in their environment, but humans are blind to this property of light. Biologists use polarimeters to investigate behaviors of animals-vis-a-vis polarization-in their natural habitats. In this paper, we first present the basics of polarization sensing and then discuss integrated polarization imaging sensors developed in our laboratory.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2003.807946","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1178170","","Optical polarization;Magnetic field measurement;Magnetic sensors;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Computer vision;Image segmentation;Material properties;Data mining;Extraterrestrial measurements;Sun","CMOS image sensors;light polarisation;polarimeters;optical images","polarization vision techniques;CMOS imager;Stokes polarization parameters;polarization sensing;integrated polarization imaging sensors;integrated polarimeters;CMOS fabrication process","","103","","57","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, the system uses a single microphone per ear cup, thus producing a more compact, lower power consumption, cheaper solution and ease of integration with existing audio and communication devices to form an integrated feedback active noise control headset.

This paper deals with the modeling and analysis of grid connected inverters to address control issues in the above modes together with seamless transfer between modes. It is shown that the filter network configuration changes between modes and greatly impacts overall system dynamics.

However, recent advances in the theory of mathematical morphology still remain largely unexplored.

The slower gate voltage transition provides additional time for the MOSFET to compensate the coupling error on the sample and hold (S/H) capacitor, yielding a smaller clock feedthrough error.","","0-7803-7494-0","10.1109/ASIC.2002.1158052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1158052","","Clocks;Capacitors;MOSFET circuits;Voltage;Switching circuits;Power semiconductor switches;MOS devices;Semiconductor device modeling;Coupling circuits;Integrated circuit yield","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;MOSFET;field effect transistor switches;clocks;sample and hold circuits;integrated circuit modelling;error compensation;error analysis;MOS capacitors","CMOS analog transmission gate switches;clock feedthrough;transmission gate switch model;current-voltage domain model;overlap capacitors;MOSFET gate capacitors;capacitor coupling;gate voltage transition;coupling error compensation;sample and hold capacitor;clock feedthrough error","","6","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

MEMS are modeled as microstructures attached to elastic substrates, and the shocks are modeled as pulses of acceleration applied to the substrate over a finite time duration. The relevant time scales in the analysis are the acoustic transit time, the time period of vibrations, and the duration of the applied shock load. For many MEMS structures and shock loads (with durations in the range 50-5000 /spl mu/s), the substrates respond as rigid bodies and are expected to be immune to stress-wave-induced damage. Time-domain criteria, obtained to distinguish between the impulse, resonant, and quasistatic responses of the microstructures, correlate well with the experimentally observed responses of different MEMS devices. The formulation of displacement-based and stress-based failure criteria is discussed, along with their sensitivity to the applied strain rate. A case study, in which these results are applied to evaluate the reliability of a packaged surface-micromachined device, is presented.","1941-0158","","10.1109/JMEMS.2002.1007399","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1007399","","Microelectromechanical systems;Micromechanical devices;Electric shock;Microstructure;Guidelines;Failure analysis;Acoustic pulses;Acceleration;Vibrations;Time domain analysis","micromechanical devices;semiconductor device reliability;failure analysis;time-domain analysis","reliability;microelectromechanical systems;shock environments;design;mechanical response;failure criteria;shock loaded microsystems;elastic substrates;finite time duration;relevant time scales;acoustic transit time;time period;applied shock load;rigid bodies;stress-wave-induced damage;time-domain criteria;quasistatic responses;displacement-based criteria;stress-based criteria;50 to 5000 mus","","136","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Single phase power factor correction using a buck boost converter can control the output voltage over a wide range, because it has the ability to step-up and step-down the output voltage. Firstly, this paper compares the mechanisms of the power transmission and the characteristics based on the switching ripple of various converters, in which the Luo converter is added in discussion.

Typically a device such as a head-mounted display (HMD) is used for AR. However, considerable technical problems connected with AR have limited the intraoperative application of HMDs up to now. One of the difficulties in using HMDs is the requirement for a common optical focal plane for both the realworld scene and the computer-generated image, and acceptance of the HMD by the user in a surgical environment. In order to increase the clinical acceptance of AR, we have adapted the Varioscope (Life Optics, Vienna), a miniature, cost-effective head-mounted operating binocular, for AR. In this paper, we present the basic design of the modified HMD, and the method and results of an extensive laboratory study for photogrammetric calibration of the Varioscope's computer displays to a real-world scene. In a series of 16 calibrations with varying zoom factors and object distances, mean calibration error was found to be 1.24 /spl plusmn/ 0.38 pixels or 0.12 /spl plusmn/ 0.05 mm for a 640 /spl times/ 480 display. Maximum error accounted for 3.33 /spl plusmn/ 1.04 pixels or 0.33 /spl plusmn/ 0.12 mm. The location of a position measurement probe of an optical tracking system was transformed to the display with an error of less than 1 mm in the real world in 56% of all cases. For the remaining cases, error was below 2 mm.

A connectionist topology of fuzzy basis functions with their universal approximation capability is served as a fundamental SANFIS architecture that provides an elasticity to be extended to all existing fuzzy models whose consequent could be fuzzy term sets, fuzzy singletons, or functions of linear combination of input variables. Without a priori knowledge of the distribution of the training data set, a novel mapping-constrained agglomerative clustering algorithm is devised to reveal the true cluster configuration in a single pass for an initial SANFIS construction, estimating the location and variance of each cluster. Subsequently, a fast recursive linear/nonlinear least-squares algorithm is performed to further accelerate the learning convergence and improve the system performance. Good generalization capability, fast learning convergence and compact comprehensible knowledge representation summarize the strength of SANFIS. Computer simulations for the Iris, Wisconsin breast cancer, and wine classifications show that SANFIS achieves significant improvements in terms of learning convergence, higher accuracy in recognition, and a parsimonious architecture.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2002.805880","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1097778","","Fuzzy sets;Convergence;Training data;Clustering algorithms;Topology;Elasticity;Input variables;Acceleration;System performance;Knowledge representation","inference mechanisms;fuzzy systems;fuzzy neural nets;pattern clustering;self-adjusting systems;pattern classification","self-adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system;neuro-fuzzy systems;connectionist networks;SANFIS;agglomerative clustering","","199","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It can be easily implemented in a pipelined fashion and has similar performance as the optimal lattice decoding algorithm if high value of K is used. In this paper, we describe a pipelined VLSI architecture for the implementation of the K-best algorithm. The architecture was designed and synthesized using a 0.35 /spl mu/m library.

The ECG signal is first preprocessed, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is then applied to the preprocessed signal. Preprocessing guarantees that the magnitudes of the wavelet coefficients be less than one, and reduces the reconstruction errors near both ends of the compressed signal. The DWT coefficients are divided into three groups, each group is thresholded using a threshold based on a desired energy packing efficiency. A binary significance map is then generated by scanning the wavelet decomposition coefficients and outputting a binary one if the scanned coefficient is significant, and a binary zero if it is-insignificant. Compression is achieved by 1) using a variable length code based on run length encoding to compress the significance map and 2) using direct binary representation for representing the significant coefficients. The ability of the coding algorithm to compress ECG signals is investigated, the results were obtained by compressing and decompressing the test signals.

For the multiple-users scenario, we formulate the problem of real-time video multicast as an optimization of a maximum regret cost function across the multicast user space. The proposed solution efficiently combines progressive source coding with FEC coding.

We consider essentially the same physical model of a wireless network under a different traffic pattern, namely the relay traffic pattern, but we allow for arbitrarily complex network coding. In our model, there is only one active source/destination pair, while all other nodes assist this transmission. We show code constructions leading to achievable rates and derive upper bounds from the max-flow min-cut theorem. It is shown that lower and upper bounds meet asymptotically as the number of nodes in the network goes to infinity, thus proving that the capacity of the wireless network with n nodes under the relay traffic pattern behaves like log n bits per second. This demonstrates also that network coding is essential: under the point-to-point coding assumption considered by Gupta et al., the achievable rate is constant, independent of the number of nodes. Moreover, the result of this paper has implications' and extensions to fading channels and to sensor networks.","0743-166X","0-7803-7476-2","10.1109/INFCOM.2002.1019409","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019409","","Wireless networks;Relays;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Upper bound;Information theory;Broadcasting;Complex networks;H infinity control;Network coding","radio networks;channel coding;channel capacity;encoding;telecommunication traffic;fading channels;Gaussian channels","wireless network capacity;point-to-point coding;multi-access codes;broadcast codes;physical model;relay traffic pattern;active source/destination;network nodes;code constructions;achievable rates;upper bounds;max-flow min-cut theorem;lower bounds;network coding;sensor networks;fading channels;Gaussian relay network;wireless Gaussian relay channel","","247","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These measures are calculated by comparing the positions of the alternatives between the individual solutions and collective solution. In such a way, the consensus situation is evaluated in each moment in a more realistic way. With these measures, we design a consensus support system that is able to substitute the actions of the moderator. In this system, the consensus measure is used to guide the consensus process until the final solution is achieved while the proximity measure is used to guide the discussion phases of the consensus process. The consensus support system has a feedback mechanism to guide the discussion phases based on the proximity measure. This feedback mechanism is based on simple and easy rules to help experts change their opinions in order to obtain a degree of consensus as high as possible. The main improvement of this consensus model is that it supports consensus process automatically, without moderator, and, in such a way, the possible subjectivity that the moderator can introduce in the consensus process is avoided.","1558-2426","","10.1109/TSMCA.2002.802821","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1046070","","Decision making;Phase measurement;Feedback;Position measurement;Computer science;Artificial intelligence;Coordinate measuring machines","decision theory;fuzzy logic","consensus model;multiperson decision making;preference structures;measure of proximity;consensus support system;proximity measure;feedback mechanism;fuzzy preference relations;utility functions","","434","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is done by the feedforward loop, which generates an error signal by comparing the instantaneous array voltage and reference voltage. The reference voltage for the feedforward loop, corresponding to the MP point, is obtained by an off-line trained neural network. Experimental data is used for off-line training of the neural network, which employs back-propagation algorithm.

In this contribution, we describe a probabilistic approach that is able to compensate for imprecisely localized, partially occluded, and expression-variant faces even when only one single training sample per class is available to the system. To solve the localization problem, we find the subspace (within the feature space, e.g., eigenspace) that represents this error for each of the training images. To resolve the occlusion problem, each face is divided into k local regions which are analyzed in isolation. In contrast with other approaches where a simple voting space is used, we present a probabilistic method that analyzes how ""good"" a local match is. To make the recognition system less sensitive to the differences between the facial expression displayed on the training and the testing images, we weight the results obtained on each local area on the basis of how much of this local area is affected by the expression displayed on the current test image.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2002.1008382","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1008382","","Face recognition;Principal component analysis;Image recognition;System testing;Pattern recognition;Lighting;Voting;Learning systems;Displays","face recognition;visual databases;principal component analysis;computer vision;hidden feature removal","face recognition;large representative data sets;learning from undersampled distributions;principal component analysis;probabilistic approach;imprecisely localized faces;partially occluded faces;image database;image warping;expression-variant faces;voting space","","567","","74","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

So far, the research in Internet security primarily focused on. securing the information rather than securing the infrastructure itself. Given the prevailing threat situation, there is a compelling need to develop architectures, algorithms, and protocols to realize a dependable Internet infrastructure. In order to achieve this goal, the first and foremost step is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the security threats and existing solutions. This article attempts to fulfill this important step by providing a taxonomy of security attacks, which are classified into four main categories: DNS hacking, routing table poisoning, packet mistreatment, and denial-of-service attacks. The article discusses the existing solutions for each of these categories, and also outlines a methodology for developing secure protocols.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.2002.1081761","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1081761","","Internet;Taxonomy;Computer crime;Costs;Information security;Protocols;Routing;IP networks;Guidelines;Research initiatives","Internet;telecommunication security;protocols;computer crime","Internet infrastructure security;cyber terrorism;threat situation;dependable infrastructure;DNS hacking;routing table poisoning;packet mistreatment;denial-of-service attacks;secure protocols","","71","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Starting from the raw image data a sequence of image processing steps has to be carried out until a three-dimensional representation of the relevant anatomic and pathologic structures is generated. Based on computed tomography (CT) scans, the following steps are performed. 1) The volume data is preprocessed and the vessels are segmented. 2) The skeleton of the vessels is determined and transformed into a graph enabling a geometrical and structural shape analysis. Using this information the different intrahepatic vessel systems are identified automatically. 3) Based on the structural analysis of the branches of the portal vein, their vascular territories are approximated with different methods. These methods are compared and validated anatomically by means of corrosion casts of human livers. 4) Vessels are visualized with graphics primitives fitted to the skeleton to provide smooth visualizations without aliasing artifacts.

Eng., California Univ., Santa Cruz, CA, USA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","","2002","24","1","75","89","Decomposing video frames into coherent 2D motion layers is a powerful method for representing videos. Such a representation provides an intermediate description that enables applications such as object tracking, video summarization and visualization, video insertion, and sprite-based video compression. Previous work on motion layer analysis has largely concentrated on two-frame or multi-frame batch formulations. The temporal coherency of motion layers and the domain constraints on shapes have not been exploited. This paper introduces a complete dynamic motion layer representation in which spatial and temporal constraints on shape, motion and layer appearance are modeled and estimated in a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) framework using the generalized expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. In order to limit the computational complexity of tracking arbitrarily shaped layer ownership, we propose a shape prior that parameterizes the representation of shape and prevents motion layers from evolving into arbitrary shapes. In this work, a Gaussian shape prior is chosen to specifically develop a near-real-time tracker for vehicle tracking in aerial videos. However, the general idea of using a parametric shape representation as part of the state of a tracker is a powerful one that can be extended to other domains as well. Based on the dynamic layer representation, an iterative algorithm is developed for continuous object tracking over time. The proposed method has been successfully applied in an airborne vehicle tracking system. Its performance is compared with that of a correlation-based tracker and a motion change-based tracker to demonstrate the advantages of the new method. Examples of tracking when the backgrounds are cluttered and the vehicles undergo various rigid motions and complex interactions such as passing, turning, and stop-and-go demonstrate the strength of the complete dynamic layer representation.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.982885","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=982885","","Bayesian methods;Shape;Video compression;Vehicle dynamics;Tracking;Vehicles;Visualization;Motion analysis;Motion estimation;Maximum a posteriori estimation","tracking;Bayes methods;video signal processing;motion estimation;surveillance;real-time systems;maximum likelihood estimation;computational complexity;image representation;optimisation;vehicles;iterative methods;active vision","continuous object tracking;Bayesian estimation;dynamic layer representations;video frame decomposition;coherent 2D motion layers;video representation;intermediate description;video summarization;video visualization;video insertion;sprite-based video compression;motion layer analysis;multi-frame batch formulations;temporal coherency;shape domain constraints;spatial constraints;temporal constraints;layer appearance;maximum a-posteriori estimation;generalized expectation-maximization algorithm;computational complexity;arbitrarily shaped layer ownership;Gaussian shape prior;parameterization;near-real-time tracker;aerial videos;parametric shape representation;iterative algorithm;airborne vehicle tracking system;performance;correlation-based tracker;motion change-based tracker;cluttered backgrounds;rigid motions;complex interactions;vehicle passing;vehicle turning;vehicle stop-and-go;aerial video surveillance","","187","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike the fixed-point fast Fourier transform (FxpFFT), the new transform has the properties that it is an integer-to-integer mapping, is power adaptable and is reversible. The lifting scheme is used to approximate complex multiplications appearing in the FFT lattice structures where the dynamic range of the lifting coefficients can be controlled by proper choices of lifting factorizations. Split-radix FFT is used to illustrate the approach for the case of 2/sup N/-point FFT, in which case, an upper bound of the minimal dynamic range of the internal nodes, which is required by the reversibility of the transform, is presented and confirmed by a simulation. The transform can be implemented by using only bit shifts and additions but no multiplication. A method for minimizing the number of additions required is presented. While preserving the reversibility, the IntFFT is shown experimentally to yield the same accuracy as the FxpFFT when their coefficients are quantized to a certain number of bits. Complexity of the IntFFT is shown to be much lower than that of the FxpFFT in terms of the numbers of additions and shifts. Finally, they are applied to noise reduction applications, where the IntFFT provides significantly improvement over the FxpFFT at low power and maintains similar results at high power.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.984749","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=984749","","Fast Fourier transforms;Discrete Fourier transforms;Dynamic range;Noise reduction;Fourier transforms;Lattices;Upper bound;Digital signal processing;Convolution","fast Fourier transforms;quantisation (signal);noise;computational complexity;fixed point arithmetic","integer fast Fourier transform;fixed-point fast Fourier transform;discrete Fourier transform;DFT;upper bound;reversible. transform;integer-to-integer mapping;lifting scheme;complex multiplications approximation;split-radix FFT;FFT lattice structures;coefficient quantization;noise reduction","","100","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Comprehensive design of a three-dimensional (3-D) active appearance model (AAM) is reported for the first time as an involved extension of the AAM framework introduced by Cootes et al. The model's behavior is learned from manually traced segmentation examples during an automated training stage. Information about shape and image appearance of the cardiac structures is contained in a single model. This ensures a spatially and/or temporally consistent segmentation of three-dimensional cardiac images. The clinical potential of the 3-D AAM is demonstrated in short-axis cardiac MR images and four-chamber echocardiographic sequences. The method's performance was assessed by comparison with manually identified independent standards in 56 clinical MR and 64 clinical echo image sequences. The AAM method showed good agreement with the independent standard using quantitative indexes of border positioning errors, endo- and epicardial volumes, and left ventricular mass. In MR, the endocardial volumes, epicardial volumes, and left ventricular wall mass correlation coefficients between manual and AAM were R/sup 2/=0.94,0.97,0.82, respectively. For echocardiographic analysis, the area correlation was R/sup 2/=0.79.

A new class of single state models is defined in which presliding is elastoplastic: under loading, frictional displacement is first purely elastic and then transitions to plastic. The new model class is demonstrated to substantially reduce drift while preserving the favorable properties of existing models (e.g., dissipativity) and to provide a comparable match to experimental data.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2002.1000274","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1000274","","Friction;Hysteresis;Plastics;Predictive models;Stability analysis;Sliding mode control;Displacement control;Velocity control;Mechanical systems;Servomechanisms","elastoplasticity;sliding friction;controllers;control system synthesis","single state elastoplastic friction models;small displacements;presliding displacement;compensators","","295","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper we report on a fundamental relationship existing between the dielectric breakdown E/sub bd/ and dielectric constant k. An approximate E/sub bd/ /spl sim/ (k )/sup -1/2/ relation is found and seems to be universal, i.e., the relation holds over nearly two decades of dielectric constant. A physics-based model has been developed to understand this critically important relationship. The good fit of the physical model (with no adjustable parameters) to the experimental data suggests that the local electric field (Lorentz-relation/Mossotti-field) in these high-k materials plays a very important role in the observed E/sub bd/ /spl sim/ (k)/sup -1/2/ behavior.

In a sense, a data management model supported by NetDB2 provides an effective mechanism for organizations to purchase data management as a service, thereby freeing them to concentrate on their core businesses. Among the primary challenges introduced by ""database as a service"" are the additional overhead of remote access to data, an infrastructure to guarantee data privacy, and user interface design for such a service.

In this work, using BSIM3 models, the performance and energy dissipation of 0.18-/spl mu/m CMOS circuits for the range of V/sub dd/ = 0.1-0.6V and V/sub th/ = 0-0.6V are analyzed to show that subthreshold CMOS circuits can be used in low performance applications.

The robot has an articulated leg and uses two hydraulic actuators as muscles and a tensile spring as a tendon. The spring being attached like the gastrocnemius or plantaris enables the robot to produce sufficient propulsion force by virtue of the ""energy transfer"" from the knee, even if there is no actuator at the ankle joint. Using an empirical controller based on the characteristic dynamics of the model, the robot has succeeded in planar one-legged hopping.

For typical monolithic-microwave integrated-circuit chip sizes, these unwanted resonance frequencies lie within the microwave and millimeter-wave frequency region. Due to this feedback mechanism, today's coplanar millimeter-wave amplifiers operating up to 250 GHz require special packaging techniques for stable operation. The use of vias is one method of suppressing parallel-plate modes. The effect of via-holes within a ground plane and the effect of an open or a shorted ground-plane periphery on the parallel-plate modes of CBCPWs were investigated in depth up to 200 GHz for quartz and GaAs substrates. It is shown that the placement of the vias within the coplanar-waveguide structure is crucial for the suppression of parallel-plate modes. If properly placed, vias are an effective means to suppress these unwanted modes over a chosen frequency range.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2002.1006419","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1006419","","Resonance;Millimeter wave circuits;Millimeter wave technology;Coplanar waveguides;Planar waveguides;Patch antennas;Resonant frequency;Feedback;Operational amplifiers;Packaging","coplanar waveguide components;MMIC;MIMIC;integrated circuit packaging;quartz;gallium arsenide;circuit stability;millimetre wave amplifiers","conductor-backed coplanar circuits;ground planes;conductor-backed coplanar waveguides;conductor-backed CPWs;parallel-plate modes suppression;monolithic microwave IC;MM-wave integrated circuit;coplanar millimeter-wave amplifiers;packaging techniques;stable operation;vias;ground plane via holes;open ground-plane periphery;shorted ground-plane periphery;quartz substrate;GaAs substrate;resonances;feedback mechanism;250 GHz;SiO/sub 2/;GaAs","","88","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The electrical model of the induction machine presents the basic idea based on an observer structure, which is composed of a voltage model and a current model. However, the former has the defects of sensitivity to machine parameters in the low-speed range, and the latter also has defects that are sensitive to the machine parameters in wide-speed range. In spite of these shortcomings, the closed-loop flux observer based on two models has been a prevalent estimation method for direct field-oriented control. In this paper, a generalized analysis method called the ""observer characteristic function method"" is proposed to analyze all kinds of the linear flux observers in an unified form. By the observer characteristic function being utilized, the estimated rotor-flux error involved in the classical methods can be easily clarified. Moreover, the novel rotor-flux observer based on this analysis is also presented. The proposed flux observer is robust to the offset voltage and to parameter variation. The effectiveness of the novel flux observer has been verified by the numerical analysis and experimental results.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2002.802994","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1035187","","Stators;Inductance;Induction machines;Rotors;Numerical analysis;Frequency;Force measurement;Voltage measurement;Low voltage;Induction motor drives","induction motor drives;machine vector control;observers;rotors;magnetic flux;parameter estimation;closed loop systems","rotor flux observer;field-oriented induction motor drives;complex vector space;observer characteristic function;voltage model;current;closed-loop flux observer;estimation method;direct field-oriented control;linear flux observers;flux observer;offset voltage;numerical analysis","","58","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This fault results in rotational electromagnetic asymmetry on both the stator and rotor, making it difficult to analyze using classical dq-transformation techniques. This paper presents a new dq synchronous-frame machine model that is capable of handling this highly asymmetrical fault condition, including the effects of q axis magnetic saturation. Fault responses with two alternative post-fault control strategies are investigated: (1) opening all of the inverter switches so that the machine behaves as an uncontrolled generator (UCG), with the two unfaulted phases connected to the inverter DC link via the antiparallel diodes; and (2) shorting the two remaining unfaulted phases together using the inverter switches. Results of this investigation show that the fault response is generally more benign using the UCG control strategy, with significantly lower phase currents and pulsating torque than corresponding values delivered using the phase-shorting strategy.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2002.802180","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1035152","","Synchronous machines;Circuit faults;Inverters;Switches;Steady-state;Permanent magnets;Stators;Rotors;Electromagnetic analysis;Magnetic analysis","synchronous motor drives;permanent magnet motors;electrical faults;torque;stators;rotors;invertors;variable speed drives;machine control","interior permanent magnet synchronous motor drive;interior PMSM drive;steady-state response;dynamic response;single-phase open-circuit fault;rotational electromagnetic asymmetry;stator;rotor;classical dq-transformation techniques;dq synchronous-frame machine model;q axis magnetic saturation;fault responses;post-fault control strategies;inverter switches;uncontrolled generator;unfaulted phases shorting;inverter DC link;antiparallel diodes;phase currents;pulsating torque;inverter shutdown;open circuit fault;variable speed drive","","82","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents a comprehensive statistical reliability model with an excellent fit to data collected on several technology generations in multi-year bakes. The leakage current is exponential in voltage and has a low but nonzero activation energy. The statistical variation is Weibull. The fraction of cells affected scales as a power law in cycle count, with significant dependence on the vertical and horizontal electric fields in cycling but little on the cycling temperature. A single model equation comprehends all of these effects. The mechanism anneals or recovers at moderate temperatures in a manner sensitive to processing details, which are discussed. A new technique is introduced to deduce the number of traps involved in the trap-assisted-tunneling (percolation) paths by correlating the effect to oxide trap density using cycling-induced erase-time push-out. The results suggest that the percolation paths consist of only a small number of traps, most likely two. Contrary to predictions that this mechanism is a hard barrier to scaling of flash memory, we show that it has been possible to reduce the effect by several orders of magnitude over the course of several generations of technology scaling.","","0-7803-7352-9","10.1109/RELPHY.2002.996604","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=996604","","Electron traps;Leakage current;Nonvolatile memory;MOS capacitors;Tunneling;Flash memory;Temperature dependence;Temperature sensors;Dielectrics;Stress","flash memories;integrated memory circuits;leakage currents;integrated circuit reliability;Weibull distribution;integrated circuit modelling;statistical analysis;electric fields;hole traps;electron traps;electronic density of states;integrated circuit testing;annealing","reliability model;post-cycling charge retention;flash memories;stress-induced leakage;memory cells;program/erase cycling;statistical reliability model;multi-year bakes;memory technology generations;leakage current;activation energy;Weibull statistical variation;power law scaling;vertical electric fields;horizontal electric fields;cycling temperature;model equation;anneal temperatures;mechanism recovery temperatures;trap-assisted-tunneling paths;cycling-induced erase-time push-out;oxide trap density;percolation paths;flash memory scaling;technology scaling","","61","","51","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We provide further support for the hypothesis that as the pulse duration is decreased, there is a lower incidence of electric field interactions at the plasma membrane and a higher incidence of interactions with intracellular structures. The nsPEF effects are pulse duration/electric field intensity-dependent and energy density- or temperature-independent. We also show that nsPEF induces programmed cell. death (apoptosis) in cultured cells as indicated by cell shrinkage, Annexin-V-FITC binding to phosphatidylserine on intact cells, and caspase activation. Mouse fibrosarcoma tumors exposed to nsPEF exhibit fragmented DNA and reduced tumor growth in a mouse model.

The nonlinear diffusion coefficient is locally adjusted according to image features such as edges, textures, and moments. As such, it can switch the diffusion process from a forward to a backward (inverse) mode according to a given set of criteria. This results in a forward-and-backward (FAB) adaptive diffusion process that enhances features while locally denoising smoother segments of the signal or image. The proposed method, using the FAB process, is applied in a super-resolution scheme. The FAB method is further generalized for color processing via the Beltrami flow, by adaptively modifying the structure tensor that controls the nonlinear diffusion process. The proposed structure tensor is neither positive definite nor negative, and switches between these states according to image features. This results in a forward-and-backward diffusion flow where different regions of the image are either forward or backward diffused according to the local geometry within a neighborhood.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2002.800883","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1021076","","Diffusion processes;Image enhancement;Noise reduction;Switches;Signal processing;Tensile stress;Image segmentation;Signal resolution;Color;Geometry","adaptive signal processing;image colour analysis;image enhancement;image resolution","forward-and-backward diffusion processes;adaptive image enhancement;adaptive image denoising;signal enhancement;nonlinear diffusion coefficient;image features;backward mode;inverse mode;super-resolution scheme;color processing;Beltrami flow;structure tensor;nonlinear diffusion process;local geometry","","225","","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

SPICE simulations of the ring oscillator with the affected FET represented by an equivalent circuit confirm the measured influence of the breakdown on the circuit's frequency, the stand-by and the operating currents. It is concluded that if maintaining a digital circuit's logical functionality is the sufficient reliability criterion, a nonzero probability exists that the circuit will remain functional beyond the first gate oxide breakdown.

All the above quantities are analytically calculated from the speckled image, the variance and autocorrelation of the fading variable, and the wavelet filters only, without resorting to any model to describe the underlying backscatter. On the test image Lena corrupted by synthetic speckle, the proposed method outperforms Kuan's local linear MMSE filtering by almost 3-dB signal-to-noise ratio. When true synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are concerned, empirical criteria based on distributions of multiscale local coefficient of variation, calculated in the undecimated wavelet domain, are introduced to mitigate the rescaling of coefficients in highly heterogeneous areas where the speckle does not obey a fully developed model, to avoid blurring strong textures and point targets. Experiments carried out on widespread test SAR images and on a speckled mosaic image, comprising synthetic shapes, textures, and details from optical images, demonstrate that the visual quality of the results is excellent in terms of both background smoothing and preservation of edge sharpness, textures, and point targets.

These wind farms are connected to high voltage transmission grids and thus directly influence the dynamic behavior of the electrical power system. To facilitate the investigation of the impact of a wind farm on the dynamics of the power system to which it is connected, an adequate model is required. In order to avoid the necessity of developing a detailed model of a wind farm with tens or hundreds of wind turbines and their interconnections, aggregated wind farm models are needed.

In practice, static and dynamic eccentricities happen to exist together. With this point in mind, an analytical approach to evaluate the performance of a three-phase induction motor under mixed eccentric conditions is presented in this paper. A clear and step-by-step theoretical analysis, explaining completely the presence of certain harmonics in the line-current spectrum in the presence of eccentricity, is discussed. More importantly, it is shown for the first time that a link exists between the low- and high-frequency elements of these harmonics. It is also shown that these high-frequency components are not very strong in all types of machine. These results will be useful in generating rules and laws to formulate online tools for machine condition monitoring. Finite-element results to substantiate the inductance values used in the simulation are also included. The analysis is validated by the line-current spectrum of the eccentric machine obtained through simulation using the modified winding-function approach (MWFA) and experimentation.","1558-0059","","10.1109/TEC.2002.801995","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1033967","","Performance analysis;Induction motors;Air gaps;Stators;Rotors;Equations;Frequency;Manufacturing;Harmonic analysis;Condition monitoring","induction motors;electrical faults;fault diagnosis;machine theory;finite element analysis;harmonic analysis","three-phase induction motor;performance analysis;mixed eccentricity condition;induction motor faults;static eccentricities;dynamic eccentricities;low-frequency components;high-frequency components;machine-condition monitoring;finite-element analysis;modified winding-function approach;line-current spectrum","","164","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The additional degree of freedom introduced in the converter in the form of a freewheeling interval has been exploited through an easy control technique to achieve this elimination. The absence of the RHP zero allows the control scheme to achieve larger bandwidth under closed-loop conditions, resulting in fast response. Analytical, simulation and experimental results of the tri-state boost converter have been presented and compared with those of the classical boost converter both under open-loop and under closed-loop operating conditions. The results clearly demonstrate the superior dynamic performance of the proposed converter.

In voltage-model-based stator flux estimation, an LP filter is normally used instead of a pure integrator to avoid integration drift problem due to DC offset, noise, or measurement error present in the back electromotive force. In steady-state condition, the LP filter estimator will degrade the performance and efficiency of the direct torque control (DTC) drive system since it introduced magnitude and phase errors, thus resulting in an incorrect voltage vector selection. The stator flux steady-state error between the LP filter and a pure integrator estimator technique is derived and its effect on the steady-state DTC drive performance is analyzed. A simple method is proposed to compensate for this error which results in a significant improvement in the steady-state drive performance.

Whether the promise of BWA will materialize depends on its appeal to telecom operators from the perspective of deployment economics, where the critical factor is the ease of installation of broadband wireless subscriber units. This ultimately leads to nonprofessional installation of integrated all-indoor BWSUs. Consequently the physical layer (PHY) has to mitigate the very tough impairments that characterize these non-line-of-sight environments.

FMT modulation mitigates interference due to echo and near-end crosstalk signals, and increases the system throughput and reach. Signal equalization in an FMT receiver is accomplished in the form of per-subchannel symbol-spaced or fractionally spaced linear or decision-feedback equalization. The problem of channel coding for this type of modulation is also addressed, and an approach that allows combined removal of intersymbol-interference via precoding and trellis coding is described.

So, relationships between the maximum power point and circuit variables such as open circuit voltage and short circuit current were examined under various conditions appearing in the PV power generation system.

The trapping-induced flatband shift in HfO/sub 2/ with Al gates increases monotonically with injection fluence for p-type Si substrates, while it shows a turnaround phenomenon for n-type Si substrates due to the shift of the charge centroid. The trapping-induced flatband shift is nearly independent of stress voltage for p-type substrates, while it increases dramatically with stress voltage for n-type Si substrates due to two competing mechanisms. The trap density can be reduced by increasing the annealing temperature from 500/spl deg/C to 600/spl deg/C.

This approach, unlike classical ones, is based on the formulation of the unsupervised change-detection problem in terms of the Bayesian decision theory. In this context, an adaptive semiparametric technique for the unsupervised estimation of the statistical terms associated with the gray levels of changed and unchanged pixels in a difference image is presented. Such a technique exploits the effectivenesses of two theoretically well-founded estimation procedures: the reduced Parzen estimate (RPE) procedure and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Then, thanks to the resulting estimates and to a Markov random field (MRF) approach used to model the spatial-contextual information contained in the multitemporal images considered, a change detection map is generated. The adaptive semiparametric nature of the proposed technique allows its application to different kinds of remote-sensing images. Experimental results, obtained on two sets of multitemporal remote-sensing images acquired by two different sensors, confirm the validity of the proposed approach.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2002.999678","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=999678","","Remote sensing;Image sensors;Estimation theory;Change detection algorithms;Image analysis;Bayesian methods;Decision theory;Pixel;Markov random fields;Expectation-maximization algorithms","remote sensing;image processing;Bayes methods;decision theory;unsupervised learning;statistical analysis;optimisation;Markov processes;random processes;feature extraction;adaptive signal processing;parameter estimation","adaptive semiparametric approach;unsupervised change detection;multitemporal remote-sensing images;automatic approach;unsupervised identification;unsupervised change-detection;Bayesian decision theory;gray levels;pixels;difference image;statistical terms;unsupervised estimation;reduced Parzen estimate;expectation-maximization algorithm;EM algorithm;Markov random field;spatial-contextual information;change detection map","","240","","47","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The silicon substrate has a pronounced effect on the quality factor and mutual resistive coupling factor of the primary and secondary coils, thereby degrading the maximum available gain of the transformer. A highly structured patterned ground shield is shown to improve the maximum available gain of a transformer at high frequencies, while at low frequencies, it has little effect on the maximum available gain and even degrades the quality factors of the transformer coils.

Eng., Cornell Univ., Ithaca, NY, USA","IEEE Transactions on Communications","","2002","50","6","975","985","In ad hoc networks, the hidden- and the exposed-terminal problems can severely reduce the network capacity on the MAC layer. To address these problems, the ready-to-send and clear-to-send (RTS/CTS) dialogue has been proposed in the literature. However, MAC schemes using only the RTS/CTS dialogue cannot completely solve the hidden and the exposed terminal problems, as pure ""packet sensing"" MAC schemes are not safe even in fully connected networks. We propose a new MAC protocol, termed the dual busy tone multiple access (DBTMA) scheme. The operation of the DBTMA protocol is based on the RTS packet and two narrow-bandwidth, out-of-band busy tones. With the use of the RTS packet and the receive busy tone, which is set up by the receiver, our scheme completely solves the hidden- and the exposed-terminal problems. The busy tone, which is set up by the transmitter, provides protection for the RTS packets, increasing the probability of successful RTS reception and, consequently, increasing the throughput. This paper outlines the operation rules of the DBTMA scheme and analyzes its performance. Simulation results are also provided to support the analytical results. It is concluded that the DBTMA protocol is superior to other schemes that rely on the RTS/CTS dialogue on a single channel or to those that rely on a single busy tone. As a point of reference, the DBTMA scheme out-performs FAMA-NCS by 20-40% in our simulations using the network topologies borrowed from the FAMA-NCS paper. In an ad hoc network with a large coverage area, DBTMA achieves performance gain of 140% over FAMA-NCS and performance gain of 20% over RI-BTMA.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2002.1010617","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1010617","","Access control;Ad hoc networks;Access protocols;Performance gain;Media Access Protocol;Transmitters;Protection;Throughput;Performance analysis;Analytical models","land mobile radio;packet radio networks;access protocols;network topology","dual busy tone multiple access;DBTMA;multiple access control;ad hoc networks;network capacity;MAC layer;ready-to-send dialogue;clear-to-send dialogue;RTS/CTS dialogue;hidden terminal problems;exposed terminal problems;packet sensing MAC schemes;MAC protocol;DBTMA protocol;RTS packet;narrow-bandwidth tones;out-of-band busy tones;throughput;simulation results;FAMA-NCS;network topologies;performance evaluation","","365","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While challenging even in the best of circumstances, this problem poses unique difficulties when the dimensions of the interferometric input data exceed the limits of one's computational capabilities. In order to deal with such cases, we propose a technique for applying the statistical-cost, network-flow phase-unwrapping algorithm (SNAPHU) of Chen and Zebker (2001) to large datasets. Specifically, we introduce a methodology whereby a large interferogram is partitioned into a set of several smaller tiles that are unwrapped individually and then divided further into independent, irregularly shaped reliable regions. These regions are subsequently assembled into a full unwrapped solution, with the phase offsets between regions computed in a secondary optimization problem whose objective is to maximize the a posteriori probability of the final solution. As this secondary problem assumes the same statistical models as employed in the initial tile-unwrapping stage, the technique results in a solution that approximates the solution that would have been obtained had the full-size interferogram been unwrapped as a single piece. The secondary problem is framed in terms of network-flow ideas, allowing the use of an existing nonlinear solver. Applying the algorithm to a large topographic interferogram acquired over central Alaska, we find that the technique is less prone to unwrapping artifacts than more simple tiling approaches.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2002.802453","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1036000","","Synthetic aperture radar interferometry;Probability;Phase estimation;Geophysics computing;Partitioning algorithms;Two dimensional displays;Data analysis;Algorithm design and analysis","synthetic aperture radar;radiowave interferometry;remote sensing by radar;optimisation;radar imaging;geophysical signal processing;image segmentation;statistical analysis","phase unwrapping;large SAR interferograms;statistical segmentation;generalized network models;interferometric synthetic aperture radar data;InSAR data;interferometric input data;statistical-cost network-flow phase-unwrapping algorithm;SNAPHU;tiles;secondary optimization problem;a posteriori probability;statistical models;tile-unwrapping stage;full-size interferograrn;network-flow;nonlinear solver;topographic interferogram;central Alaska","","241","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Usage of sparse arithmetic permits the computer code to handle large systems.

These models show considerable promise as a basis for segmenting and interpreting images. One of the drawbacks of the approach is, however, the need to establish a set of dense correspondences between all members of a set of training shapes. Often this is achieved by locating a set of ""landmarks"" manually on each training image, which is time consuming and subjective in two dimensions and almost impossible in three dimensions. We describe how shape models can be built automatically by posing the correspondence problem as one of finding the parameterization for each shape in the training set. We select the set of parameterizations that build the ""best"" model. We define ""best"" as that which minimizes the description length of the training set, arguing that this leads to models with good compactness, specificity and generalization ability. We show how a set of shape parameterizations can be represented and manipulated in order to build a minimum description length model. Results are given for several different training sets of two-dimensional boundaries, showing that the proposed method constructs better models than other approaches including manual landmarking-the current gold standard. We also show that the method can be extended straightforwardly to three dimensions.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2002.1009388","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1009388","","Shape;Image segmentation;Biomedical imaging;Biomedical engineering;Gold;Statistical analysis;Interpolation;Humans","minimisation;statistical analysis;image segmentation;medical image processing;modelling","minimum description length approach;statistical shape modeling;automatic landmarking;active shape models;image interpretation;medical diagnostic imaging;correspondence problem;minimum description length;point distribution models;generalization ability;shape parameterizations;two-dimensional boundaries","Algorithms;Animals;Artificial Intelligence;Brain;Brain Ischemia;Cartilage, Articular;Hand;Heart Ventricles;Hip;Hip;Hip Prosthesis;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Theory;Kidney;Knee;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Models, Statistical;Multivariate Analysis;Normal Distribution;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Quality Control;Rats;Rats, Inbred F344;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Sensitivity and Specificity;Stochastic Processes","324","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"A power-efficient wide-range phase-locked loop","O. T. -. Chen; R. R. -. Sheen","Dept. of Electr. Eng., Nat. Chung Cheng Univ., Chia-Yi, Taiwan; NA","IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","","2002","37","1","51","62","This work presents a phase-locked loop for clock generation that consists of a phase/frequency detector, charge pump, loop filter, range-programmable voltage-controlled ring oscillator, and programmable divider. The phase/frequency detector and charge pump are designed to reduce the dead zone and charge sharing for enhancing the locking performance, respectively. In the design of the range-programmable voltage-controlled oscillator, the original inverter ring of a delay line is divided into several smaller ones, and then they are recombined in parallel to each other. Programming the number of paralleled inverter rings allows us to generate the wide-range clock frequencies. This design shuts off some inverters that are not in use to reduce power consumption. To allow the phase-locked loop to shut off inverters, the feasibility of using controllable inverters by the output-switch and power-switch schemes is explored. Theoretical analyses indicate that power consumption of the voltage-controlled oscillator depends on transistors' sizes rather than operating frequencies. By applying the TSMC 0.35-/spl mu/m CMOS technology, the proposed phase-locked loop that uses the power-switch scheme can yield clock signals ranging from 103 MHz to 1.02 GHz at a supply voltage of 1.8 V. Moreover, power dissipation that is proportional to the number of paralleled inverter rings is measured with 1.32 to 4.59 mW. The phase-locked loop proposed herein can be used in various digital systems, providing power-efficient and wide-range clock signals for task-oriented computations.","1558-173X","","10.1109/4.974545","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=974545","","Phase locked loops;Inverters;Clocks;Voltage-controlled oscillators;Phase detection;Phase frequency detector;Charge pumps;Energy consumption;CMOS technology;Frequency conversion","CMOS integrated circuits;phase locked loops;low-power electronics;clocks;voltage-controlled oscillators;programmable circuits","power efficiency;phase-locked loop;phase/frequency detector;charge pump;loop filter;range-programmable voltage-controlled ring oscillator;programmable divider;dead zone;charge sharing;inverter;delay line;clock generation;output-switch;power-switch;power consumption;CMOS technology;digital system;0.35 micron;103 MHz to 1.02 GHz;1.8 V;1.32 to 4.59 mW","","43","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A critical bandwidth value is discovered, beyond which pushing the bandwidth can no longer reduce the output voltage spike during the transient. This critical bandwidth is determined by the characteristics of the output filter bulk capacitor. In order to reduce the size and improve the transient response of the VRM, better capacitors with low equivalent series resistance (ESR) show that high control bandwidth and high switching frequency are the trends for new designs.

In this paper, instead of focusing on a particular PA model and building a corresponding predistorter, we focus directly on the predistorter structure.

We show that SP modes can significantly detract from device efficiency, particularly those based on small molecules.

Although haze is distributed in the lower frequency layer, this layer may also contain a component of land cover that is spatially and temporally relatively stable. A haze-free reference image of the same area is used to characterize land cover. The component of the characterized land cover is then subtracted with wavelet analysis. The residual wavelet coefficients are used to construct a spatially varying mask for subsequent haze detection and removal.

By observing just a few frames, we can identify the activity that takes place in a video sequence. The basic idea of our method is that activities can be positively identified from a sparsely sampled sequence of a few body poses acquired from videos. In our approach, an activity is represented by a set of pose and velocity vectors for the major body parts (hands, legs, and torso) and stored in a set of multidimensional hash tables. We develop a theoretical foundation that shows that robust recognition of a sequence of body pose vectors can be achieved by a method of indexing and sequencing and it requires only a few pose vectors (i.e., sampled body poses in video frames). We find that the probability of false alarm drops exponentially with the increased number of sampled body poses. So, matching only a few body poses guarantees high probability for correct recognition. Our approach is parallel, i.e., all possible model activities are examined at one indexing operation. In addition, our method is robust to partial occlusion since each body part is indexed separately. We use a sequence-based voting approach to recognize the activity invariant to the activity speed.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2002.1023805","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1023805","","Humans;Multidimensional systems;Indexing;Robustness;Biological system modeling;Video sequences;Leg;Torso;Legged locomotion;Voting","video signal processing;image recognition;indexing","human activity recognition;multidimensional indexing;view-based recognition;video sequence;sparsely sampled sequence;pose vectors;velocity vectors;hands;legs;torso;multidimensional hash tables;indexing;sequencing;false alarm probability;partial occlusion robustness;sequence-based voting approach","","156","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Gain compression (AM/AM) and amplitude-phase (AM/PM) distortion are the two primary model inputs used to characterize the nonlinearity. The amplifier's AM/AM and AM/PM characteristics are typically measured statically using a vector network analyzer. Since the input is typically a modulated signal, it is desirable to characterize the amplifier dynamically. This paper describes and demonstrates a dynamic AM/AM and AM/PM measurement and modeling technique involving a spectrum analyzer and two-tone input signals. A complete analysis of the measurement technique is presented, along with the data processing needed for the identification of a new three-box model. The test configuration and procedure are presented with special precautions to minimize measurement error. Results for a solid-state amplifier are used to accurately predict intermodulation distortion, while those for a traveling-wave tube amplifier show good agreement with that obtained dynamically using a 16 quadrature-amplitude-modulation signal.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2002.1006421","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1006421","","Distortion measurement;Linearity;Power amplifiers;Nonlinear distortion;Spectral analysis;Measurement techniques;Data processing;Testing;Measurement errors;Solid state circuits","microwave power amplifiers;microwave measurement;amplitude modulation;phase modulation;spectral analysers;measurement errors;intermodulation distortion;travelling wave amplifiers","power-amplifier characterization;two-tone measurement technique;nonlinear model;gain compression;primary model inputs;AM/AM characteristics;AM/PM characteristics;spectrum analyzer;data processing;three-box model;measurement error;intermodulation distortion;traveling-wave tube amplifier;solid-state amplifier;amplitude-phase distortion","","35","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Architectural optimization is not an effective solution infeed-back mode. Loop unrolling is the only architecture that can achieve a slight speedup with significantly increased area. In non-feedback mode, subpipelining can achieve maximum speedup and the best speed/area ratio. Algorithmic optimization exploits algorithmic strength inside each round unit.

In low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and nonstationary environments, conventional approaches to endpoint detection and energy normalization often fail and ASR performances usually degrade dramatically. The purpose of this paper is to address the endpoint problem. For ASR, we propose a real-time approach. It uses an optimal filter plus a three-state transition diagram for endpoint detection. The filter is designed utilizing several criteria to ensure accuracy and robustness. It has almost invariant response at various background noise levels. The detected endpoints are then applied to energy normalization sequentially. Evaluation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the string error rates in low SNR situations. The reduction rates even exceed 50% in several evaluated databases. For SV, we propose a batch-mode approach. It uses the optimal filter plus a two-mixture energy model for endpoint detection. The experiments show that the batch-mode algorithm can detect endpoints as accurately as using HMM forced alignment while the proposed one has much less computational complexity.","1558-2353","","10.1109/TSA.2002.1001979","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1001979","","Automatic speech recognition;Acoustic signal detection;Filters;Signal to noise ratio;Hidden Markov models;Loudspeakers;Degradation;Noise robustness;Background noise;Error analysis","real-time systems;hidden Markov models;speaker recognition;speech recognition;noise;filtering theory;signal detection","robust endpoint detection;energy normalization;real-time speaker recognition;real-time speech recognition;automatic speech recognition;speaker verification;adverse acoustic environments;signal-to-noise ratio;low SNR;nonstationary environments;real-time approach;optimal filter;three-state transition diagram;background noise levels;error rate reduction;databases;batch-mode approach;two-mixture energy model;batch-mode algorithm;HMM forced alignment;computational complexity","","118","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Second, it models the worst-case timing of possible paths on the target hardware, where the characterization of the timing of sophisticated hardware features (e.g., instruction pipelines, caches, parallel execution units) and their interferences are non-trivial. This paper presents a programming paradigm that takes the complexity from WCET analysis. Program code written according to this paradigm only has a single execution path. Writing single-path code makes path analysis and thus WCET analysis trivial. The WCET of the single path is obtained by executing the code (necessarily on that single path) and logging the duration of this execution. To demonstrate that the single-path approach provides a universal solution to the WCET-analysis problem, the paper shows how every, WCET-analyzable piece of code can be translated into single-path code.","1530-1443","0-7695-1576-2","10.1109/WORDS.2002.1000040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1000040","","Writing;Information analysis;Real time systems;Timing;Hardware;Pipelines;Interference;Automatic control;Computer science;Time factors","program diagnostics;real-time systems","worst-case execution-time analysis;path analysis;execution paths;worst-case timing;instruction pipelines;caches;parallel execution units;programming paradigm;WCET analysis;temporally predictable code","","33","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The majority of previous approaches require a complex setup of the hybrid position/force-control architecture, and have not fully addressed the coordination problem when the robots are not kinematically constrained but perform a common task. In this paper, we propose to use a new coordination scheme that is more straightforward and easier to implement and is applicable to a wider area. The basic idea of the new coordination strategy is to use the concept of motion synchronization, since the problem of coordinating multiple manipulators is basically the problem of maintaining certain kinematic relationships amongst robots. The key to the success of the new method is to ensure that each manipulator tracks its desired trajectory while synchronizing its motion with other manipulators' motions, so that differential (or synchronization) position errors amongst manipulators converge to zero. The controller, designed by incorporating the cross-coupling technology into an adaptive-control architecture, successfully guarantees asymptotic convergence to zero of both position tracking and synchronization errors simultaneously. Experiments and simulations on multirobot assembly systems demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.","2374-958X","","10.1109/TRA.2002.802229","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1044363","","Programmable control;Adaptive control;Manipulators;Robot kinematics;Robotic assembly;Multirobot systems;Tracking;Trajectory;Error correction;Assembly systems","adaptive control;synchronisation;manipulators;assembling;force control","adaptive synchronized control;position control architecture;manipulator;cross-coupling technology;position tracking;synchronization errors;multirobot assembly systems;motion synchronization;kinematic relationships;position errors;force control architecture;adaptive-control architecture;asymptotic convergence;multirobot assembly tasks coordination","","149","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While professors of engineering science can increase awareness by stimulating engineering students to build sustainable ideas into their designs, professors of engineering ethics might work to complement this by helping to transform the attitudes, values, and philosophies of the new engineer.

The initiation process is examined in terms of the injection of space charge and its ability to transfer energy to the polymer to create damage. Theoretical models for the processes involved are assessed in terms of the experimental data and an outline for the sequence of events in tree initiation developed. The inter-relationship between tree discharges, tree propagation, and tree shape is discussed. Theoretical models for these processes are evaluated in terms of their ability to reproduce experimental data, especially tree shapes and discharge sequences in time and space. The chaotic nature of the tree propagation mechanism is discussed both through experimental data and the results of a completely deterministic theoretical model.

It aims to identify a set of reference signatures (also known as endmembers) that can be used to model the reflectance spectrum at each pixel of the original image. Thus, the modeling is carried out as a linear combination of a finite number of ground components. Although spectral mixture models have proved to be appropriate for the purpose of large hyperspectral dataset subpixel analysis, few methods are available in the literature for the extraction of appropriate endmembers in spectral unmixing. Most approaches have been designed from a spectroscopic viewpoint and, thus, tend to neglect the existing spatial correlation between pixels. This paper presents a new automated method that performs unsupervised pixel purity determination and endmember extraction from multidimensional datasets; this is achieved by using both spatial and spectral information in a combined manner. The method is based on mathematical morphology, a classic image processing technique that can be applied to the spectral domain while being able to keep its spatial characteristics.

Spatial filters employing multiple, freestanding, FSS screens have been successfully designed by utilizing a domain-decomposed GA. We present a procedure for synthesizing broadband microwave absorbers by using multiple FSS screens buried in a dielectric composite. A binary coded microgenetic algorithm (MGA) is applied to optimize various parameters, viz., the thickness and relative permittivity of each dielectric layer; the FSS screen designs and materials; their x- and y-periodicities; and their placement within the dielectric composite. The result is a multilayer composite that provides maximum absorption of both transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) waves simultaneously for a prescribed range of frequencies and incident angles. This technique automatically places an upper bound on the total thickness of the composite. While a single FSS screen is analyzed using the electric field integral equation (EFIE), multiple FSS screens are analyzed using the scattering matrix technique.","1558-2221","","10.1109/8.999618","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=999618","","Algorithm design and analysis;Frequency selective surfaces;Spatial filters;Magnetic analysis;Genetic algorithms;Design optimization;Permittivity;Composite materials;Dielectric materials;Magnetic materials","frequency selective surfaces;radomes;microwave materials;electromagnetic wave absorption;dielectric materials;genetic algorithms;permittivity;electric field integral equations;electromagnetic wave scattering","broadband microwave absorbers design;multiple frequency selective surface screens;radomes;spatial filters;military applications;commercial applications;FSS screens;EM wave scattering;method of moments;MoM;domain-decomposed GA;dielectric composite;binary coded microgenetic algorithm;parameters optimization;thickness;relative permittivity;dielectric layer;y-periodicity;x-periodicity;multilayer composite;transverse electric waves;transverse magnetic waves;TM waves;TE waves;incident angles;upper bound;electric field integral equation;EFIE;scattering matrix","","100","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The power assist was performed according to the operator's intention by using myoelectricity(EMG) signal as the primary command signal. However, there remains the problem that the operator senses the discomfort while the power assist is performed by EMG-based control. The scope of the present research is to propose the control methods to reduce the discomfort which the operator sense while the EMG-based power assist is performed in walking and standing up respectively; 1) the control method that the integrated motion between HAL-3 and the operator corresponds with the particularity of operator's musculo-skeletal system while in the power assist walking, 2) the predictive control method applying feedforward controller to remove the discomfort while in standing up. As the result, the power assist walking was performed corresponding to the joint kinematics of the normal walking without the assistance. Applying feedforward controller realized the quick response while in standing up power assist.

The bandwidth of the signal used in this experiment is in excess of 1 GHz, which results in a differential path delay resolution of less than a nanosecond, without special processing. Based on the experimental results, a characterization of the propagation channel from a communications theoretic view point is described, and its implications for the design of a UWB radio receiver are presented. Robustness of the UWB signal to multipath fading is quantified through histograms and cumulative distributions. The all RAKE (ARAKE) receiver and maximum-energy-capture selective RAKE (SRAKE) receiver are introduced. The ARAKE receiver serves as the best case (bench mark) for RAKE receiver design and lower bounds the performance degradation caused by multipath. Multipath components of measured waveforms are detected using a maximum-likelihood detector. Energy capture as a function of the number of single-path signal correlators used in UWB SRAKE receiver provides a complexity versus performance tradeoff. Bit-error-probability performance of a UWB SRAKE receiver, based on measured channels, is given as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio and the number of correlators implemented in the receiver.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2002.805031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1097827","","Bandwidth;RAKE receivers;Fading;Correlators;Laboratories;Signal processing;Delay;Signal resolution;Robustness;Histograms","radiowave propagation;radio networks;broadband networks;indoor radio;radio receivers;correlators;multipath channels;fading channels","ultra-wide bandwidth wireless indoor channels;communication theory;ultra-wide bandwidth signal propagation;laboratory/office building;signal bandwidth;differential path delay resolution;UWB radio receiver;UWB signal;multipath fading;histograms;cumulative distribution;all RAKE receiver;ARAKE receiver;maximum-energy-capture selective RAKE receiver;SRAKE receiver;lower bounds;multipath;maximum-likelihood detector;single-path signal correlators;complexity;bit error probability;signal-to-noise ratio;SNR","","467","","74","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The designer can trade the energy efficiency of this sleep state for the latency associated with waking up the node. In addition, we integrate STEM with approaches that also leverage excess network density.

Stator and rotor flux in stator fixed coordinates are controlled instead of the stator current components in rotor field coordinates i/sub sd/ and i/sub sq/. In principle, the proposed method is based on driving the stator flux toward the reference stator flux vector defined by the input command, which are the reference torque and the reference rotor flux.

The performance of these signaling strategies is highly dependent on MIMO channel characteristics, which, in turn, depend on antenna height and spacing and richness of scattering. In practice, large antenna spacings are often required to achieve significant multiplexing or diversity gain. The use of dual-polarized antennas (polarization diversity) is a promising cost- and space-effective alternative, where two spatially separated uni-polarized antennas are replaced by a single antenna structure employing orthogonal polarizations. This paper investigates the performance of spatial multiplexing and transmit diversity (Alamouti (see IEEE J. Select. Areas Commun., vol.16, p.1451-58, Oct. 1998) scheme) in MIMO wireless systems employing dual-polarized antennas. In particular, we derive estimates for the uncoded average symbol error rate of spatial multiplexing and transmit diversity and identify channel conditions where the use of polarization diversity yields performance improvements. We show that while improvements in terms of symbol error rate of up to an order of magnitude are possible in the case of spatial multiplexing, the presence of polarization diversity generally incurs a performance loss for transmit diversity techniques. Finally, we provide simulation results to demonstrate that our estimates closely match the actual symbol error rates.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2002.803322","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1033685","","Polarization;MIMO;Diversity methods;Error analysis;Samarium;Transmitting antennas;Scattering;Transmitters;Receiving antennas;Laboratories","antenna arrays;telecommunication signalling;MIMO systems;diversity reception;electromagnetic wave polarisation;radio links;telecommunication network reliability;error statistics;multiplexing","multiantenna signaling techniques;polarization diversity;multiple-input multiple-output antenna systems;MIMO antenna systems;spatial multiplexing;spectral efficiency;transmit diversity;link reliability;MIMO channel characteristics;antenna height;antenna spacing;scattering;multiplexing gain;diversity gain;dual-polarized antennas;single antenna structure;orthogonal polarization;MIMO wireless systems;uncoded average symbol error rate;channel conditions;symbol error rate;simulation results","","199","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, the wavelet-based fractal analysis method was used to evaluate the gait of elderly subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease. The triaxial acceleration signals were measured close to the center of gravity of the body while the subject walked along a corridor and up and down stairs continuously. Signal measurements were recorded from 10 healthy young subjects and 11 elderly subjects. For comparison, two patients with Parkinson's disease participated in the level walking. The acceleration signal in each direction was decomposed to seven detailed signals at different wavelet scales by using the discrete wavelet transform. The variances of detailed signals at scales 7 to 1 were calculated. The fractal dimension of the acceleration signal was then estimated from the slope of the variance progression. The fractal dimensions were significantly different among the three types of walking for individual subjects (p < 0.01) and showed a high reproducibility. Our results suggest that the fractal dimensions are effective for classifying the walking types. Moreover, the fractal dimensions were significantly higher for the elderly subjects than for the young subjects (p < 0.01). For the patients with Parkinson's disease, the fractal dimensions tended to be higher than those of healthy subjects. These results suggest that the acceleration signals change into a more complex pattern with aging and with Parkinson's disease, and the fractal dimension can be used to evaluate the gait of elderly subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2002.802879","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1114839","","Legged locomotion;Wavelet analysis;Fractals;Pattern analysis;Parkinson's disease;Acceleration;Senior citizens;Discrete wavelet transforms;Signal analysis;Accelerometers","wavelet transforms;fractals;gait analysis;diseases;geriatrics;medical signal processing;acceleration measurement","walking patterns discrimination;wavelet-based fractal analysis;elderly subjects;Parkinson's disease patients;center of gravity;down stairs;healthy young subjects;walking along a corridor;up stairs;variance progression slope;gait evaluation;signal measurements","Acceleration;Activities of Daily Living;Adult;Aged;Aging;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Female;Fractals;Gait;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Parkinson Disease;Parkinson Disease;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Walking","142","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A good measure of software maintainability can help better manage the maintenance phase effort. Software maintainability cannot be adequately measured by only source code or by documents. The readability and understandability of both source code and documentation should be considered to measure the maintainability. This paper proposes an integrated measure of software maintainability. The paper also proposes a new representation for rule base of fuzzy models, which require less space for storage and will be efficient in finding the results in the simulation. The proposed model measures the software maintainability based on three important aspects of software-readability of source code (RSC), documentation quality (DOQ), and understandability of software (UOS). Keeping in view the nature of these parameters, a fuzzy approach has been used to integrate these three aspects. A new efficient representation of rule base has been proposed for fuzzy models. This integrated measurement of software maintainability, which to our knowledge is a first attempt to quantify integrated maintainability, is bound to be better than any other single parameter maintainability measurement approach. Thus the output of this model can advise the software project managers in judging the maintenance efforts of the software.","0149-144X","0-7803-7348-0","10.1109/RAMS.2002.981648","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=981648","","Software maintenance;Software measurement;Software quality;Documentation;Programming;Maintenance engineering;Educational institutions;Software systems;Phase measurement;Project management","software maintenance;system documentation;fuzzy set theory","software maintainability;software measurement;fuzzy model;rule base representation;source-code readability;documentation quality;fog index;maintenance phase;life-cycle phases;software understandability;software project managers","","41","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Severity analysis is performed using Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) as applied to architecture models. We combine severity and complexity factors to develop heuristic risk factors for the architecture components and connectors. Based on analysis scenarios, we develop a risk assessment model that represents components, connectors, component risk factors, connector risk factors, and probabilities of component interactions. We also develop a risk analysis algorithm that aggregates risk factors of components and connectors to the architectural level. Using the risk aggregation and the risk analysis model, we show how to analyze the overall risk factor of the architecture as the function of the risk factors of its constituting components and connectors.

The problem is motivated by the following observation. With many channel coding schemes, the energy required to transmit a packet can be significantly reduced by lowering transmission power and code rate and therefore transmitting the packet over a longer period of time. However, information is often time-critical or delay-sensitive and transmission times cannot be made arbitrarily long. We therefore consider packet transmission schedules that minimize energy subject to a deadline or a delay constraint. Specifically, we obtain an optimal offline schedule for a node operating under a deadline constraint. An inspection of the form of this schedule naturally leads us to an online schedule which is shown, through simulations, to perform closely to the optimal offline schedule. Taking the deadline to infinity, we provide an exact probabilistic analysis of our offline scheduling algorithm. The results of this analysis enable us to devise a lazy online algorithm that varies transmission times according to backlog. We show that this lazy schedule is significantly more energy-efficient compared to a deterministic (fixed transmission time) schedule that guarantees queue stability for the same range of arrival rates.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2002.801419","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1026006","","Energy efficiency;Optimal scheduling;Wireless sensor networks;Power control;Delay;Algorithm design and analysis;Wireless LAN;Batteries;Signal processing;Interference","channel coding;packet radio networks;power control;telecommunication control;delays;scheduling;statistical analysis;queueing theory","packet transmission;wireless link;energy efficient transmission;lazy schedules;channel coding;time-critical information;delay-sensitive information;queue stability;power control","","358","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"How iris recognition works","J. Daugman","Comput. Lab., Cambridge Univ., UK","Proceedings. International Conference on Image Processing","","2002","1","","I","I","The principle that underlies the recognition of persons by their iris patterns is the failure of a test of statistical independence on texture phase structure as encoded by multiscale quadrature wavelets. The combinatorial complexity of this phase information across different persons spans about 249 degrees of freedom and generates a discrimination entropy of about 3.2 bits/mm/sup 2/ over the iris, enabling real-time decisions about personal identity with extremely high confidence.

The model has two equations where cross-coupled parameters can be eliminated for the robustness of parameter estimation. Parameter estimation is improved by combining the model with a closed loop observer. This algorithm is suitable for online estimation.

A novel measurement technique was utilized, based on a wideband channel sounder and a spherical dual-polarized antenna array at the receiver. Data were collected over 9 km of continuous measurement routes, both indoor and outdoor. Our results show that in non-line-of-sight situations, the power distribution in elevation has a shape of a double-sided exponential function, with different slopes on the negative and positive sides of the peak. The slopes and the peak elevation angle depend on the environment and base-station antenna height. The cross-polarization power ratio varied within 6.6 and 11.4 dB, being lowest for indoor and highest for urban microcell environments. We applied the experimental data for analysis of the mean effective gain (MEG) of several mobile handset antenna configurations, with and without the user's head. The obtained MEG values varied from approximately -5 dBi in free space to less than -11 dBi beside the head model. These values are considerably lower than what is typically used in system specifications. The result shows that considering only the maximum gain or total efficiency of the antenna is not enough to describe its performance in practical operating conditions. For most antennas, the environment type has little effect on the MEG, but clear differences exist between antennas. The effect of the user's head on the MEG depends on the antenna type and on which side of the head the user holds the handset.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2002.800639","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1105924","","Power distribution;Mobile antennas;Antennas and propagation;Antenna measurements;Broadband antennas;Acoustic propagation;Power measurement;Frequency measurement;Goniometers;Radio propagation","microcellular radio;mobile antennas;mobile handsets;antenna arrays;indoor radio;antenna radiation patterns","angular power distribution;mean effective gain;mobile antenna;elevation angle distribution;cross-polarization power ratio;wideband channel sounder;spherical dual-polarized antenna array;indoor environments;urban microcell environments;mobile handset antenna;2.15 GHz;9 km","","160","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using a neural network to predict the muscle activations from EMG signals avoids establishing a complex mathematical model to express the muscle activation dynamics. The feed-forward neural network model of muscle activations applied here is composed of four layers and uses an adjusted back-propagation training algorithm. In this study, the basic back-propagation algorithm was not applicable, because muscle activation could not be measured, and hence the error between predicted activation and the real activation was not available. Thus, an adjusted back-propagation algorithm was developed. Joint torque at the elbow was calculated from the EMG signals of ten flexor and extensor muscles, using the neural network result of estimated activation of the muscles. Once muscle activations were obtained, Hill-type models were used to estimate muscle force. A musculoskeletal geometry model was then used to obtain moment arms, from which joint moments were determined and compared with measured values. The results show that this neural network model can be used to represent the relationship between EMG signals and joint moments well.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2002.1021584","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1021584","","Neural networks;Predictive models;Muscles;Electromyography;Mathematical model;Feedforward systems;Feedforward neural networks;Torque;Elbow;Musculoskeletal system","electromyography;biomechanics;neural nets;physiological models;backpropagation","artificial neural network;adjusted back-propagation training algorithm;basic back-propagation algorithm;muscle models;elbow joint torque;extensor muscles;flexor muscles;Hill-type models;musculoskeletal geometry model;real activation;predicted activation","Action Potentials;Algorithms;Elbow;Elbow Joint;Electromyography;Humans;Isometric Contraction;Models, Biological;Models, Neurological;Muscle, Skeletal;Neural Networks (Computer);Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Torque","98","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A key feature of the proposed approach is real-time assessment of terrain characteristics and incorporation of this information in the robot navigation strategy. Three terrain characteristics that strongly affect its traversability, namely, roughness, slope, and discontinuity, are extracted from video images obtained by on-board cameras. This traversability data is used to infer, in real time, the terrain Fuzzy Rule-Based Traversability Index, which succinctly quantifies the ease of traversal of the regional terrain by the mobile robot. A new traverse-terrain behavior is introduced that uses the regional traversability index to guide the robot to the safest and the most traversable terrain region. The regional traverse-terrain behavior is complemented by two other behaviors, local avoid-obstacle and global seek-goal. The recommendations of these three behaviors are integrated through adjustable weighting factors to generate the final motion command for the robot. The weighting factors are adjusted automatically, based on the situational context of the robot. The terrain assessment and robot navigation algorithms Are implemented on a Pioneer commercial robot and field-test studies are conducted. These studies demonstrate that the robot possesses intelligent decision-making capabilities that are brought to bear in negotiating hazardous terrain conditions during the robot motion.","2374-958X","","10.1109/TRA.2002.1019461","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019461","","Navigation;Robotics and automation;Mobile robots;Intelligent robots;Fuzzy logic;Data mining;Robot vision systems;Cameras;Decision making;Robot motion","fuzzy logic;mobile robots;position control","field mobile robots;behavior-based navigation;mobile robots;challenging terrain;fuzzy logic;terrain traversability;robot navigation;traversability;terrain assessment","","167","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Four open software development communities are described, examined and compared to help discover what these differences may be. Eight kinds of software informalisms are found to play a critical role in the elicitation, analysis, specification, validation and management of requirements for developing open software systems. Subsequently, understanding the roles these software informalisms take in a new formulation of the requirements development process for open source software is the focus of the study.

"A wideband CMOS sigma-delta modulator with incremental data weighted averaging","Tai-Haur Kuo; Kuan-Dar Chen; Horng-Ru Yeng","Dept. of Electr. Eng., Nat.

IDWA can achieve very good performance even when it is used with a low oversampling ratio (OSR), which reduces demands on circuit speed and power consumption. Therefore, the IDWA is highly suitable for wideband, low-power and small-area sigma-delta modulator (SDM) implementation. Incorporating the IDWA technique, a fourth-order feedforward (FF) SDM with an OSR of 12 and a 4-bit internal quantizer is implemented with a 2.5-V 0.25-/spl mu/m CMOS process. Measurement results show that the SDM operating from a 2.5-V supply voltage can achieve respective dynamic ranges (DRs) of 84/80 dB and spurious-free dynamic ranges (SFDRs) of 90/85 dB with signal bandwidths of 1.25/2 MHz at sampling frequencies of 30/48 MHz. The power dissipation is less than 105 mW and the active area is 2.6 mm/sup 2/.

However, to maximize the information content of the captured signals, the sensors need to be located appropriately, with due account given to the structural properties underlying the given system. In this paper, two numerical algorithms are proposed to achieve this goal. They aim to maximize the overall sensor response while minimizing the correlation among sensor outputs so as to minimize the redundant information provided by multiple sensors. The sensor responses of interest are the bus voltage magnitude, and the angle and frequency coherency indexes, which are estimated by means of a statistical sampling of power system response signals from a transient-stability program. Through the ""successive addition"" scheme, one of these algorithms easily incorporates mandatory locations such as tie-line busses and large generator step-up transformers. The proposed approaches are first illustrated on the Hydro-Quebec transmission grid and then on a 9-area/67-bus/23-machine test network designed with well-defined geographical boundaries and pre-specified weak interties between electrically coherent areas.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2002.1007908","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1007908","","Power system dynamics;Phasor measurement units;Power system measurements;State estimation;Control systems;Monitoring;Costs;Sensor systems;Frequency estimation;Power system control","power system interconnection;power system measurement;electric sensing devices;fault location;power system state estimation","distributed phasor measurement units configuration;dynamic performance measurement;large multiarea power systems;digital fault recorders;optimal sensor location;state estimation;wide-area control;wide-area monitoring;sensor outputs correlation minimisation;redundant information minimisation;sensor responses;bus voltage magnitude;frequency coherency indexes;angle indexes;statistical sampling;power system response signals;transient-stability program;tie-line buses;Hydro-Quebec transmission grid;9-area/67-bus/23-machine test network;geographical boundaries;pre-specified weak interties;electrically coherent areas;generator step-up transformers","","83","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A common scenario is a large disturbance such as a multi-phase fault near a load center that decelerate motor loads. Following fault clearing with transmission outages, motors raw very high current while simultaneously attempting to reaccelerate, and may stall if the power system is weak. Massive loss of load and possibly area instability and voltage collapse may follow. The authors describe actual incidents. Fast-acting generator excitation controls, fast-acting reactive power support devices (SVC, STATCOM, SMES), or fast load shedding can prevent voltage collapse. Proper analysis requires dynamic modeling of aggregated motor loads, with equivalents for distribution feeders. Power electronic based voltage support devices must be realistically modeled to determine required size, location, number, and type. Based on simulations, they conclude that voltage-sourced converter devices (STATCOM, SMES) are attractive countermeasures against load loss and voltage collapse.

The proposed method is used to model electric machines, power electronic converters, transformers, and transmission lines and to analyze power sources and loads with different connections (delta and wye). This method can also be applied to analyze steady-state (or transient phenomena) and unbalanced sources, including harmonics. Models obtained with this method are as simple as those of the per-phase approach. With the space-vector transformation, instantaneous active and reactive power concepts can be generalized, and new power system control strategies can be developed when power electronic converters are used. Steady-state, transient behavior, and harmonic analyses examples and applications are presented to illustrate the performance and advantages of the proposed method. This method can be extended to unbalanced systems (e.g., unsymmetric faults) using instantaneous symmetrical components in polyphase balanced circuits.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2002.804995","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1137581","","Power system analysis computing;Power system modeling;Power system transients;Transient analysis;Power system harmonics;Power system control;Power electronics;Harmonic analysis;Steady-state;Machine vector control","power system control;power system harmonics;power system analysis computing;harmonic analysis;control system analysis computing;power apparatus","power system analysis;space-vector transformation;control simulation;electric machines;power electronic converters;transformers;transmission lines;active power concepts;reactive power concepts;power system harmonics","","36","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A 175-mV multiply-accumulate test chip using a triple-well technology with tunable supply and body bias values is measured to experimentally verify the tradeoffs between the various sources of power. The test chip shows that there is an optimum V/sub DD//V/sub t/ operating point, although it differs from the theoretical limit because of excessive forward bias currents.

The distinguishing characteristics of these resource allocation formulations is that, by using convex optimization, they accommodate a variety of realistic QoS and fairness constraints. Their globally optimal solutions can be computed efficiently through polynomial time interior point methods, even though they use nonlinear objectives and constraints. Through power control in wireless cellular networks, we optimize SIR and delay for a particular QoS class, subject to QoS constraints for all other QoS classes. For wireless ad hoc networks with multihop transmissions and Rayleigh fading, we optimize various objectives, such as the overall system throughput, subject to constraints on power, probability of outage, and data rates. These formulations can also be used for admission control and relative pricing. Both proportional and minmax fairness can be implemented under the convex optimization framework, where fairness parameters can be jointly optimized with QoS criteria. Simple heuristics are also shown and tested using the convex optimization tools.","0743-166X","0-7803-7476-2","10.1109/INFCOM.2002.1019292","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019292","","Constraint optimization;Resource management;Quality of service;Ad hoc networks;Land mobile radio cellular systems;Cellular networks;Throughput;Power control;Interchannel interference;Spread spectrum communication","","","","119","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A relevant question to ask, though, is how systems and technology intended for information such as the intranet can be able to assist in the managing of knowledge. To understand this, we must examine the relationship between information and knowledge. Building on Polanyi's theories, the author argues that all knowledge is tacit, and what can be articulated and made tangible outside the human mind is merely information. However, information and knowledge affect one another. By adopting a multi perspective of the intranet where information, awareness, and communication are all considered, this interaction can best be supported and the intranet can become a useful and people-inclusive KM environment.","","0-7695-1435-9","10.1109/HICSS.2002.994043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=994043","","Knowledge management;Information technology;Explosions;Technology management;Humans;Management information systems;Ontologies","intranets;information systems;management science;operations research","knowledge management;information technology;IT;management science;IS;intranet;Polanyi theories;awareness;communication;KM environment","","31","","41","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The technique combines dynamic time warping (DTW) and support vector machines (SVMs) by establishing a new SVM kernel. We call this kernel Gaussian DTW (GDTW) kernel. This kernel approach has a main advantage over common HMM techniques. It does not assume a model for the generative class conditional densities. Instead, it directly addresses the problem of discrimination by creating class boundaries and thus is less sensitive to modeling assumptions. By incorporating DTW in the kernel function, general classification problems with variable-sized sequential data can be handled. In this respect the proposed method can be straightforwardly applied to all classification problems, where DTW gives a reasonable distance measure, e.g., speech recognition or genome processing. We show experiments with this kernel approach on the UNIPEN handwriting data, achieving results comparable to an HMM-based technique.","","0-7695-1692-0","10.1109/IWFHR.2002.1030883","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1030883","","Handwriting recognition;Support vector machines;Kernel;Hidden Markov models;Support vector machine classification;Nonlinear distortion;Pattern recognition;Optical character recognition software;Bayesian methods;Data structures","handwritten character recognition;real-time systems;learning automata;hidden Markov models;pattern classification;optimisation","online handwriting recognition;dynamic time warping;support vector machines;hidden Markov model;pattern classification;UNIPEN handwriting data;HMM model;kernel function;optimization","","101","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The size of the membership matrix is on the order of the original data set, a prohibitive size if this technique is to be applied to very large data sets with many clusters. Our implementation eliminates the storage of this data structure by combining the two updates into a single update of the cluster centers. This change significantly affects the asymptotic runtime as the new algorithm is linear with respect to the number of clusters, while the original is quadratic. Elimination of the membership matrix also reduces the overhead associated with repeatedly accessing a large data structure.

Apart from the bistable response, which was thermally induced, the nonlinear effects observed in the microrings were caused by the two-photon absorption process. Applications of microrings to realize all-optical logic gates are also proposed.","1558-4542","","10.1109/JSTQE.2002.1016376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1016376","","Optical signal processing;Optical resonators;Power semiconductor switches;Logic gates;Optical wavelength conversion;Four-wave mixing;Optical device fabrication;Optical switches;Multiplexing;Logic devices","gallium arsenide;aluminium compounds;III-V semiconductors;optical resonators;micro-optics;optical pumping;optical bistability;multiwave mixing;two-photon processes;optical logic;high-speed optical techniques;time division multiplexing;demultiplexing","optical signal processing;nonlinear semiconductor microring resonators;compact semiconductor microring resonators;high finesse values;picosecond cavity lifetimes;all-optical switches;all-optical multiplexers;all-optical logic gates;switching power;field enhancement;wavelength conversion efficiency;four wave mixing;bistability;picosecond switching;pump excitation;probe excitation;optical time-division demultiplexing;spatial pulse routing;four-wave mixing;GaAs-AlGaAs microring resonators;bistable response;thermally induced;nonlinear effects;two-photon absorption process;GaAs-AlGaAs","","171","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These kind of networks are very flexible, thus they do not require any existing infrastructure or central administration. Therefore, mobile ad-hoc networks are suitable for temporary communication links. The biggest challenge in this kind of networks is to find a path between the communication end points, what is aggravated through the node mobility. In this paper we present a new on-demand routing algorithm for mobile, multi-hop ad-hoc networks. The protocol is based on swarm intelligence and especially on the ant colony based meta heuristic. These approaches try to map the solution capability of swarms to mathematical and engineering problems. The introduced routing protocol is highly adaptive, efficient and scalable. The main goal in the design of the protocol was to reduce the overhead for routing. We refer to the protocol as the ant-colony-based routing algorithm (ARA).","1530-2016","0-7695-1680-7","10.1109/ICPPW.2002.1039715","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1039715","","Mobile ad hoc networks;Ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Ant colony optimization;Spread spectrum communication;Particle swarm optimization;Routing protocols;Mobile computing;Computer science;Wireless communication","mobile radio;telecommunication network routing;protocols","mobile nodes;radio;temporary communication links;communication end points;on-demand routing algorithm;mobile multi-hop ad-hoc networks;swarm intelligence;ant colony based meta heuristic;mathematical problems;engineering problems;ant colony based routing algorithm","","162","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These applications include small-scale, precision staging devices (magnetically driven), low-speed, large mass catapult launchers, low-speed and high-speed trains, high-speed, long-range fire support naval guns, and the futuristic application of high-speed, direct satellite launch to space. The force requirements range from a few Newtons to millions of Newtons, and the pulsed electrical power requirements range from kilowatts to gigawatts. For repetitive operation, the average prime power requirements range from a few watts to megawatts. The principal technical challenges for such propulsive devices and motors are achieving high thrust and high coil strength, producing and controlling high power levels, and maintaining good weight, volume, and efficiency characteristics. These challenges will be discussed, using coilgun mass launcher and pulsed linear induction motor technology examples. Basic parameters for a long-range fire support coilgun are a muzzle velocity of 2.0 to 2.5 km/s, with a projectile mass of 20 to 60 kg. The kinetic energy is thus around 100 to 200 MJ. To achieve the pulsed power needed for launch from a barrel of less than 20 m, peak coil voltages and currents on the order of 40 kV and 500 kA to 1 MA are needed. Train propulsion is somewhat lower in power demand. The kinetic power for a typical low-speed urban Maglev system would be in the range of 500 kW average power, driven by a power source of some 25 kV peak and 50 A peak. The added requirement of low weight and small volume power conditioning make this application challenging as well. The challenges and solutions for high-voltage power conditioning system designs are reviewed from these examples.","1076-8467","0-7803-7540-8","10.1109/MODSYM.2002.1189573","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1189573","","Coilguns;Electromagnetic launching;Voltage;Space technology;Magnetic levitation;Fires;Coils;Power conditioning;EMP radiation effects;Electromagnetic forces","electromagnetic launchers;railways;weapons;pulsed power supplies;linear induction motors;magnetic levitation","coilgun electromagnetic propulsion technology;vehicle application;long range gun application;high voltage technology;pulsed power technology;electromagnetic launch;small-scale precision staging devices;low-speed;large mass catapult launchers;high-speed trains;long-range fire support naval guns;direct satellite launch;force requirements;pulsed electrical power requirements;repetitive operation;high coil strength;high thrust;high power levels;coilgun mass launcher;pulsed linear induction motor;muzzle velocity;projectile mass;peak coil voltages;peak coil currents;kinetic power;low-speed urban Maglev system;high-voltage power conditioning system design;2.0 to 2.5 km/s;20 to 60 kg;100 to 200 MJ;40 kV;500 kA to 1 MA;500 kW;25 kV;50 A","","21","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We find that enhancement based on the FWT suffers from one serious drawback-the introduction of visible artifacts when large structures are enhanced strongly. By contrast, the Laplacian Pyramid allows a smooth enhancement of large structures, such that visible artifacts can be avoided. Only for the enhancement of very small details, for denoising applications or compression of images, the FWT may have some advantages over the Laplacian Pyramid.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2002.1000258","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1000258","","Radiography;Laplace equations;Wavelet transforms;Noise reduction;Image coding;Frequency;Mammography;Biomedical imaging;X-ray imaging;Computed tomography","image enhancement;mammography;medical image processing;diagnostic radiography;wavelet transforms","multiscale contrast enhancement;Laplacian Pyramid;very small details;denoising applications;images compression;fast wavelet transform;medical diagnostic imaging;visible artifacts","Algorithms;Artifacts;Female;Fourier Analysis;Humans;Mammography;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Radiographic Image Enhancement;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Skull","118","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nakaoka","NA; NA; NA; NA","24th Annual International Telecommunications Energy Conference","","2002","","","303","308","The low harmonic currents in input side is required by the legislation of regulations for controlling harmonics. The power conversion system which has a 3-phase AC power source and isolated DC output power is widely applied for the telecommunication system over several kVa. The conventional DC 48 V output power supply for the telecommunication system have the 3-phase PWM rectifier in the first step in order to obtain the sinusoidal input current waveforms. In addition to this, the conventional power supply has the DC-DC converter which is isolated between input side and output one in a second step to obtain 48 V DC. As described above, the conventional power supply is composed of two power converters; 3-phase PWM rectifier and DC-DC converter. For this reason, the conventional power supply causes the low power efficiency and high cost. To solve this problem, the power conversion system which has a flyback converter has been already proposed. Using the flyback converter, this power conversion system can convert 3-phase AC input power into the isolated DC output power. However, the high voltage and the enlargement of turn off current across the power semiconductor devices does not allow the higher efficiency and larger capacity in this power conversion system to be obtained. This paper presents a novel forward rectifier which can directly convert 3-phase AC input into the isolated 48 V DC. The proposed rectifier consists of a power converter which is connected in 3-phase line to line. By controlling the duty factor of each active switch, the proposed rectifier has sinusoidal waveforms with unity power factor. The benefit of the proposed rectifier is lower peak current in each power semiconductor device because this rectifier is a forward type power converter system. For this reason, the proposed forward rectifier is suitable for the high power applications such as telecommunication power supply. In this paper, the design concept and the feasible performance evaluations of the novel forward rectifier is proposed and discussed. In the experimental result performed by using 1.4 kW experimental set-up, the power efficiency of 92.1% and the input current meeting the requirement of harmonic current regulations of EEC 6100-3-2 class A are obtained.","","0-7803-7512-2","10.1109/INTLEC.2002.1048672","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1048672","","Pulse width modulation;Rectifiers;Thyristors;Power supplies;Power conversion;Power generation;DC-DC power converters;Analog-digital conversion;Power semiconductor devices;Legislation","telecommunication power supplies;rectifying circuits;power conversion harmonics;harmonics suppression;PWM power convertors","high power-factor 3-phase PWM rectifier;input side harmonic currents;legislation;harmonics control;power conversion system;3-phase AC power source;isolated DC output power;telecommunication system;sinusoidal input current;3-phase PWM rectifier;sinusoidal input current waveforms;DC-DC converter;flyback converter;power semiconductor devices;3-phase line to line connection;duty factor control;active switch;power semiconductor device;telecommunication power supply;EEC 6100-3-2 class A;48 V;1.4 kW;92.1 percent","","5","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

High-pass filters in particular are used when the reference generator is required to produce an ""everything but the fundamental"" target waveform. This paper presents a stationary frame notch filter equivalent to a high-pass synchronous frame harmonic reference generator for such systems. The use of the stationary frame allows for quicker calculation of the reference generation in a discrete digital implementation, and also allows classical control techniques to be used to analyze the active filter system without requiring synchronous frame transformations of the outside system model. Both simulation (continuous and discrete) and experimental results showing the equivalency of the stationary and synchronous frame reference generation process are presented using both shift and delta-operator-based infinite-impulse response digital filters.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2002.804739","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1058114","","Power harmonic filters;Active filters;Synchronous generators;Control systems;Low pass filters;Digital filters;Topology;Current measurement;Inverters","power system harmonics;power harmonic filters;active filters;notch filters;harmonic distortion","active power filter systems;stationary frame harmonic reference generation;low-pass filter functions;high-pass filter functions;stationary frame notch filter;synchronous frame reference generation process;stationary frame reference generation process;delta-operator-based infinite-impulse response digital filters;shift-operator-based infinite-impulse response digital filters","","113","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Ward","QinetiQ, Malvern, UK; NA; NA","RADAR 2002","","2002","","","429","433","Radar performance prediction has always been an important part of the design and development of radar systems. Performance prediction offers a way of extending limited trials results obtained for the environmental conditions on the day to the full envelope of desired operation. The analysis of radar performance in free space is well documented and understood but the modelling of the radar target in a clutter environment is still an area of active research. This paper concentrates on airborne maritime radar. The key to obtaining realistic predictions of the probability of detecting a target on the sea surface is governed by the spatial and temporal statistics and correlation properties of the sea clutter. Radar detection is governed by the combination of the mean radar cross-section of the clutter and the temporal fluctuations of the pulse-by-pulse radar returns about the mean. Here, two models for the mean radar cross-section of the clutter are compared.","0537-9989","0-85296-750-0","10.1109/RADAR.2002.1174742","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174742","","Radar clutter;Radar cross section;Spaceborne radar;Radar detection;Performance analysis;Airborne radar;Probability;Sea surface;Statistics;Fluctuations","radar clutter;radar detection;airborne radar;marine radar;radar cross-sections;correlation methods;statistical analysis;probability","radar sea clutter models;radar performance prediction;radar systems;radar target modelling;airborne maritime radar;target detection probability;sea surface;temporal statistics;spatial statistics;correlation properties;mean radar cross-section;RCS;radar detection performance","","3","","12","","","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Aura aims to minimize distractions on a user's attention, creating an environment that adapts to the user's context and needs. Aura is specifically intended for pervasive computing environments involving wireless communication, wearable or handheld computers, and smart spaces. Human attention is an especially scarce resource in such environments, because the user is often preoccupied with walking, driving, or other real-world interactions. In addition, mobile computing poses difficult challenges such as intermittent and variable-bandwidth connectivity, concern for battery life, and the client resource constraints that weight and size considerations impose. To accomplish its ambitious goals, research in Aura spans every system level: from the hardware, through the operating system, to applications and end users. Underlying this diversity of concerns, Aura applies two broad concepts. First, it uses proactivity, which is a system layer's ability to anticipate requests from a higher layer. In today's systems, each layer merely reacts to the layer above it. Second, Aura is self-tuning: layers adapt by observing the demands made on them and adjusting their performance and resource usage characteristics accordingly. Currently, system-layer behavior is relatively static. Both of these techniques will help lower demand for human attention.","1558-2590","","10.1109/MPRV.2002.1012334","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1012334","","Pervasive computing;Humans;Computer networks;Context;Wireless communication;Handheld computers;Legged locomotion;Mobile computing;Batteries;Hardware","mobile computing;user interfaces","Aura;mobile computing;client resource constraints;battery life;pervasive computing","","435","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

For a given number of channels, optimization of performance is desirable to ensure high quality volume images. To find optimal layouts, several approaches have been followed with varying success. The most promising designs proposed are Vernier arrays, but also these suffer from high peaks in the sidelobe region compared with a dense array. In this work, we propose new methods based on the principles of suppression of grating lobes to form symmetric and non-symmetric regular sparse periodic and radially periodic designs. The proposed methods extend the concept of sparse periodic layouts by exploiting either an increased number of symmetry axes or radial symmetry. We also introduce two new strategies to form designs with nonoverlapping elements. The performance of the new layouts range from the performance of Vernier arrays to almost that of dense arrays. Our designs have simplicity in construction, flexibility in the number of active elements, and the possibility of trade off sidelobe peaks against sidelobe energy.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2002.1026019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1026019","","Phased arrays;Ultrasonic imaging;Real time systems;Ultrasonic transducers;Gratings;Biomedical imaging;Medical diagnostic imaging;Surgery;Rendering (computer graphics)","ultrasonic transducer arrays;ultrasonic imaging;biomedical ultrasonics;real-time systems;biomedical transducers","real-time 3D ultrasound systems;real-time 3D US imaging;3D phased array imaging;sparse 2D layouts;high quality volume images;optimal layouts;grating lobes suppression;symmetric designs;nonsymmetric designs;regular sparse periodic designs;radially periodic designs;nonoverlapping elements;medical imaging","Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Ultrasonography","123","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this correspondence, the FrFT is applied to airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) slow-moving target detection. For airborne SAR, the echo from a ground moving target can be regarded approximately as a chirp signal, and the FrFT is a way to concentrate the energy of a chirp signal. Therefore, the FrFT presents a potentially effective technique for ground moving target detection in airborne SAR. Compared with the common Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD) algorithm, the FrFT is a linear operator, and will not be influenced by cross-terms even if multiple moving targets exist. Moreover, to solve the problem whereby weak targets are shadowed by the sidelobes of strong ones, a new implementation of the CLEAN technique is proposed based on filtering in the fractional Fourier domain. In this way strong moving targets and weak ones can be detected iteratively. This combined method is demonstrated by using raw clutter data combined with simulated moving targets.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2002.1145767","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1145767","","Fourier transforms;Object detection;Chirp;Synthetic aperture radar;Radar signal processing;Filtering;Radar detection;Signal processing algorithms;Clutter;Airborne radar","synthetic aperture radar;airborne radar;radar detection;Fourier transforms;radar signal processing;chirp modulation;radar clutter","fractional Fourier transform;ground moving target detection;radar signal processing;airborne synthetic aperture radar;chirp signal;Wigner-Ville distribution algorithm;CLEAN technique;radar clutter","","104","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Six Sigma methodology has evolved into a statistically oriented approach to process, product or service quality improvement. It is a business performance improvement strategy used to improve profitability, to drive out waste in business processes and to improve the efficiency of all operations that meet or exceed customers' needs and expectations. A performance level of Six Sigma equates to 3-4 defects per million opportunities, where sigma is a statistical measure of the amount of variation around the process average. The average sigma level for most companies is three sigma. The authors offer guidance as to how companies may achieve Six Sigma performance. Organisations that have adopted the principles and concepts of Six Sigma methodology have realised that once they have achieved Five Sigma quality levels the only way to surpass the Five Sigma quality level is to redesign their products, processes and services from scratch. These circumstances have led to the development of what we call today 'design for Six Sigma'.

The parameters are estimated by matching vascular landmarks by recursively tracing the blood vessel structure. The parameter estimation technique, which could be generalized to other applications, is a hierarchy of models and methods, making the algorithm robust to unmatchable image features and mismatches between features caused by large interframe motions. Experiments involving 3,000 image pairs from 16 different healthy eyes were performed. Final registration errors less than a pixel are routinely achieved.

Many error-correcting codes have been applied to OFDM. Recently, LDPC codes have attracted much attention. The performance of LDPC codes is very close to the Shannon limit, with practical decoding complexity. We proposed LDPC coded OFDM (LDPC-COFDM) systems with BPSK and showed that the LDPC codes are effective in improving the bit error rate (BER) of OFDM in multipath environments (see Futaki, H. and Ohtsuki, T., IEEE VTC2001 fall, vol.1, p.82-6, 2001). LDPC codes can be decoded using a probability propagation algorithm known as the sum-product algorithm or belief propagation. To clarify iterative decoding properties in LDPC-COFDM systems, we first investigate the distribution of the number of iterations where the decoding algorithm stops. In mobile communications, multilevel modulation is preferred for high bandwidth efficiency. However, it has not been clarified how to apply LDPC codes to OFDM systems with multilevel modulation. We propose a decoding algorithm for the LDPC-COFDM systems with M-PSK. By simulation, we show that LDPC-COFDM systems achieve good error rate performance with a small number of iterations on both AWGN and frequency-selective fading channels. We confirm that the algorithm for LDPC-COFDM systems with M-PSK work correctly.","","0-7803-7400-2","10.1109/ICC.2002.997138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=997138","","Parity check codes;Iterative decoding;Bit error rate;Iterative algorithms;OFDM modulation;Data communication;Error correction codes;Binary phase shift keying;Sum product algorithm;Belief propagation","modulation coding;OFDM modulation;AWGN channels;error statistics;fading channels;iterative decoding;phase shift keying;data communication;multipath channels;error correction codes;computational complexity;mobile radio","low-density parity-check codes;coded OFDM;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;high-bit-rate data transmission;multipath environments;error-correcting codes;decoding complexity;Shannon limit;BPSK;bit error rate;BER;error rate performance;probability propagation algorithm;sum-product algorithm;belief propagation;iterative decoding;mobile communications;AWGN channels;frequency-selective fading channels","","35","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One such application is prevention of biofouling, an effect that is based on reversible electroporation of cell membranes. Pulsed electric fields of several kilovolts per centimeter amplitude and submicrosecond duration have been found to prevent the growth of aquatic nuisance species on surfaces. Reversible electroporation is also used for medical applications, e.g., for delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs into tumor cells, for gene therapy and for transdermal drug delivery. Higher electric fields cause irreversible membrane damage. Pulses in the microsecond range with electric field intensities in the tens of kilovolts per centimeter are used for bacterial decontamination of water and liquid food. A new type of field-cell interaction utilizing nanosecond pulses with electric fields exceeding 50 kV/cm has been recently added to known bioelectric effects. Based on capacitive coupling to cell substructures, it has the potential to affect transport processes across subcellular membranes and may be used for gene transfer into cell nuclei. Other studies indicate that it triggers intracellular processes such as programmed cell death that can be used for cancer treatment. In order to generate the required electric fields for these processes, high-voltage high-current sources are required. The pulse duration needs to be short to prevent thermal effects.

In addition to meeting the minimum turn-on and turn-off time requirements for high-power semiconductor switches, the proposed technique excludes from the synthesized waveform any pulses that are either too narrow or too wide. By using a systematic method, only the polarities and the number of levels need to be determined for different modulation levels.

In this paper, extensive empirical studies are carried out to investigate the convergence properties of an evolution strategy using an approximate fitness function on two benchmark problems. It is found that incorrect convergence will occur if the approximate model has false optima. To address this problem, individual- and generation-based evolution control are introduced and the resulting effects on the convergence properties are presented. A framework for managing approximate models in generation-based evolution control is proposed. This framework is well suited for parallel evolutionary optimization, which is able to guarantee the correct convergence of the evolutionary algorithm, as well as to reduce the computation cost as much as possible.

These bounds are validated using experimental data from a 118-182-kHz sonar, showing an accuracy of the order of 20 microns on the ping-to-ping cross-track displacements. Next, the accuracy required on the DPCA sway and yaw in order to achieve a given synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) beampattern specification, specified by the expected SAS array gain, is computed as a function of the number P of pings in the SAS. Higher accuracy is required when P increases to counter the accumulation of errors during the integration of the elementary ping-to-ping estimates: the standard deviation must decrease as P/sup -1/2/ for the DPCA sway and P/sup -3/2/ for the yaw. Finally, by combining the above results, the lower bounds on DPCA micronavigation accuracy are established. These bounds set an upper limit to the SAS length achievable in practice. The maximum gain Q in cross-range resolution achievable by a DPCA micronavigated SAS is computed as a function of the key SAS parameters.

The aim of the present work is to enhance convergence through two modifications: a filter technique to guide the choice of the step length and an altered search direction in order to avoid convergence to a nonminimizing stationary point. A reduction in computational time is also gained through solving a positive definite matrix for the search direction. Numerical tests on standard IEEE systems and on a realistic network are very encouraging and show that the new algorithm converges where other algorithms fail.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2002.800870","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1033707","","Load flow;Dispatching;Linear programming;Convergence;Filters;Linear matrix inequalities;Sparse matrices;Symmetric matrices;System testing;Power generation dispatch","power system analysis computing;load dispatching;load flow;optimisation","optimal power flow dispatching;primal-dual interior point method;linear programming;filter technique;altered search direction;nonminimizing stationary point convergence prevention;computational time;positive definite matrix;computer simulation","","84","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This method employs a second-degree minimax polynomial approximation to obtain an accurate initial estimate of the reciprocal and the inverse square root values, and then performs a modified Goldschmidt iteration. The high accuracy of the initial approximation allows us to obtain double-precision results by computing a single Goldschmidt iteration, significantly reducing the latency of the algorithm. Two unfolded architectures are proposed: the first one computing only reciprocal and division operations, and the second one also including the computation of square root and inverse square root. The execution times and area costs for both architectures are estimated, and a comparison with other multiplicative-based methods is presented. The results of this comparison show the achievement of a lower latency than these methods, with similar hardware requirements.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2002.1146704","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1146704","","Polynomials;Delay;Signal processing algorithms;Minimax techniques;Approximation algorithms;Computer architecture;Hardware;High performance computing;Iterative algorithms;Convergence","floating point arithmetic;polynomial approximation;iterative methods;minimax techniques","high-speed double-precision computation;double-precision floating-point reciprocal operations;double-precision floating-point division operations;double-precision floating-point square root operations;double-precision floating-point inverse square root operations;second-degree minimax polynomial approximation;accurate initial estimate;modified Goldschmidt iteration;unfolded architectures;execution times;area costs;multiplicative-based methods;latency;hardware requirements","","65","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The visual-field sensitivity test is commonly used in a clinical setting to evaluate glaucoma. Standard automated perimetry (SAP) is a common computerized visual-field test whose output is amenable to machine learning. We compared the performance of a number of machine learning algorithms with STATPAC indexes mean deviation, pattern standard deviation, and corrected pattern standard deviation. The machine learning algorithms studied included multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and linear (LDA) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), Parzen window, mixture of Gaussian (MOG), and mixture of generalized Gaussian (MGG). MLP and SVM are classifiers that work directly on the decision boundary and fall under the discriminative paradigm. Generative classifiers, which first model the data probability density and then perform classification via Bayes' rule, usually give deeper insight into the structure of the data space. We have applied MOG, MGG, LDA, QDA, and Parzen window to the classification of glaucoma from SAP. Performance of the various classifiers was compared by the areas under their receiver operating characteristic curves and by sensitivities (true-positive rates) at chosen specificities (true-negative rates). The machine-learning-type classifiers showed improved performance over the best indexes from STATPAC. Forward-selection and backward-elimination methodology further improved the classification rate and also has the potential to reduce testing time by diminishing the number of visual-field location measurements.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2002.802012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1028420","","Machine learning;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Optical receivers;Optical sensors;Machine learning algorithms;Linear discriminant analysis;Magnetic heads;Automatic testing;Multilayer perceptrons","eye;vision defects;multilayer perceptrons;vectors;probability;learning (artificial intelligence);neurophysiology;neural nets;medical diagnostic computing","Bayes rule;standard automated perimetry;support vector machine;glaucoma diagnosis;optic nerve head;visual field;clinical setting;computerized visual-field test;machine learning algorithms;quadratic discriminant analysis;Parzen window;mixture of Gaussian;generalized Gaussian;data probability density;true-positive rate;visual-field location measurements number","Artificial Intelligence;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;False Negative Reactions;False Positive Reactions;Glaucoma;Humans;Models, Statistical;Neural Networks (Computer);Optic Nerve Diseases;Perimetry;Predictive Value of Tests;ROC Curve;Sensitivity and Specificity","102","","68","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Another approach by which these coefficients can be obtained is the observer method, in which a model-based estimation algorithm predicts the coefficients. In this paper, the hydrodynamic coefficients are estimated using two nonlinear observers - a sliding mode observer and an extended Kalman filter. Their performances are evaluated by comparing the estimated coefficients obtained from the two observer methods with the values as determined from the PMM test. By using the estimated coefficients, a sliding mode controller is constructed for the diving and steering maneuver.

Voltage stability of the regional network may be a main limitation with respect to maximum rating and operation of the wind power plant Technical constraints in relation to wind power integration in weak grids may in general be associated with limited thermal capacity in parts of the grid and/or the adverse effect wind power can have on voltage quality and stability. In certain situations, however, local constraints regarding development of new transmission lines or upgrading of existing lines can make it interesting to utilise the existing lines to a level which in worst case may imply operation beyond the normal technical constraints of the system.

This allows aging failures to be easily included in existing reliability evaluation techniques and tools.

The BC Hydro North Metro system was used as an example to demonstrate an application of the proposed method and models.

The most penetration testing can hope for is to be the science of insecurity - not the science of security nasmuch as penetration testing can at most prove insecurity by falsifying the hypothesis that any system, network, or application is secure. To be a science of security would require falsifiable hypotheses that any given system, network, or application was insecure, something that could only be done if the number of potential insecurities were known and enumerated such that the penetration tester could thereby falsify (test) a known-to-be-complete list of vulnerabilities claimed to not be present. Because the list of potential insecurities is unknowable and hence unenumerable, no penetration tester can prove security, just as no doctor can prove that you are without occult disease. Putting it as Picasso did, ""Art is a lie that shows the truth"" and security by penetration testing is a lie in that on a good day can show the truth. These incompleteness and proof-by-demonstration characteristics of penetration testing ensure that it remains an art so long as high rates of technical advance remains brisk and hence enumeration of vulnerabilities an impossibility.

In most of such applications, the performance of an AR system depends highly on the tracking system for visual marker detection, tracking, and pose estimation. Currently, there are more than one marker based tracking/calibration systems available. It is thus desirable for the user to know which marker tracking system is likely to perform the best for a specific AR application. For this purpose, we compare several marker systems all using planar square coded visual markers. We present the evaluation results, both qualitatively and quantitatively, for the usability, efficiency, accuracy, and reliability. For a particular AR application, there are different marker detection and tracking requirements. Therefore, the purpose of this work is not to rank existing marker systems; instead, we try to analyze the strength and weakness of various aspects of the marker tracking systems and provide AR application developers with this information.","","0-7695-1781-1","10.1109/ISMAR.2002.1115078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1115078","","Decoding;Augmented reality;Tracking;Calibration;Computer aided manufacturing;Military computing;Computer displays;Cameras;Thyristors;Performance evaluation","augmented reality;optical tracking;feature extraction","visual marker detection;visual marker decoding;augmented reality;visual marker pose estimation;planar square coded visual markers;usability;efficiency;accuracy;reliability","","90","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Out-of-plane displacement (warpage) is a global effect of interfacial stress and displacement. It is also the cause of mis-registration and noncontact between components and their substrates. Moire methods offer noncontact, full-field, high-resolution approaches for measuring warpage. In this paper, two types of Moire methods are introduced and analyzed. They carry distinct features and grant more options to measure warpage under various scenarios.

Four different artificial neural networks are presented for the recognition of three different patterns in the respiration signals (normal breathing, hypopnea, and apnea). Two networks process the normalized respiration signals directly, while another two use sophisticatedly preprocessed signals. The development of the networks was based on training sets from the polysomnographic records of nine different patients. The detection performance of the networks was tested and compared by using up to 8000 untrained breathing patterns from 16 different patients. The networks which classified the preprocessed respiration signals produced an average detection performance of over 90%.

Eng., Tel Aviv Univ., Israel; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","","2002","10","2","171","186","The objective of this paper is to investigate the innovative concept of complex fuzzy sets. The novelty of the complex fuzzy set lies in the range of values its membership function may attain. In contrast to a traditional fuzzy membership function, this range is not limited to [0, 1], but extended to the unit circle in the complex plane. Thus, the complex fuzzy set provides a mathematical framework for describing membership in a set in terms of a complex number. The inherent difficulty in acquiring intuition for the concept of complex-valued membership presents a significant obstacle to the realization of its full potential. Consequently, a major part of this work is dedicated to a discussion of the intuitive interpretation of complex-valued grades of membership. Examples of possible applications, which demonstrate the new concept, include a complex fuzzy representation of solar activity (via measurements of the sunspot number), and a signal processing application. A comprehensive study of the mathematical properties of the complex fuzzy set is presented. Basic set theoretic operations on complex fuzzy sets, such as complex fuzzy complement, union, and intersection, are discussed at length. Two novel operations, namely set rotation and set reflection, are introduced. Complex fuzzy relations are also considered.

"Segmentation of ultrasound B-mode images with intensity inhomogeneity correction","Guofang Xiao; M. Brady; J. A. Noble; Yongyue Zhang","Dept. of Eng. Sci., Oxford Univ., UK; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","","2002","21","1","48","57","Displayed ultrasound (US) B-mode images often exhibit tissue intensity inhomogeneities dominated by nonuniform beam attenuation within the body. This is a major problem for intensity-based, automatic segmentation of video-intensity images because conventional threshold-based or intensity-statistic-based approaches do not work well in the presence of such image distortions. Time gain compensation (TGC) is typically used in standard US machines in an attempt to overcome this. However this compensation method is position-dependent which means that different tissues in the same TGC time-range (or corresponding depth range) will be, incorrectly, compensated by the same amount. Compensation should really be tissue-type dependent but automating this step is difficult. The main contribution of this paper is to develop a method for simultaneous estimation of video-intensity inhomogeneities and segmentation of US image tissue regions. The method uses a combination of the maximum a posteriori (MAP) and Markov random field (MRF) methods to estimate the US image distortion field assuming it follows a multiplicative model while at the same time labeling image regions based on the corrected intensity statistics. The MAP step is used to estimate the intensity model parameters while the MRF step provides a novel way of incorporating the distributions of image tissue classes as a spatial smoothness constraint. We explain how this multiplicative model can be related to the ultrasonic physics of image formation to justify our approach. Experiments are presented on synthetic images and a gelatin phantom to evaluate quantitatively the accuracy of the method. We also discuss qualitatively the application of the method to clinical breast and cardiac US images. Limitations of the method and potential clinical applications are outlined in the conclusion.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.981233","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=981233","","Image segmentation;Ultrasonic imaging;Attenuation;Markov random fields;Costs;Biomedical imaging;Medical diagnostic imaging;Biomedical engineering;Image analysis;Lesions","biomedical ultrasonics;image segmentation;medical image processing;ultrasonic absorption;biological tissues;Markov processes;parameter estimation","ultrasound B-mode images segmentation;intensity inhomogeneity correction;tissue intensity inhomogeneities;nonuniform beam attenuation;video-intensity images;time gain compensation;medical diagnostic imaging;image tissue classes distribution;multiplicative model;spatial smoothness constraint;gelatin phantom","Algorithms;Artifacts;Bayes Theorem;Breast Neoplasms;Computer Simulation;Echocardiography, Three-Dimensional;Feasibility Studies;Heart Ventricles;Humans;Image Enhancement;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Markov Chains;Models, Statistical;Phantoms, Imaging;Sensitivity and Specificity;Stochastic Processes;Ultrasonography, Doppler, Duplex","116","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For a specific PZT-5H sample considered, a mechanical stress-limited work cycle indicates that this material can handle 330 W/cm/sup 3/ at 100 kHz.

Closed-form expressions for the deterministic Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) on direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for the considered class of sensor arrays are derived. Comparison of these expressions with simulation results show that the finite-sample performance of RARE algorithms in both time-invariant and time-varying array cases is close to the corresponding bounds.

Lab., Univ. of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA","IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management","","2002","49","4","479","490","Product take-back laws have been enacted in the Netherlands, and the European Commission is expected to follow suit. The legislation mandates that manufacturers bear the economic burden of collection and disposal of products at the end of their useful lives. Reuse or remanufacturing of some components might be more cost-effective than disposal and provide an opportunity for recovery of their economic value. However, manufacturers have not traditionally engaged in the long-range planning over several product lifecycles that cost-effective reuse or remanufacturing requires. This paper develops a model for incorporating long-range planning for component reuse in product design. The model employs a product portfolio approach based on market segmentation, rather than a single product. The model is embedded in a decision tool that aids in determining when a product should be taken back, and which components should be reused, recycled, or disposed. A case study of a line of personal computers (PCs) demonstrates an implementation of the model. It also shows that if product take-back is mandated, it is in the PC manufacturer's best interest to shift from selling a product to essentially selling a service by controlling when the product is taken back and, thus, effectively creating a leasing program. The portfolio approach creates opportunities for the design engineer to distribute the cost, reliability, and environmental impacts of component reuse, remanufacture, and recycling in such a way that the end result is higher customer satisfaction than designing one product for all customer groups.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2002.807292","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176873","","Environmental factors;Product development;Microcomputers","design for environment;recycling;product development;microcomputers","component reuse;component remanufacture;component recycling;product portfolio design;Netherlands;European Commission;legislation;economic burden;product collection;product disposal;product lifecycles;cost-effective reuse;long-range planning;product design;market segmentation;decision tool;personal computers;product take-back;leasing program;portfolio approach;cost;reliability;environmental impacts","","93","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Because channel state information is impossible to be known perfectly at the transmitter in practical wireless systems, we design, in this paper, an optimal multiantenna transmitter based on the knowledge of mean values of the underlying channels. Our optimal transmitter design turns out to be an eigen-beamformer with multiple beams pointing to orthogonal directions along the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix of the estimated channel at the transmitter and with proper power loading across beams. The optimality pertains to minimizing an upper bound on the symbol error rate, which leads to better performance than maximizing the expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver. Coupled with orthogonal space-time block codes, two-directional eigen-beamforming emerges as a more attractive choice than conventional one-directional beamforming with uniformly improved performance, without rate reduction, and without essential increase in complexity. With multiple receive antennas and reasonably good feedback quality, the two-directional eigen-beamformer is also capable of achieving the best possible performance in a large range of transmit-power-to-noise ratios, without a rate penalty.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2002.803355","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1033689","","Transmitters;Block codes;Feedback;Channel state information;Upper bound;Error analysis;Signal to noise ratio;Optical coupling;Array signal processing;Receiving antennas","optimisation;transmitting antennas;antenna arrays;feedback;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;array signal processing;block codes;correlation methods;matrix algebra;noise;receiving antennas;diversity reception;land mobile radio;fading channels","optimal transmitter eigen-beamforming;space-time block coding;channel mean feedback;water-filling principle;propagation channel;channel state information;wireless systems;optimal multiantenna transmitter;eigenvectors;correlation matrix;estimated channel;power loading;upper bound;symbol error rate;signal-to-noise ratio;SNR;receiver;orthogonal space-time block codes;two-directional eigen-beamforming;one-directional beamforming;complexity;multiple receive antennas;feedback quality;transmit-power-to-noise ratio;multiantenna diversity;fading channels;rate penalty","","300","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous research provides insufficient evidence to support the idea that the greedy divide-and-conquer algorithm can effectively induce a truly cost-sensitive tree directly from the training data. We provide this empirical evidence in this paper. The algorithm incorporating the instance-weighting method is found to be better than the original algorithm in in of total misclassification costs, the number of high cost errors, and tree size two-class data sets.

By using a feedback linearization scheme, the nonlinear motor model can be linearized in the Brunovski canonical form, and the speed controller can be easily designed based on the linearized model. This technique, however, gives an undesirable output performance under the mismatch of the system parameters and load conditions. An adaptive linearization technique and a sliding-mode control technique have been reported. Although good performance can be obtained, the controller designs are quite complex. To overcome this drawback, the controller parameters are estimated by using a disturbance observer theory where the disturbance torque and flux linkage are estimated. Since only the two reduced-order observers are used for the parameter estimation, the observer designs are considerably simple and the computational load of the controller for parameter estimation is negligibly small. The nonlinear disturbances caused by the incomplete linearization can be effectively compensated by using this control scheme. Thus, a desired dynamic performance and a zero steady-state error can be obtained. The proposed control scheme is implemented on a PM synchronous motor using a digital signal processor (TMS320C31) and the effectiveness is verified through the comparative simulations and experiments.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2002.1005377","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1005377","","Velocity control;Synchronous motors;Sliding mode control;Parameter estimation;Linear feedback control systems;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Linearization techniques;Torque control;Couplings","permanent magnet motors;synchronous motors;machine control;nonlinear control systems;observers;parameter estimation;torque;magnetic flux;angular velocity control;digital signal processing chips;digital control","nonlinear speed control;PM synchronous motor;disturbance estimation;feedback linearization;nonlinear motor model;Brunovski canonical form;speed controller;linearized model;undesirable output performance;load conditions;adaptive linearization technique;sliding-mode control technique;controller designs;controller parameters estimation;disturbance observer theory;disturbance torque;flux linkage;reduced-order observers;computational load;nonlinear disturbances;dynamic performance;zero steady-state error;digital signal processor;TMS320C31;torque estimation;flux estimation;disturbance observers","","111","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, the design is carried out taking into account the total noise produced by the equipment. Thanks to the separation of the noise into the differential mode and the common mode components, it is possible to understand which of the two components is dominant and therefore the filters design can be done straightforwardly by directly measuring the necessary common mode and differential mode attenuation. In this way, it is possible to avoid an expensive and useless heavy filter and satisfy the standards limits only by filtering the dominant component using a smaller, cheaper and optimized filter.

An accurate array performance model based on established testing procedures is required to confidently predict energy available from the array. This model, coupled with the performance characteristics of other balance-of-system components, provides the tool necessary to calculate expected system performance and to compare actual versus expected energy production. Using such a tool, this paper quantifies the effect of the primary factors influencing the DC-energy available from different photovoltaic module technologies, and contrasts these influences with other system-level factors that often result in significantly less AC-energy delivered to the load than the array is capable of providing. Annual as well as seasonal energy production is discussed in the context of both grid-tied and stand-alone photovoltaic systems.","1060-8371","0-7803-7471-1","10.1109/PVSC.2002.1190861","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1190861","","Production systems;Photovoltaic systems;Costs;Solar power generation;Testing;Temperature sensors;Optical losses;Temperature dependence;Laboratories;Monitoring","photovoltaic power systems;solar cell arrays;sunlight;monitoring","photovoltaic systems;annual energy production;long term performance monitoring;available energy prediction;seasonal energy production;grid-tied systems;stand-alone systems;DC energy production;PV modules;solar irradiance","","51","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the relative degree of the regulated output is assumed to be known. Given a smooth reference trajectory, the problem is to design a controller that forces the system measurement to track it with bounded errors. The classical approach requires a state observer. Finding a good observer for an uncertain nonlinear system is not an obvious task. We argue that it is sufficient to build an observer for the output tracking error. Ultimate boundedness of the error signals is shown through Lyapunov's direct method. The theoretical results are illustrated in the design of a controller for a fourth-order nonlinear system of relative degree two and a high-bandwidth attitude command system for a model R-50 helicopter.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2002.804289","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1058077","","Programmable control;Adaptive control;Output feedback;Nonlinear control systems;Control systems;Nonlinear systems;Neural networks;Adaptive systems;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Trajectory","feedback;nonlinear control systems;uncertain systems;adaptive control;neural nets;Lyapunov methods","adaptive output feedback control;uncertain nonlinear systems;single-hidden-layer neural networks;smooth reference trajectory;bounded errors;Lyapunov direct method;model R-50 helicopter","","215","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Each pixel cell contains around 500 transistors and occupies a total surface area of 55 /spl mu/m /spl times/ 55 /spl mu/m. A 20-/spl mu/m wide octagonal opening connects the detector and the preamplifier input via bump bonding. The preamplifier feedback provides compensation for detector leakage current on a pixel by pixel basis. Two identical pulse height discriminators are used to create a pulse if the preamplifier output falls within a defined energy window. These digital pulses are then counted with a 13-b pseudorandom counter. The counter logic, based in a shift register, also behaves as the input-output register for the pixel. Each cell also has an 8-b configuration register which allows masking, test-enabling and 3-b individual threshold adjust for each discriminator. The chip can be configured in serial mode and readout either serially or in parallel. The chip is designed and manufactured in a 6-metal 0.25-/spl mu/m CMOS technology.

A d-q reference frame has been used in this work to model the rectifier behaviour in order to exploit the results obtained in the field of three-phase converters. In this way, a space vector modulation PWM method has been used, with the possibility of using redundant switching states to achieve charge balancing of the capacitors.

These systems are therefore of hybrid type and their modelling is complex. This is why we used the bond graph methodology. The photovoltaic generator is a special source of finite energy with a non-linear current-voltage characteristic. Thus, performances of linear electrical circuits and systems supplied by conventional sources must be re-evaluated when a PV generator is used as energy source. In the first objective of simulation, we use an averaged bond graph model of a photovoltaic system composed of a PV generator coupled to a DC motor-pump through a buck-boost converter. This converter assures a MPPT (maximum power point tracking) behaviour of the system. In the second objective of stability study of the PV system, a direct linearization of the bond graph model is done. The results show a non minimality of phase of the velocity response. So the PV generator voltage is chosen as variable to be controlled in order to assure an MPPT functioning.","1062-922X","0-7803-7437-1","10.1109/ICSMC.2002.1176036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176036","","Bonding;Photovoltaic systems;Power system modeling;Analog-digital conversion;AC machines;Pumps;Fans;Refrigerators;Solar power generation;Character generation","photovoltaic power systems;DC-DC power convertors;DC-AC power convertors;secondary cells","bond graph modelling;DC/AC converters;DC/DC converters;accumulators;nonlinear current-voltage characteristic;maximum power point tracking;photovoltaic system;MPPT buck-boost converter","","4","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typical algorithms for solving this problem operate in a bottom-up, breadth-first search direction. The computation starts from frequent 1-itemsets (the minimum length frequent itemsets) and continues until all maximal (length) frequent itemsets are found. During the execution, every frequent itemset is explicitly considered. Such algorithms perform well when all maximal frequent itemsets are short. However, performance drastically deteriorates when some of the maximal frequent itemsets are long. We present a new algorithm which combines both the bottom-up and the top-down searches. The primary search direction is still bottom-up, but a restricted search is also conducted in the top-down direction. This search is used only for maintaining and updating a new data structure, the maximum frequent candidate set. It is used to prune early candidates that would be normally encountered in the bottom-up search. A very important characteristic of the algorithm is that it does not require explicit examination of every frequent itemset. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm using well-known synthetic benchmark databases, real-life census, and stock market databases.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2002.1000342","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1000342","","Itemsets;Databases;Data mining;Association rules;Data structures;Stock markets","very large databases;data mining;software performance evaluation;tree searching;tree data structures;pattern recognition","Pincer search;large database;maximum frequent set discovery;data mining;association rules;strong rules;episode discovery;knowledge discovery;minimal keys;bottom-up search;breadth-first search;performance evaluation;data structure;benchmark databases;census database;stock market databases","","62","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) PHM concept: Potential impact on aging aircraft problems","A. Hess; L. Fila","NAVAIR Propulsion & Power, Diagnostics, MD, USA; NA","Proceedings, IEEE Aerospace Conference","","2002","6","","6","6","The JSF Autonomic Logistics (AL) system is a new supportability concept that will enable the aircraft to be better utilized throughout the life of the platform, and at a lower cost as compared with legacy aircraft. Autonomic Logistics is, simply put, the automation of the logistics environment such that little human intervention is needed to engage the logistics cycle. Actions that will be automated within the JSF supportability concept include maintenance scheduling, flight scheduling, ordering spare parts, and the like. The cornerstone of Autonomic Logistics is an advanced diagnostic and Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) system. The PHM provides the data, information, and knowledge for initiating the AutoLog chain of events. PHM is the ability of the aircraft to do fault detection (FD), fault isolation (FI), and accommodation real-time on-board the aircraft. Along with this FD/FI capability, some of the other facets of PHM include fault prediction on selected components. parts life usage tracking, fault filtering and reporting, and recommended action to the pilot only when action is necessary. It is intended that in most cases, maintenance actions and lifing decisions will be based on the actual material condition of the equipment components. The proposed architecture of this PHM concept includes a hierarchical approach where data begins at the sensor level and is transported up to area reasoners that turns this data into information about a particular subsystem. From the area reasoner, the information is then passed up to a top level Air Vehicle Reasoner where subsystem information is then fused to give knowledge about the health of the entire air vehicle. Additionally, many of the technologies that are being developed for the JSF PHM suite could be applied to legacy aircraft and would show significant benefits in respect to LCC and maintainability issues. In many cases, the capability of PHM sensors and prognostic technologies will enable the ability to ""see"" incipient faults in subsystem components very early prior to their progressing to final system failure. These capabilities will enable accurate useful life remaining predictions and more aggressive health management of assets. Through very accurate tracking of the life usage data for component parts, the JSF PHM and AL will be able to anticipate many problems that plague current legacy aircraft; giving a lead time to provide fixes before the actual problems become fleet wide and catastrophic. The PHM architecture will directly interface with the Joint Distributed Information System (JDIS), the information system that will enable Autonomic Logistics functions. The JDIS could automatically forward to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) data on problems that arise within the fleet, thus alerting them to a developing situation sooner, and enabling them to provide faster, cheaper fixes to these problems. With these safeguards in place, the JSF will put itself in a position to quickly react to ageing aircraft problems, increase sortie generation rates, decrease mean time to diagnose faults and failures as well as drastically decrease maintenance costs.","","0-7803-7231-X","10.1109/AERO.2002.1036144","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1036144","","Prognostics and health management;Aging;Military aircraft;Logistics;Costs;Vehicles;Aircraft manufacture;Automation;Humans;Fault detection","military aircraft;aircraft maintenance;ageing","Joint Strike Fighter;aircraft aging;autonomic logistics;technologically enabled maintainer;supportability;maintenance scheduling;flight scheduling;diagnostic system;fault detection;fault isolation;prognostics and health management system;joint distributed information system","","40","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A review of existing microscale and mesoscale refrigeration systems revealed that only thermoelectric coolers (TECs) are now commercially available in small sizes. However, existing TECs are limited by their maximum cooling power and low efficiencies. A simple model was constructed to analyze the performance of both existing and predicted future TECs, in an electronic packaging environment. Comparison with the cooling provided by an existing high-performance fan shows that they are most effective for heat loads less than approximately 100 W, but that for higher heat loads, fan air cooling actually yields a lower junction temperature.

The most accurate values of Q/sub 0/ can be obtained by Q-circle fits from multifrequency S-parameter data. Practical measurement systems cause S-parameters of the resonators to be distorted from the circular ideal shape, rotated, and shifted from the origin resulting in errors in the Q-factor values. A novel Q-factor measurement method has been developed based on equations derived for resonators working in the transmission mode and fractional linear circle-fitting techniques. The transmission-mode Q-factor (TMQF) technique removes measurement effects of noise, noncalibrated measurement cables, connectors, coupling structures, crosstalk between the coupling loops, and impedance mismatch from the measurement data. The TMQF is especially useful in cryogenic measurements of high-temperature superconducting thin films and dielectrics since these measurements are typically done in the transmission mode and contain cables and connectors that are difficult to calibrate. The accuracy of the TMQF is better than 1% for practical measurement ranges and the method is applicable to a wide range of coupling.

This stochastic theory should complement nicely the previous theories for the Global Positioning System (GPS) reflected signals from ocean surfaces, especially that of Zavorotny and Voronovich (2000). We quantify the Doppler spread of the reflected signal before interpreting the delay. Our theoretical results compare very well to Doppler spectra computed using data collected during an airborne campaign. The bandwidth of the spectra is linked to the geometry and to the ocean roughness. The bulk of the Doppler spread is caused by the rms slope and not by the surface orbital velocity. Our stochastic theory is generalized to include the delay mapping made possible by the existence of the pseudorandom noise code on the GPS L-band carrier. These results can be seen as a generalization of Woodward's theorem for FM signals to delay-Doppler analysis of more complicated signals. Our formulation is amenable to inversion for the determination of geophysical parameters such as surface wind vector and mean sea level. Another novelty in our approach is the inclusion of the sea state.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2002.1000316","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1000316","","Delay;Signal analysis;Sea surface;Stochastic processes;Oceans;Global Positioning System;Scattering;Bandwidth;Geometry;Rough surfaces","remote sensing by radar;ocean waves;Doppler radar;stochastic processes;Global Positioning System;spaceborne radar;rough surfaces;oceanographic techniques;geophysical signal processing;atmospheric techniques;atmospheric boundary layer;wind","delay-Doppler analysis;bistatically reflected signals;ocean surface;stochastic theory;bistatic scattering;Doppler spread;ocean roughness;rms slope;delay mapping;pseudorandom noise code;Woodward's theorem;surface wind vector;mean sea level;sea state","","65","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

No.02TH8599)","","2002","","","30","30","This contribution presents an extension of the SAGE (space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization) algorithm originally published in Fleury et al. (1999) that allows for joint estimation of the complex weight, the relative delay, the direction (i.e. azimuths and co-elevations) of departure and of incidence, as well as the Doppler frequency of waves propagating from the transmitter to the receiver in mobile radio environments. The scheme is particularly well suited for MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) channel investigations. Its performance, in terms of convergence rate and asymptotic behaviour of the root-mean-square estimation errors, is assessed by means of Monte-Carlo simulations in synthetic time-invariant channels. The results demonstrate rapid convergence (six SAGE iteration cycles) of the root-mean-square estimation errors towards values close to the root of the corresponding Cramer-Rao lower bounds for the ""one-wave"" scenario, even when the waves only slightly differ either in delay, in direction of departure, or in direction of incidence. The SAGE algorithm is also applied to measurement data to assess the propagation constellation in a non-line-of-sight and an obstructed line-of-sight situation. Most of the estimated waves can be easily related to the propagation environments.

It is shown that the product of the time-selectivity order and the frequency-selectivity order is a key parameter to characterize the outage capacity of the correlated fading channel. It is also observed that STCs with large effective lengths and ideal built-in interleavers are more effective in exploiting the natural diversity in multiple-antenna correlated fading channels. We then propose a low-density parity-check (LDPC)-code-based STC-OFDM system. Compared with the conventional space-time trellis code (STTC), the LDPC-based STC can significantly improve the system performance by exploiting both the spatial diversity and the selective-fading diversity in wireless channels. Compared with the previously proposed turbo-code-based STC scheme, LDPC-based STC exhibits lower receiver complexity and more flexible scalability. We also consider receiver design for LDPC-based STC-OFDM systems in unknown fast fading channels and propose a novel turbo receiver employing a maximum a posteriori expectation-maximization (MAP-EM) demodulator and a soft LDPC decoder, which can significantly reduce the error floor in fast fading channels with a modest computational complexity. With such a turbo receiver, the proposed LDPC-based STC-OFDM system is a promising solution to highly efficient data transmission over selective-fading mobile wireless channels.","1558-0857","","10.1109/26.975756","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=975756","","OFDM;Fading;Parity check codes;Frequency division multiplexing;Transmitters;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Convolutional codes;System performance;Turbo codes","error detection codes;turbo codes;modulation coding;OFDM modulation;correlation methods;radio receivers;receiving antennas;transmitting antennas;fading channels;channel capacity;trellis codes;diversity reception;land mobile radio;optimisation;decoding;demodulators;computational complexity;data communication;error statistics","LDPC-based space-time coded OFDM;correlated fading channels;performance analysis;receiver design;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;multiple transmitter antennas;multiple receiver antennas;correlated frequency-selective fading channels;correlated time-selective fading channels;outage capacity;interleavers;multiple-antenna correlated fading channels;low-density parity-check code;LDPC-based STC;system performance;spatial diversity;selective-fading diversity;wireless channels;turbo-code-based STC;receiver complexity;fast fading channels;turbo receiver;maximum a posteriori expectation-maximization;MAP-EM demodulator;soft LDPC decoder;error floor reduction;computational complexity;data transmission;selective-fading mobile wireless channels;pairwise error probability","","179","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The simple imperative programming language is extended with commands (not expressions) for accessing and modifying shared structures, and for explicit allocation and deallocation of storage. Assertions are extended by introducing a ""separating conjunction"" that asserts that its subformulas hold for disjoint parts of the heap, and a closely related ""separating implication"". Coupled with the inductive definition of predicates on abstract data structures, this extension permits the concise and flexible description of structures with controlled sharing.

As a result, the utilization efficiency of the photovoltaic (PV)-module can be increased. In addition, as it doesn't use a digital signal processor (DSP), this MPPT method has the merits of both being cost efficient and having a simple control circuit design.

The protocols exploit spatial diversity available among a collection of distributed terminals that relay messages for one another in such a manner that the destination terminal can average the fading, even though it is unknown a priori which terminals will be involved. In particular, a source initiates transmission to its destination, and many relays potentially receive the transmission. Those terminals that can fully decode the transmission utilize a space-time code to cooperatively relay to the destination. We demonstrate that these protocols achieve full spatial diversity in the number of cooperating terminals, not just the number of decoding relays, and can be used effectively for higher spectral efficiencies than repetition-based schemes. We discuss issues related to space-time code design for these protocols, emphasizing codes that readily allow for appealing distributed versions.","","0-7803-7632-3","10.1109/GLOCOM.2002.1188045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1188045","","Wireless application protocol;Intelligent networks;Wireless networks;Diversity reception;Relays;Decoding;Transmitting antennas;Fading;Space time codes;Interference","protocols;space-time codes;diversity reception;radio networks;decoding;delays;fading channels;multipath channels","distributed space-time coded protocols;exploiting cooperative diversity;multipath fading;multiple protocol layers;wireless network;spatial diversity;distributed terminals;destination terminal;transmission decoding;space-time code;wireless networks;decoding relays;spectral efficiencies;signal fading;multipath propagation","","98","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A second trend is that CPU performance advances are not only brought by increased clock rates, but also by increasing parallelism inside the CPU. Current database systems have not yet adapted to these trends and show poor utilization of both CPU and memory resources on current hardware. In this paper, we show how these resources can be optimized for large joins and translate these insights into guidelines for future database architectures, encompassing data structures, algorithms, cost modeling and implementation. In particular, we discuss how vertically fragmented data structures optimize cache performance on sequential data access. On the algorithmic side, we refine the partitioned hash-join with a new partitioning algorithm called ""radix-cluster"", which is specifically designed to optimize memory access. The performance of this algorithm is quantified using a detailed analytical model that incorporates memory access costs in terms of a limited number of parameters, such as cache sizes and miss penalties. We also present a calibration tool that extracts such parameters automatically from any computer hardware. The accuracy of our models is proven by exhaustive experiments conducted with the Monet database system on three different hardware platforms. Finally, we investigate the effect of implementation techniques that optimize CPU resource usage. Our experiments show that large joins can be accelerated almost an order of magnitude on modern RISC hardware when both memory and CPU resources are optimized.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2002.1019210","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019210","","Hardware;Partitioning algorithms;Database systems;Data structures;Delay;Clocks;Parallel processing;Guidelines;Cost function;Algorithm design and analysis","query processing;optimisation;performance evaluation;database machines;data structures;cache storage","main-memory join optimization;modern hardware;commodity CPU speed;memory latency;CPU performance;clock rate;parallelism;database systems;resource utilization;future database architectures;algorithms;cost modeling;vertically fragmented data structures;cache performance optimization;sequential data access;partitioned hash-join;radix-cluster partitioning algorithm;memory access optimization;algorithm performance;analytical model;memory access costs;cache sizes;miss penalties;calibration tool;automatic parameter extraction;accuracy;Monet database system;hardware platforms;implementation techniques;CPU resource usage optimization;RISC hardware;main-memory databases;query processing;decomposed storage model","","66","","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the increasing number of transistors on a chip, the size of the power network has grown so large as to make the verification task very challenging. The available computational power and memory resources impose limitations on the size of networks that can be analyzed using currently known techniques. Many of today's designs have power networks that are too large to be analyzed in the traditional way as flat networks. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical analysis technique to overcome the aforesaid capacity limitation. We present a new technique for analyzing a power grid using macromodels that are created for a set of partitions of the grid. Efficient numerical techniques for the computation and sparsification of the port admittance matrices of the macromodels are presented. A novel sparsification technique using a 0-1 integer linear programming formulation is proposed to achieve superior sparsification for a specified error. The run-time and memory efficiency of the proposed method are illustrated on industrial designs. It is shown that even for a 60 million-node power grid, our approach allows for an efficient analysis, whereas previous approaches have been unable to handle power grids of such size.","1937-4151","","10.1109/43.980256","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=980256","","Power systems;Power grids;Circuit simulation;Noise robustness;Microprocessors;Integrated circuit interconnections;AC generators;Computer networks;Admittance;Integer linear programming","VLSI;circuit simulation;circuit CAD;linear programming;integer programming;divide and conquer methods;sparse matrices;power supply circuits;microprocessor chips;digital signal processing chips;matrix decomposition","chip power distribution network;reliable performance;verification task;hierarchical analysis technique;capacity limitation;power grid;macromodels;set of partitions;sparsification;port admittance matrices;integer linear programming;memory efficiency;partitioning;signal integrity;circuit simulation;VLSI;robust design;size based complexity;divide and conquer;parallel computation;high performance microprocessors;DSP chips;resistance-inductance-capacitance models;Cholesky factorization;modified nodal equations;computation cost;iterative solver;knapsack problem","","130","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes an improved zero-voltage zero-current switching (ZVZCS) phase-shifted full-bridge (FB) DC/DC converter with a modified energy-recovery snubber (ERS) attached at the secondary side of transformer. Also, the small signal model of the proposed ZVZCS FB DC/DC converter is derived by incorporating the effects introduced by a transformer leakage inductance and an ERS to achieve ZVZCS. Both analysis and experiment are performed to verify the proposed topology by implementing a 7-kW (120 VDC, 58 A) 30-kHz insulated-gate-bipolar-transistor-based experimental circuit.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2002.803237","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1036807","","Pulse width modulation;Pulse width modulation converters;DC-DC power converters;Snubbers;Power transformer insulation;Zero voltage switching;Stress;Zero current switching;Inductance;Performance analysis","DC-DC power convertors;PWM power convertors;switching circuits;bridge circuits;power transformers;power semiconductor switches;power bipolar transistors;insulated gate bipolar transistors;bipolar transistor switches;transformer windings;snubbers","ZVZCS PWM FB DC/DC power converter;modified energy-recovery snubber;zero-voltage zero-current switching;circulating current flows;transformer devices;switching devices;small signal model;transformer leakage inductance;insulated gate bipolar transistor;7 kW;120 V;58 A;30 kHz","","69","","4","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For the treatment of ADHD, medication and cognitive-behavior therapy has been applied in recent years. Although psychostimulant medication has been widely used for many years, current findings suggest that, as the sole treatment for ADHD, it is an inadequate form of intervention, in that parents don't want their child to use drugs and the effects are limited to the period in which the drugs are physiologically active. On the other hand, EEG biofeedback treatment studies for ADHD have reported promising results not only in significant reductions in hyperactive, inattentive and disruptive behaviors, but also in improvements in academic performance and IQ scores. However, it is too boring for children to finish the whole treatment. The recent increase in computer usage in medicine and rehabilitation has changed the way health care is delivered. Virtual reality (VR) technology provides specific stimuli that can be used in removing distractions and in providing environments that get the subjects' attention and increase their ability to concentrate, and VR technology can hold a patient's attention for a longer period of time than other methods, because VR is immersive, interactive and imaginary. Based on these aspects, we developed the Attention Enhancement System (AES) using VR technology and EEG biofeedback for assessing and treating ADHD children as well as increasing the attention span of children who have attention difficulties.","1087-8270","0-7695-1492-8","10.1109/VR.2002.996518","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=996518","","Virtual reality;Electroencephalography;Biological control systems;Medical treatment;Biomedical imaging;Pediatrics;Psychology;Drugs;Medical services;Space technology","virtual reality;electroencephalography;feedback;patient treatment;patient rehabilitation;behavioural sciences computing;medical signal processing","Attention Enhancement System;virtual reality;EEG biofeedback;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;ADHD children;childhood syndrome;attention span;impulsiveness;hyperactivity;learning disabilities;behavioral problems;patient treatment;psychostimulant medication;cognitive-behavior therapy;drugs;inattentiveness;disruptive behaviors;academic performance;IQ scores;rehabilitation;health care delivery;distractions;concentration ability;immersive interactive technology","","19","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Tools are now available that measure test-coverage in terms of blocks, branches, computation-uses, predicate-uses, etc. that are covered. This paper models the relations among testing time, coverage, and reliability. An LE (logarithmic-exponential) model is presented that relates testing effort to test coverage (block, branch, computation-use, or predicate-use). The model is based on the hypothesis that the enumerable elements (like branches or blocks) for any coverage measure have various probabilities of being exercised; just like defects have various probabilities of being encountered. This model allows relating a test-coverage measure directly with defect-coverage. The model is fitted to 4 data-sets for programs with real defects. In the model, defect coverage can predict the time to next failure. The LE model can eliminate variables like test-application strategy from consideration. It is suitable for high reliability applications where automatic (or manual) test generation is used to cover enumerables which have not yet been tested. The data-sets used suggest the potential of the proposed model. The model is simple and easily explained, and thus can be suitable for industrial use. The LE model is based on the time-based logarithmic software-reliability growth model. It considers that: at 100% coverage for a given enumerable, all defects might not yet have been found.","1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2002.804489","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1044339","","Software reliability;Software testing;Predictive models;Automatic testing;Computerized monitoring;NASA;Space technology;Computer science;Sun;Knee","software reliability;program testing;probability","software test-coverage measures;software reliability growth;software testing;blocks;branches;computation-uses;predicate-uses;testing time;logarithmic-exponential model;testing effort;probabilities;defect-coverage;program data-sets;time to next failure prediction;high reliability;automatic test generation;manual test generation","","110","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Centre, La Spezia, Italy; NA","IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","","2002","27","1","35","46","The use of active sonar in shallow water results in received echoes that may be considerably spread in time compared to the resolution of the transmitted waveform. The duration and structure of the spreading and the time of occurrence of the received echo are unknown without accurate knowledge of the environment and a priori information on the location and reflection properties of the target. A sequential detector based on the Page test is proposed for the detection of time-spread active sonar echoes. The detector also provides estimates of the starting and stopping times of the received echo. This signal segmentation is crucial to allow further processing such as more accurate range and bearing localization, depth localization, or classification. The detector is designed to exploit the time spreading of the received echo and is tuned as a function of range to the expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as determined by the transmitted signal power, transmission loss, approximate target strength, and the estimated noise background level. The theoretical false alarm and detection performance of the proposed detector, the standard Page test, and the conventional thresholded matched filter detector are compared as a function of range, echo duration, SNR, and the mismatch between the actual and assumed SNR. The proposed detector and the standard Page test are seen to perform better than the conventional thresholded matched filter detector as soon as the received echo is minimally spread in time. The use of the proposed detector and the standard Page test in active sonar is illustrated with reverberation data containing target-like echoes from geological features, where it was seen that the proposed detector was able to suppress reverberation generated false alarms that were detected by the standard Page test.","1558-1691","","10.1109/48.989883","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=989883","","Sonar detection;Testing;Detectors;Signal to noise ratio;Matched filters;Reverberation;Reflection;Sequential analysis;Signal processing;Signal design","sonar detection;time series;array signal processing;probability","active sonar detection;shallow water;Page test;false alarm performance;received echoes;time-spread active sonar echoes;sequential detector;signal segmentation;time spreading;expected signal-to-noise ratio;reverberation data;target-like echoes;geological features;sonar signal detection;log-likelihood ratio;array sensor data;time series","","47","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The algorithm consists of three distinct levels, i.e., pixel level, region level and frame level. At the pixel level, statistical models of gradients and color are separately used to classify each pixel as belonging to background or foreground. In the region level, foreground pixels obtained from the color based subtraction are grouped into regions and gradient based subtraction is then used to make inferences about the validity of these regions. Pixel based models are updated based on decisions made at the region level. Finally, frame level analysis is performed to detect global illumination changes. Our method provides the solution to some of the common problems that are not addressed by most background subtraction algorithms, such as fast illumination changes, repositioning of static background objects, and initialization of background model with moving objects present in the scene.","","0-7695-1860-5","10.1109/MOTION.2002.1182209","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1182209","","Robustness;Lighting;Layout;Pixel;Object detection;Surveillance;Computer vision;Computer science;Performance analysis;Inference algorithms","image colour analysis;surveillance;gradient methods;statistical analysis;object detection","robust background subtraction;color information;gradient information;pixel level;region level;frame level;statistical models;global illumination changes;moving objects;automated surveillance systems;object detection","","195","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main inductor current is kept in continuous conduction mode (CCM) with small ripple, which allows high output power and small filter parameters.

By nullifying the oscillating components of instantaneous power at the poles of the converter instead of the front-end through solving a set of nonlinear control equations in real time, the harmonics in the output DC voltage can be eliminated more effectively under generalized unbalanced operating conditions on the AC input side. The control scheme allows the PWM rectifier to generate a DC output without substantial even-order harmonics and to maintain nearly unity power factor under generalized unbalanced operating conditions, which makes it possible to reduce the size of the DC-link capacitor and AC inductors leading to the possibility of reduced total cost.

This approach, called the conditional particle filter, tracks a large distribution of person locations conditioned upon a smaller distribution of robot poses over time. This method is robust to sensor noise, occlusion, and uncertainty in robot localization. In fact, conditional particle filters can accurately track people in situations with global uncertainty over robot pose. The number of samples required by this filter scales linearly with the number of people being tracked, making the algorithm feasible to implement in real-time in environments with large numbers of people.

There are a number of issues that can limit the installed capacity of embedded generators; these are often voltage related and the most common is steady-state voltage rise. A number of techniques can be applied to limit steady-state voltage rise, some of which are static in time (e.g., network re-inforcement) and some dynamic (e.g., power factor control). This paper discusses the issue of excess steady-state voltage rise and the methods of limitation that can be applied with specific reference to wind generation.

To construct the FDO, two parameter tuning methods are proposed and shown to be useful in adjusting the parameters of the FDO. The first tuning method employs the disturbance observation error to guarantee that the FDO monitors the unknown disturbance. The next one enlarges the concept of error and introduces augmented error to guarantee that the FDO monitors the disturbance and the control objective is achieved. In addition, the relationships between the suggested FDO-based control and the conventional adaptive fuzzy controls reported in the previous literatures are discussed and it is shown in a rigorous manner that the disturbance observation error or the augmented error converges to a region of which size can be kept arbitrarily small. Finally, some examples and computer simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and the applicability of the FDO.","1941-0034","","10.1109/91.983280","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=983280","","Fuzzy control;Error correction;Computer errors;Fuzzy systems;Nonlinear control systems;Control systems;Nonlinear systems;Size control;Programmable control;Adaptive control","fuzzy control;nonlinear control systems;observers","fuzzy disturbance observer;fuzzy control;FDO;nonlinear system control;internal disturbances;external disturbances;disturbance observation error;adaptive fuzzy controls;disturbance observation error convergence;augmented error convergence","","149","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There are two general approaches to flat panel detector technology: 1) direct and 2) indirect conversion. The present paper outlines the operating principles for direct-conversion detectors based on the use of photoconductors. It formulates and reviews the required X-ray photoconductor properties for such applications and examines to what extent potential materials fulfill these requirements.

It is shown that the symmetries in the PWM waveforms generated can be preserved in the overmodulation zone also. With any given overmodulation algorithm, the voltage control characteristics (i.e., fundamental voltage versus control variable) are found to vary with PWM strategy, pulse number and type of clamping. The inverse of the appropriate voltage control curve is used during premodulation to maintain the modulator gain constant. The differences in the nature of the voltage control characteristics with the different overmodulation algorithms are brought out. These characteristics are compared and contrasted against those at high switching frequencies. The harmonic distortion in the different cases is evaluated and compared. It is shown that the bus clamping strategies perform better than the conventional strategy with any given overmodulation algorithm employed. These strategies, which exploit the flexibilities in the space vector approach, are useful in high power drives on account of their superior waveform quality at low switching frequencies and high DC bus utilization.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2002.802190","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1035155","","Space vector pulse width modulation;Pulse width modulation inverters;Pulse width modulation;Switching frequency;Frequency synchronization;Voltage control;Clamps;Harmonic distortion;Pulse inverters;Drives","PWM invertors;induction motor drives;harmonic distortion;power conversion harmonics;voltage control;switching circuits","induction motor drives;inverters;overmodulation;pulse-width modulation;space vector;voltage control;low switching frequencies;overmodulation algorithms;PWM waveforms;voltage control characteristics;control variable;pulse number;clamping;voltage control curve;high switching frequencies;harmonic distortion;high DC bus utilization","","34","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, these converters have the same characteristics as a conventional matrix converter, such as four-quadrant operation, unity input power factor, no DC-link capacitor, and high quality voltage/current waveforms. Second, the number of switches can be reduced thus reducing the cost. Third, the switches on the line side can turn on and off at zero current, they do not have any difficult commutation problems. Lastly, the complexity of the clamp circuit in these topologies can be greatly simplified thereby further reducing the cost.

John Pescatore, Internet security research director at market-research firm Gartner Inc., said open source security tools now represent 3 to 5 percent of security-software usage but could comprise 10 to 15 percent by 2007. A key factor in this potential growth is the quality of numerous open source security packages. Open source software products include free tools that users can download from the Internet, packages that come with commercial vendor support, and tools bundled with closed source products. The most popular tools include Netfilter and iptables; intrusion-detection systems such as Snort, Snare, and Tripwire; vulnerability scanners like Nessus and Saint; authentication servers such as Kerberos; and firewalls like T.Rex.

The solution of such a design problem, then, can be carried out in a very straightforward way by applying Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization.

"A comparative study of carrier-frequency modulation techniques for conducted EMI suppression in PWM converters","K. K. Tse; Henry Shu-Hung Chung; S. Y. Ron Hui; H. C.

CFM techniques dither the switching period with a small amplitude variation around the nominal value, so that the harmonic power is redistributed over the spectrum of concern. Two types of dithering signals, including the periodic and random signals, are investigated in this paper. The operational characteristics as well as the input and output power spectra of the converters with the two modulating signals are compared. In particular, their characteristics in the low- and high-frequency harmonic power redistribution will be depicted. It is shown that random CFM (RCFM) gives a more effective way to disperse the harmonics around the switching frequency than the periodic CFM (PCFM) with the same frequency deviation. However, RCFM introduces higher low-frequency harmonics than the PCFM at the converter output. Furthermore, effects of the resolution filter bandwidth in the electromagnetic compatibility analyzer on conducted EMI measurement is discussed. The validity of the analyses is confirmed experimentally by using a dc/dc buck converter operating in continuous conduction mode.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2002.1005389","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1005389","","Power harmonic filters;Electromagnetic interference;Pulse modulation;Power system harmonics;Mathematical analysis;EMP radiation effects;Pulse width modulation converters;Power generation;Dispersion;Switching frequency","PWM power convertors;DC-DC power convertors;electromagnetic interference;electromagnetic compatibility;switching circuits;power conversion harmonics;harmonic distortion","PWM power converters;conducted EMI suppression;carrier-frequency modulation techniques;switching period;dithering signals;operational characteristics;harmonic power redistribution;switching frequency;electromagnetic compatibility;resolution filter bandwidth;DC/DC buck power converter;continuous conduction mode","","93","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"From Boolean to probabilistic Boolean networks as models of genetic regulatory networks","I. Shmulevich; E. R.

It also paves the way toward the development of systematic approaches for effective therapeutic intervention in disease. The central theme in this paper is the Boolean formalism as a building block for modeling complex, large-scale, and dynamical networks of genetic interactions. We discuss the goals of modeling genetic networks as well as the data requirements. The Boolean formalism is justified from several points of view. We then introduce Boolean networks and discuss their relationships to nonlinear digital filters. The role of Boolean networks in understanding cell differentiation and cellular functional states is discussed. The inference of Boolean networks from real gene expression data is considered from the viewpoints of computational learning theory and nonlinear signal processing, touching on computational complexity of learning and robustness. Then, a discussion of the need to handle uncertainty in a probabilistic framework is presented, leading to an introduction of probabilistic Boolean networks and their relationships to Markov chains. Methods for quantifying the influence of genes on other genes are presented. The general question of the potential effect of individual genes on the global dynamical network behavior is considered using stochastic perturbation analysis. This discussion then leads into the problem of target identification for therapeutic intervention via the development of several computational tools based on first-passage times in Markov chains. Examples from biology are presented throughout the paper.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2002.804686","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1046956","","Genetics;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Biological systems;Systematics;Diseases;Large-scale systems;Digital filters;Cellular networks;Gene expression","genetics;physiological models;computational complexity;Markov processes;Boolean functions;probability","cellular functional states;cell differentiation;computational complexity;target identification problem;stochastic perturbation analysis;therapeutic intervention;nonlinear digital filters;genes influence quantification;learning;robustness;first-passage times;disease","","330","","102","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark","IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","","2002","11","3","293","305","This paper describes two- and multiset canonical correlations analysis (CCA) for data fusion, multisource, multiset, or multitemporal exploratory data analysis. These techniques transform multivariate multiset data into new orthogonal variables called canonical variates (CVs) which, when applied in remote sensing, exhibit ever-decreasing similarity (as expressed by correlation measures) over sets consisting of (1) spectral variables at fixed points in time (R-mode analysis), or (2) temporal variables with fixed wavelengths (T-mode analysis). The CVs are invariant to linear and affine transformations of the original variables within sets which means, for example, that the R-mode CVs are insensitive to changes over time in offset and gain in a measuring device. In a case study, CVs are calculated from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data with six spectral bands over six consecutive years. Both Rand T-mode CVs clearly exhibit the desired characteristic: they show maximum similarity for the low-order canonical variates and minimum similarity for the high-order canonical variates. These characteristics are seen both visually and in objective measures. The results from the multiset CCA R- and T-mode analyses are very different. This difference is ascribed to the noise structure in the data. The CCA methods are related to partial least squares (PLS) methods. This paper very briefly describes multiset CCA-based multiset PLS. Also, the CCA methods can be applied as multivariate extensions to empirical orthogonal functions (EOF) techniques. Multiset CCA is well-suited for inclusion in geographical information systems (GIS).","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.988962","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=988962","","Remote sensing;Data analysis;Least squares methods;Wavelength measurement;Satellites;Geophysical measurements;Constraint optimization;Time measurement;Information systems;Geographic Information Systems","remote sensing;sensor fusion;correlation methods;least squares approximations;geographic information systems;vegetation mapping;image processing","multiset canonical correlations analysis;data fusion;remote sensing data;two-set canonical correlations analysis;multisource data analysis;multitemporal data analysis;exploratory data analysis;multivariate multiset data;orthogonal variables;canonical variates;correlation measures;R-mode analysis;spectral variables;temporal variables;T-mode analysis;Landsat TM data;maximum similarity variates;minimum similarity variates;partial least squares methods;empirical orthogonal functions;geographical information systems;GIS;Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper;forest region","","153","","48","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These concepts include automated container terminals based on the use of automated guidance vehicles (AGVs), a linear motor conveyance system (LMCS), an overhead grid rail system (GR), and a high-rise automated storage and retrieval structure (AS/RS). We use future demand scenarios to design the characteristics of each terminal in terms of configuration, equipment and operations. A microscopic simulation model is developed and used to simulate each terminal system for the same operational scenario and evaluate its performance. A cost model is used to evaluate the cost associated with each terminal concept. Our results indicate that automation could improve the performance of conventional terminals substantially and at a much lower cost.

"Nash equilibria in competitive societies, with applications to facility location, traffic routing and auctions","A. Vetta","McGill Univ., Montreal, Que., Canada","The 43rd Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 2002. Proceedings.","","2002","","","416","425","We consider the following class of problems. The value of an outcome to a society is measured via a submodular utility function (submodularity has a natural economic interpretation: decreasing marginal utility). Decisions, however, are controlled by non-cooperative agents who seek to maximise their own private utility. We present, under basic assumptions, guarantees on the social performance of Nash equilibria. For submodular utility functions, any Nash equilibrium gives an expected social utility within a factor 2 of optimal, subject to a function-dependent additive term. For non-decreasing, submodular utility functions, any Nash equilibrium gives an expected social utility within a factor 1+/spl delta/ of optimal, where 0/spl les//spl delta//spl les/1 is a number based upon discrete curvature of the function. A condition under which all sets of social and private utility functions induce pure strategy Nash equilibria is presented. The case in which agents themselves make use of approximation algorithms in decision making is discussed and performance guarantees given. Finally we present specific problems that fall into our framework. These include competitive versions of the facility location problem and k-median problem, a maximisation version of the traffic routing problem studied by Roughgarden and Tardos (2000), and multiple-item auctions.","0272-5428","0-7695-1822-2","10.1109/SFCS.2002.1181966","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1181966","","Routing;Game theory;Nash equilibrium;Approximation algorithms;Costs;Measurement standards;Decision making;Internet;Gold;Societies","facility location;game theory;decision making;computational complexity;network routing;competitive algorithms","Nash equilibria;competitive societies;facility location;traffic routing;submodular utility function;outcome value;decreasing marginal utility;noncooperative agents;social performance guarantees;expected social utility;function-dependent additive term;discrete curvature function;private utility functions;social utility functions;approximation algorithms;decision making;performance guarantees;k-median problem;maximisation;multiple-item auctions","","118","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The IEEE 802.11 standard is the most mature technology for wireless local area networks (WLANs). The performance of the medium access control (MAC) layer, which consists of distributed coordination function (DCF) and point coordination function (PCF), has been examined over the past years. We present an analytical model to compute the saturated throughput of 802.11 protocol in the absence of hidden stations and transmission errors. A throughput analysis is carried out in order to study the performance of 802.11 DCF. Using the analytical model, we develop a frame delay analysis under traffic conditions that correspond to the maximum load that the network can support in stable conditions. The behaviour of the exponential backoff algorithm used in 802.11 is also examined.","","0-7803-7686-2","10.1109/IWNA.2002.1241355","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1241355","","Throughput;Delay;Access protocols;Wireless LAN;Analytical models;Local area networks;Media Access Protocol;Error analysis;Performance analysis;Telecommunication traffic","IEEE standards;mobile communication;wireless LAN;error statistics;delay estimation;access protocols;telecommunication traffic","IEEE 802.11 protocol;wireless local area networks;WLAN;medium access control layer;distributed coordination function;point coordination function;transmission error;throughput analysis;frame delay analysis;network traffic condition","","61","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a small circular polarized patch antenna for GPS satellite receivers is investigated. Patch antenna miniaturization can be achieved by adding a slit or slot on the patch element of the antenna. The current path on the patch element increases, and resonant frequency drops by adding the slit. We first investigate the case of a square patch antenna with 4 slits from both sides of the patch. By changing the parameter of the slit structure, an optimum slit parameter for antenna miniaturization is proposed. Then, in order to achieve more miniaturization, a patch antenna with cross-shaped slit is simulated. Parameter optimization is carried out. Finally, the antenna axial ratio is investigated, and an optimum small circular polarized antenna is proposed. A high performance three-dimensional FDTD algorithm using a nonuniform mesh that allows flexible cell size to improve the accuracy of modeling and reduce the computational resources is adopted in this study.","","0-7803-7330-8","10.1109/APS.2002.1016336","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1016336","","Polarization;Patch antennas;Global Positioning System;Costs;Satellites;Slot antennas;Resonant frequency;Computational modeling;Finite difference methods;Time domain analysis","microstrip antennas;finite difference time-domain analysis;electromagnetic wave polarisation;Global Positioning System;mobile antennas;optimisation;antenna radiation patterns","circular polarized patch antenna;antenna axial ratio;high performance FDTD algorithm;three-dimensional FDTD algorithm;nonuniform mesh;flexible cell size;modeling accuracy;cross-shaped slit;GPS;Global Positioning System;Japan;satellite receivers;patch antenna miniaturization;parameter optimization","","3","","4","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We show the exponential law with a constant voltage-acceleration factor violates the widely accepted fundamental breakdown property of Poisson random statistics while the voltage-dependent voltage acceleration described by an empirical power-law relation preserves this well-known property. The apparent thickness-dependence of voltage acceleration factors measured in different voltage ranges can be nicely understood and unified with these independent experimental results in the scenario of a voltage-driven breakdown.

Proceedings (Cat. No.02CH37289)","","2002","3","","1305","1310 vol.3","This study deals with power MOSFET models. Parasitic capacitances are one of the main parameters for dynamic models, and have a critical influence on switching waveforms and switching losses. Most classical models consider that these capacitances are only mono-voltage dependent, but these models do not take into account the two (drain and gate) voltage influences on parasitic capacitances values, and consequently on switching behavior. Therefore simulation results have not been properly estimated, especially for switching losses. This aspect may appear critical for driver design or integration perspectives. Moreover, manufacturers' datasheets offer a description of these capacitances out of nominal operation; this kind of data is not sufficient to build an accurate dynamic model of the component. In this paper, we show the inadequacy of this kind of model, by referring to a physical structure analysis of charge locations during switching transitions. Next, the article presents a new insight based on this approach. Firstly, we describe the analytical equations ruling this model with respect to critical voltage changes. After an experimental parameter extraction under nominal operation, our empirical model is established and implanted in the PSPICE simulator. Its topology allows the modeling of both voltages-depending nonlinear capacitances to be taken into account. The complete model is tested on components from various manufacturers, and results are compared with experimental curves. This model appears to be more accurate and more reliable than PSPICE or manufacturer original models. Consequently, this accuracy in switching waveforms is invaluable for driver design. It improves switching losses and EMI predictions, and could be used for optimizing the design of drive circuit (e.g. in applications such as integrated functions). This aspect appears greatly valuable for manufacturers.","","0-7803-7262-X","10.1109/PSEC.2002.1022357","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1022357","","MOSFET circuits;Power MOSFET;Parasitic capacitance;Switching loss;Voltage;Virtual manufacturing;SPICE;Nonlinear equations;Parameter extraction;Topology","power MOSFET;switching circuits;capacitance;SPICE;field effect transistor switches;losses;driver circuits","power MOSFET models;power MOSFET switching waveforms;parasitic capacitances;switching waveforms;switching losses;mono-voltage dependent capacitances;gate voltage;drain voltage;datasheets;charge locations;switching transitions;critical voltage changes;parameter extraction;nominal operation;PSPICE simulator;nonlinear capacitances;PSPICE;driver design;EMI predictions;drive circuit design optimisation;integrated functions","","28","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The goal is the minimization of the RMS and THD values of the line current, controlling the firing angle value of the TCR branch. Some changes in the conventional architecture of the conventional FC-TCR compensator were necessary to achieve it. We show that substitution of the reactor by a switched tapped-reactor forces the thyristor-firing angle to be small, improving the power factor (PF) and the total harmonic distortion of the line current (THDI). We denote this new architecture as 'fixed capacitor-thyristor switched reactor-thyristor controlled reactor' (FC-TSR-TCR). In the case of nonsinusoidal voltage supply, the above quantities, PF and THDI, are remarkably improved by substituting fixed capacitor by a fixed LC serial branch (FLC-TSR-TCR). These changes are also effective with nonlinear loads. For simulation purposes, FC-TSR-TCR and FLC-TSR-TCR compensator models, and linear and nonlinear loads, represented respectively by RL circuits and ideal current sources, have been considered. For several illustrative cases, an optimization algorithm is applied in each half-cycle of the voltage source, and optimum values of firing angles are obtained satisfying condition of minimum rms value of the line current.

A common measure of the attained diagonalization of the set is the weighted least-squares (WLS) criterion. However, most well-known algorithms are restricted to finding an orthogonal diagonalizing matrix, relying on a whitening phase for the nonorthogonal factor. Often, such an approach implies unbalanced weighting, which can result in degraded performance. We propose an iterative alternating-directions algorithm for minimizing the WLS criterion with respect to a general (not necessarily orthogonal) diagonalizing matrix. Under some mild assumptions, we prove weak convergence in the sense that the norm of parameters update is guaranteed to fall below any arbitrarily small threshold within a finite number of iterations. We distinguish between Hermitian and symmetrical problems. Using BSS simulations results, we demonstrate the improvement in estimating the mixing matrix, resulting from the relaxation of the orthogonality restriction.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2002.1011195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1011195","","Source separation;Independent component analysis;Blind source separation;Symmetric matrices;Matrix decomposition;Least squares approximation;Iterative algorithms;Degradation;Convergence;Instruments","signal processing;least squares approximations;matrix algebra;convergence of numerical methods;minimisation;iterative methods","nonorthogonal joint diagonalization;approximate joint diagonalization;minimization algorithm;blind source separation algorithms;weighted least-squares;orthogonal diagonalizing matrix;whitening phase;nonorthogonal factor;unbalanced weighting;iterative alternating-directions algorithm;weak convergence;parameters update;Hermitian problems;symmetrical problems;simulations results;mixing matrix estimation","","280","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The noise analysis also shows that the theoretical noise-equivalent temperature difference (NETD) of the system can be below 3 mK.","1941-0158","","10.1109/84.993448","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=993448","","Infrared imaging;Optical noise;Optical imaging;Gold;Optical devices;Image resolution;Image analysis;Optical device fabrication;Pixel;Silicon","infrared imaging;focal planes;microsensors;micro-optics;CCD image sensors","uncooled micro-optomechanical infrared imaging system;focal plane array;silicon nitride/gold bi-material cantilever pixels;infrared absorber;thermomechanical transducer;wave optics;microfabrication;visible optical readout system;beam deflection;CCD imager;noise equivalent temperature difference;SiN-Au","","153","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since then, there have been many fundamental advances in the theory as well as applications of these learning models. In the past few years, the structure of LA, has been modified in several directions to suit different applications. Concepts such as parameterized learning automata (PLA), generalized learning,automata (GLA), and continuous action-set learning automata (CALA) have been proposed, analyzed, and applied to solve many significant learning problems. Furthermore, groups of LA forming teams and feedforward networks have been shown to converge to desired solutions under appropriate learning algorithms. Modules of LA have been used for parallel operation with consequent increase in speed of convergence. All of these concepts and results are relatively new and are scattered in technical literature. An attempt has been made in this paper to bring together the main ideas involved in a unified framework and provide pointers to relevant references.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2002.1049606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1049606","","Learning automata;Programmable logic arrays;Convergence;Learning systems;Scattering;Stochastic processes;Books;Pattern recognition;Automatic control","learning automata;bibliographies;reviews","parameterized learning automata;generalized learning automata;learning problems;feedforward networks;continuous action-set learning automata","","237","","60","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The thoroughgoing approach to business continuity planning (BCP) that I present-called the BCP cycle-can help you avoid those pitfalls.

This study further examines the effects on supply chain performance in electronic commerce. Specifically, the multiagent simulation system Swarm is employed to simulate and analyze the buyer-seller correlation in sharing information among business partners in supply chains. Our findings indicate that the more detailed information shared between firms, the lower the total cost, the higher the order fulfillment rate, and the shorter the order cycle time. In other words, information sharing may reduce the demand uncertainty that firms normally encounter. Firms that share information between trading partners tend to transact with a reduced number of suppliers.

This duality allows the joint downlink optimization problem to be solved efficiently by considering the equivalent uplink problem instead, which is easier to handle. In this paper we characterize the interference scenarios and noise levels for which the SINR requirements can be supported for a given power constraint. Moreover, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for duality.

Before performing an addition operation, the effective dynamic ranges of two input data are determined. Based on a larger effective dynamic range, only selected functional blocks of the adder are activated to generate the desired result while the input bits of the unused functional blocks remain in their previous states. The added result is then recovered to match the required word length. Using this approach to reduce switching operations of noneffective bits allows input data in 2's complement and sign magnitude representations to have similar switching activities. This investigation thus proposes a 2's complement adder with two master-stage and slave-stage flip-flops, a dynamic-range determination unit and a sign-extension unit, owing to the easy implementation of addition and subtraction in such a system. Furthermore, this adder has a minimum number of transistors addressed by carry-in bits and thus is designed to reduce the power consumption of its unused functional blocks. The dynamic range and sign-extension units are explored in detail to minimize their circuit area and power consumption. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed 32-bit adder can reduce power dissipation of conventional low-power adders for practical multimedia applications. Besides the ripple adder, the proposed approach can be utilized in other adder cells, such as carry lookahead and carry-select adders, to compromise complexity, speed and power consumption for application-specific integrated circuits and digital signal processors.","1557-9999","","10.1109/TVLSI.2003.809138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1177341","","Dynamic range;Adders;Energy consumption;Digital signal processors;Signal design;Digital arithmetic;Master-slave;Flip-flops;Circuits;Power dissipation","low-power electronics;adders;digital arithmetic;logic partitioning;flip-flops;application specific integrated circuits;digital signal processing chips;circuit optimisation;CMOS logic circuits","low-power adder;effective dynamic data ranges;power-efficient digital signal processor;fundamental arithmetic unit;addition operation;adder functional blocks;word length matching;sign magnitude representations;switching activities;2's complement adder;master-stage flip-flops;slave-stage flip-flops;dynamic-range determination unit;sign-extension unit;power consumption reduction;circuit area minimization;32-bit adder;power dissipation;multimedia applications;ripple adder;carry lookahead adders;carry-select adders;application-specific integrated circuits;CMOS technology;32 bit","","17","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Diversity can be obtained over time (interleaving of coded bits), frequency (combining of multipaths in CDMA systems) and space (multiple antennas). The basic idea is to improve performance by creating several independent signal paths between the transmitter and the receiver. In this paper, we propose a scheme that induces random fading when the environment has little scattering and/or the fading is slow. We focus on the downlink of a cellular system. We use multiple antennas at the base-station to transmit the same signal from each antenna modulated by a gain whose phase and magnitude is changing in time in a controlled but pseudo random fashion.","","0-7803-7501-7","10.1109/ISIT.2002.1023721","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1023721","","Array signal processing;Fading;Diversity reception;Transmitting antennas;Interleaved codes;Frequency diversity;Multiaccess communication;Transmitters;Scattering;Downlink","fading channels;transmitting antennas;cellular radio;diversity reception","opportunistic beamforming;dumb antennas;wireless channels;frequency diversity;time diversity;space diversity;random fading;downlink;cellular system;multiple antennas;transmit antennas","","122","","3","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The radii of the cations Lu/sup 3+/ and Y/sup 3+/ differ by only 5%, therefore, one can substitute yttrium for lutetium without changing the structure. The addition of yttrium has several advantages: the raw material Y/sub 2/O/sub 3/ is much cheaper than Lu/sub 2/O/sub 3/ and the melting point is up to 100/spl deg/C less. Since yttrium has a much lower atomic number and atomic mass than lutetium, LYSO crystals have a lower density and effective atomic number. This means that LYSO does not absorb X-rays as well as LSO. LYSO with 50% lutetium, however, has an effective atomic number that is just 11% less than LSO and the light yield of LYSO with 30% or more lutetium is roughly the same as that of LSO samples.

The effect of stress temperature and voltage on Weibull slopes is investigated over a wide range of voltage and temperatures for several different oxide thickness values. It was found that Weibull slopes show a strong thickness dependence while Weibull slopes are essentially independent of stress conditions such as voltages and temperature. The implications of the voltage-independent Weibull slope on voltage-dependent acceleration factors are discussed. In addition, the impact of electron injection polarity on Weibull slopes is studied in detail. To further advance understanding, we compare the measured Weibull slopes with different nitrogen incorporation processes under gate injection mode. It was found that for ultrathin oxides below 3 nm to the first order, the Weibull slopes are relatively insensitive to the nitrogen incorporation process for which we investigated.

The geometrical model consists of a rectangular parallelepiped whose vertical walls form a generic angle with respect to the sensor line of flight. The parallelepiped is placed on a rough surface. The radar return from such a structure can be decomposed into single-scattering contributions from the (rough) ground, the building roof (a plane surface in our model), and vertical walls and multiple scattering contributions from dihedral structures formed by vertical walls and ground. In our model, single-scattering contributions are evaluated by using either physical optics (PO) or geometrical optics (GO), depending on surface roughness. In order to account for multiple scattering between buildings and terrain, we use GO to evaluate the field reflected by the smooth wall toward the ground (first bounce) or the sensor (second or third bounce) and GO or PO (according to ground surface roughness) to evaluate the field scattered by the ground toward the wall (first or second bounce) or the sensor (second bounce).

This paper describes the development of a novel prosthetic hand based on a ""biomechatronic"" design. The proposed hand is designed to augment the dexterity of traditional prosthetic hands while maintaining approximately the same dimension and weight.

In this study, the authors attempt to integrate these two areas of inquiry and explore the possibilities to predict diffusion patterns based on characteristics of the innovation and the adopting entities. Based on a cross-sectional sample of 313 large American firms, 20 information technology (IT) innovations were examined and their diffusion patterns assessed with respect to models that espoused internal and external influence. The mixed influence model (Bass model) was chosen as a robust common representation for the set of diffusion patterns. However, the external influence as represented by the coefficient of innovation was found to be extremely small and the internal influence dominates for all innovations. The other two parameters of the model, the saturation level and the coefficient of imitation, which represents internal influence, were then used to perform a cluster analysis. Five clusters of technologies emerged, and the potential relationships between their innovation characteristics and diffusion patterns were explored. Rigorous examination of these potential relationships by future researchers may result in practical methods for predicting patterns of IT innovation diffusion based on innovation and technology characteristics.","1558-0040","","10.1109/17.985744","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=985744","","Research and development management","research and development management;product development;information technology;pattern clustering;statistical analysis","information technology innovations;diffusion patterns;innovation characteristics;relative advantage;complexity;mathematical models;USA;mixed influence model;Bass model;saturation level;coefficient of imitation;cluster analysis;R&D management","","113","","60","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, a three-dimensional (3D) acoustic vector sensor produces four time series outputs, which can be processed to provide some degree of spatial filtering and a direction of arrival (DoA) estimate to an acoustic target. Historically, two-dimensional (2D) acoustic vector sensors have been used in several Navy systems, like the DIFAR sonobuoy (AN/SQQ-53 series) and the AN/WLR-9 acoustic intercept receiver (which uses the multimode hydrophone). These devices have made important contributions to the Navy sonar community, where it is desirable to obtain an accurate azimuthal DoA estimate for bearing to a low-frequency target from a single point in space. Other researchers have used the outputs of acoustic vector sensor to estimate intensity vector (watts/m/sup 2/). In the literature, these intensity-related vector sensors have been referred to as intensity probes or ""acoustic watt-meters"". In this paper, we consider 3D acoustic vector sensors that uses three orthogonal underwater acoustic accelerometers with a scalar acoustic pressure sensor of hydrophone packaged in a single housing. The sensors will be referred to as low-frequency vector sensors since they were optimized for the 50 Hz to 2 kHz band. We will show that these vector sensors can produce a frequency-independent spatial response over the aforementioned band. Specifically, a 3-dB beamwidth of 105 degrees across the stated frequency band and an array gain against isotropic noise of 6 dB can be achieved. We will also show that the four time series vector sensor outputs (x, y and z accelerations and 1 pressure) can be processed to produce multiple nulls in the spatial response or beam pattern, which can be used to null out interfering noise sources. Experimental results, recorded at the US Navy Seneca Lake Test Facility, Dresden, NY using two different designs of the aforementioned 3D vector sensor, show how vector sensors perform in the presence of multiple low-frequency sources and interferers.","","0-7803-7534-3","10.1109/OCEANS.2002.1191918","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1191918","","Acoustic sensors;Acoustic devices;Underwater acoustics;Direction of arrival estimation;Acoustic measurements;Pressure measurement;Sonar equipment;Frequency;Low-frequency noise;Filtering","sensors;acoustic devices;acoustic signal detection;underwater sound;oceanographic equipment","low-frequency acoustic vector sensors;acoustic pressure gradient;3D acoustic vector sensor;time series outputs;spatial filtering;direction of arrival;acoustic target;2D acoustic vector sensors;Navy systems;DIFAR sonobuoy;AN/SQQ-53 series;AN/WLR-9;acoustic intercept receiver;multimode hydrophone;Navy sonar community;azimuthal DoA estimate;low-frequency target;intensity-related vector sensors;intensity probes;acoustic watt-meters;orthogonal underwater acoustic accelerometers;scalar acoustic pressure sensor;frequency-independent spatial response;array gain;isotropic noise;beam pattern;interfering noise sources;US Navy Seneca Lake Test Facility;Dresden;50 to 2000 Hz;6 dB","","24","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two-dimensional and three-dimensional computer modeling for a real 268 MVA, 525/17.75 kV three-legged step up transformer was employed. The results show that inrush current peaks of 70% of the rated short circuit current cause local forces in the same order of magnitude as those at short circuit. The resulting force summed up over the high voltage coil is even three times higher. Although inrush currents normally are smaller, the forces can have similar amplitudes as those at short circuit however with longer exposure time. Therefore, care has to be taken to avoid such high inrush currents. Today controlled switching offers an elegant and practical solution.","1937-4208","","10.1109/61.974203","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=974203","","Stress;Power transformers;Coils;Surge protection;Power transformer insulation;Short circuit currents;Electromagnetic forces;Costs;Circuit faults;Conductors","power transformers;transformer windings;power system transients;finite element analysis;coils;short-circuit currents;power engineering computing;electromagnetic forces;switching;electromagnetic fields","inrush currents impact;high-voltage power transformer coils;mechanical stress;failure experience;mechanical forces;computer modeling;three-legged step up transformer;inrush current peaks;short circuit current;controlled switching;electromagnetic forces;finite element method;268 MVA;525 kV;17.75 kV","","97","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this problem, the number of sources impinging on an array of sensors is to be estimated. The common approach for solving this problem is to use an information theoretic criterion like the minimum description length (MDL), or the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Although it has been gaining much popularity and has been used in a variety of problems, the performance of information theoretic criteria-based estimators for the unknown number of sources has not been sufficiently studied, yet. In the context of array processing, the performance of such estimators were analyzed only for the special case of Gaussian sources where no prior knowledge of the array structure, if given, is used. Based on the theory of misspecified models, this paper presents a general asymptotic analysis of the performance of any information theoretic criterion-based estimator, and especially of the MDL estimator. In particular, the performance of the MDL estimator, which assumes Gaussian sources and structured array when applied to Gaussian sources, is analyzed. In addition, it is shown that the performance of a certain MDL estimator is not very sensitive to the actual distribution of the source signals. However, appropriate use of prior knowledge about the array geometry can lead to significant improvement in the performance of the MDL estimator. Simulation results show a good fit between the empirical and the theoretical results.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.995060","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=995060","","Signal detection;Performance analysis;Sensor arrays;Vectors;Estimation theory;Direction of arrival estimation;Array signal processing;Information analysis;Geometry;Narrowband","signal detection;array signal processing;information theory;parameter estimation;Gaussian processes;probability","signal detection;general asymptotic performance analysis;array processing;Gaussian sources;array structure;misspecified models;MDL estimator;source signals distribution;simulation results;sensors array;minimum description length;Akaike information criterion;misdetection probability;information theoretic criteria-based estimators","","97","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The MANETs being considered in this paper are characterized by unpredictable mobility, multi-hop communication, and no clock synchronization mechanism. In particular, the last characteristic would complicate the problem since a host has to predict when another host will wake up to receive packets. We propose three power management protocols, namely dominating-awake-interval, periodically-fully-awake-interval, and quorum-based protocols, which are directly applicable to IEEE 802.11-based MANETs. As far as we know, the power management problem for multi-hop MANETs has not been seriously addressed in the literature.

Through measurement of the phase flux linkages and phase currents the neural network is able to estimate the rotor position, thereby facilitating elimination of the rotor position sensor. The ANN training data set is comprised of magnetization data for the SRM with flux linkage (/spl lambda/) and current (i) as inputs and the corresponding position (/spl theta/) as output in this set.

This incorporates monolithic, hybrid, surface mount and wirebond technology. However, a close examination of the applications in motor drives and power supplies indicates that there has been no dramatic volume reduction of the subsystem. The power semiconductor modules have shrunk the power switching part of the converter, but the bulk of the subsystem volume still comprises the associated control, sensing, electromagnetic power passives and interconnect structures. The paper addresses the improvement of power processing technology through advanced integration of power electronics. The goal of a subsystem in a module necessitates this advanced integration. The central philosophy of this technology development research is to advance the state of the art by providing the concept of integrated power electronics modules (IPEMs).

We then propose a hybrid adaptive (HA) law for adjusting the parameters. The HA law utilizes two types of errors in the adaptive system, the tracking error and the modeling error. Performance analysis using a Lyapunov synthesis approach proves the superiority of the HA law over the direct adaptive (DA) method in terms of faster and improved tracking and parameter convergence. Furthermore, this is achieved at negligible increased implementation cost or computational complexity. We prove a theorem that shows the properties of this hybrid adaptive fuzzy control system, i.e., bounds for the integral of the squared errors, and the conditions under which these errors converge asymptotically to zero are obtained.

By nullifying the oscillating components of instantaneous power at the poles of the converter instead of the front-end through solving a set of nonlinear control equations in real time, the harmonics in the output DC voltage can be eliminated more effectively under generalized unbalanced operating conditions in the ac input side. The control scheme allows the pwm rectifier to generate a DC output without substantial even-order harmonics and to maintain nearly unity power factor under generalized unbalanced operating conditions, which makes it possible to reduce the size of the DC-link capacitor and AC inductors leading to reduced total cost.

The rotor speed can then be derived from the sliding mode functions and the estimated flux.

In this technique a model for simulating a two-winding-single-phase transformer is modified to be suitable for simulating an internal fault in one of the windings. The transformer is represented by three-windings in this case; one winding is the healthy winding, while the other two represent the faulty windings. Three differential equations representing these windings are simulated and solved using MATLAB/SIMULINK. Simulation results include inrush magnetizing current and internal fault current. A fast Fourier transform (FFT) is used to analyze the simulated currents, and it shows that the second harmonic component of the internal fault current is not predominant which agrees with transformer theories.","","0-7803-7527-0","10.1109/MELECON.2002.1014563","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1014563","","Mathematical model;MATLAB;Circuit faults;Phase transformers;Power system modeling;Computational modeling;Power system simulation;Couplings;Differential equations;Fault currents","power transformers;fault diagnosis;power engineering computing;transformer windings;electrical faults;fast Fourier transforms;magnetisation","transformer internal faults modeling;two-winding-single-phase transformer;internal fault simulation;faulty windings;MATLAB/SIMULINK;inrush magnetizing current;internal fault current;fast Fourier transform;FFT;simulated currents analysis;second harmonic component","","10","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For any given bit rate and intra refreshing rate, this model is capable of estimating the corresponding coding distortion even before a video frame is coded. We then present a theoretical analysis of the picture distortion caused by channel errors and the subsequent inter-frame propagation. Based on this analysis, we develop a statistical model to estimate such channel errors induced distortion for different channel conditions and encoder settings. The proposed analytic model mathematically describes the complex behavior of channel errors in a video coding and transmission system. Unlike other experimental approaches for distortion estimation reported in the literature, this analytic model has very low computational complexity and implementation cost, which are highly desirable in wireless video applications. Simulation results show that this model is able to accurately estimate the channel errors induced distortion with a minimum delay in processing. Based on the proposed source coding R-D model and the analytic channel-distortion estimation, we derive an analytic solution for adaptive intra mode selection and joint source-channel rate control under time-varying wireless channel conditions.

Then, a recovery algorithm is applied for reconstructing a license plate if the plate is fragmented into several parts. The last step is to do license plate verification. The morphology based method can significantly reduce the number of candidates extracted from the cluttered images and thus speeds up the subsequent plate recognition.

IEEE","","2002","2","","344","351 vol.2","Eye tracking is one of the key technologies for future driver assistance systems since human eyes contain much information about the driver's condition such as gaze, attention level, and fatigue level. Thus, nonintrusive methods for eye detection and tracking are important for many applications of vision-based driver-automotive interaction. One problem common to many eye tracking methods proposed so far is their sensitivity to lighting condition change. This tends to significantly limit their scope for automotive applications. In this paper we present a new realtime eye detection and tracking method that works under variable and realistic lighting conditions. By combining imaging by using IR light and appearance-based object recognition techniques, our method can robustly track eyes even when the pupils are not very bright due to significant external illumination interferences. The appearance model is incorporated in both eye detection and tracking via the use of a support vector machine and mean shift tracking. Our experimental results show the feasibility of our approach and the validity for the method is extended for drivers wearing sunglasses.","","0-7803-7346-4","10.1109/IVS.2002.1187975","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1187975","","Eyes;Humans;Fatigue;Automotive applications;Optical imaging;Object recognition;Robustness;Lighting;Interference;Support vector machines","driver information systems;object recognition;Kalman filters;computer vision","real-time eye detection;driver observation;eye tracking;driver assistance systems;gaze;attention level;fatigue level;vision-based driver-automotive interaction;IR light;appearance-based object recognition;appearance model;Kalman filtering","","11","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When the distance of the blood vessel was 5 mm from the nearest distal electrode 1) in the 3-D model, the maximum tissue temperature (hot spot) appeared next to electrode A. The location of the hot spot was adjacent to another electrode 2) on the opposite side when the blood vessel was 1 mm from electrode A.

This paper describes performance control of a Web server using classical feedback control theory. We use feedback control theory to achieve overload protection, performance guarantees, and service differentiation in the presence of load unpredictability. We show that feedback control theory offers a promising analytic foundation for providing service differentiation and performance guarantees. We demonstrate how a general Web server may be modeled for purposes of performance control, present the equivalents of sensors and actuators, formulate a simple feedback loop, describe how it can leverage on real-time scheduling and feedback-control theories to achieve per-class response-time and throughput guarantees, and evaluate the efficacy of the scheme on an experimental testbed using the most popular Web server, Apache.

Inevitably, the role of quantitative image analysis in the evaluation of drug therapy will increase, driven in part by requirements imposed by regulatory agencies. However, the prohibitive length of time involved and the significant intra- and inter-rater variability of the measurements obtained from manual analysis of large MRI databases represent major obstacles to the wider application of quantitative MRI analysis. We have developed a fully automatic ""pipeline"" image analysis framework and have successfully applied it to a number of large-scale, multi-center studies (more than 1000 MRI scans). This pipeline system is based on robust image processing algorithms, executed in a parallel, distributed fashion. This paper describes the application of this system to the automatic quantification of multiple sclerosis lesion load in MRI, in the context of a phase III clinical trial. The pipeline results were evaluated through an extensive validation study, revealing that the obtained lesion measurements are statistically indistinguishable from those obtained by trained human observers. Given that intra- and inter-rater measurement variability is eliminated by automatic analysis, this system enhances the ability to detect small treatment effects not readily detectable through conventional analysis techniques. While useful for clinical trial analysis in multiple sclerosis, this system holds widespread potential for applications in other neurological disorders, as well as for the study of neurobiology in general.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2002.806283","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174106","","Pipelines;Magnetic resonance imaging;Clinical trials;Multiple sclerosis;Image analysis;Magnetic analysis;Humans;Lesions;Pathology;Drugs","image segmentation;biomedical MRI;medical image processing;diseases","automatic pipeline analysis;tissue quantification;3-D MRI data;magnetic resonance imaging;medical diagnostic imaging;neurological disorders;drug therapy evaluation;large-scale multicenter studies;clinical trials;neurobiology;inter-rater variability;intra-rater variability;multiple sclerosis","Algorithms;Brain;Clinical Trials as Topic;Computing Methodologies;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Multiple Sclerosis;Multiple Sclerosis;Observer Variation;Systems Integration","493","","58","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Dominating sets and neighbor elimination-based broadcasting algorithms in wireless networks","I. Stojmenovic; M. Seddigh; J. Zunic","DISCA, Univ. Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","","2002","13","1","14","25","In a multihop wireless network, each node has a transmission radius and is able to send a message to all of its neighbors that are located within the radius. In a broadcasting task, a source node sends the same message to all the nodes in the network. In this paper, we propose to significantly reduce or eliminate the communication overhead of a broadcasting task by applying the concept of localized dominating sets. Their maintenance does not require any communication overhead in addition to maintaining positions of neighboring nodes. Retransmissions by only internal nodes in a dominating set is sufficient for reliable broadcasting. Existing dominating sets are improved by using node degrees instead of their ids as primary keys. We also propose to eliminate neighbors that already received the message and rebroadcast only if the list of neighbors that might need the message is nonempty. A retransmission after negative acknowledgements scheme is also described. The important features of the proposed algorithms are their reliability (reaching all nodes in the absence of message collisions), significant rebroadcast savings, and their localized and parameterless behavior. The reduction in communication overhead for the broadcasting task is measured experimentally. Dominating set based broadcasting, enhanced by a neighbor elimination scheme and highest degree key, provides reliable broadcast with /spl les/53 percent of node retransmissions (on random unit graphs with 100 nodes) for all average degrees d. Critical d is around 4, with <48 percent for /spl les/3, /spl les/40 percent for d/spl ges/10, and /spl les/20 percent for d/spl ges/25. The proposed methods are better than existing ones in all considered aspects: reliability, rebroadcast savings, and maintenance communication overhead. In particular, the cluster structure is inefficient for broadcasting because of considerable communication overhead for maintaining the structure and is also inferior in terms of rebroadcast savings.","1558-2183","","10.1109/71.980024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=980024","","Broadcasting;Intelligent networks;Wireless networks","mobile radio;distributed algorithms;telecommunication network reliability;radio broadcasting","multihop wireless network;neighbor elimination-based broadcasting algorithms;transmission radius;message;source node;communication overhead;localized dominating sets;retransmission after negative acknowledgements scheme;reliability;rebroadcast savings;cluster structure;maintenance communication overhead","","493","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To support these applications, it is important to accurately estimate shifts in orientation angles induced by the azimuth slope variations. However, in many cases, inconsistency in the estimation of orientation angle shifts was encountered in several areas, introducing noisy and erroneous results. The present authors develop a unified analysis of estimation algorithms based on the circular polarization covariance matrix. The concept of reflection symmetry is used to explain the soundness of the circular polarization method and to show problems associated with other algorithms.

Syst., Whippany, NJ, USA","Journal of Lightwave Technology","","2002","20","6","986","992","Bononi and Rusch (1998) developed an approach for investigating erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) dynamics based on the one-dimensional ordinary nonlinear differential equation derived by Sun et al. (1996) for the time-dependent population of excited-state erbium atoms in EDFAs. Bononi and Rusch then applied their approach to the investigation of transients (1998). In this paper, we implement the same nonlinear ordinary differential equation as a MATLAB Simulink model and we use harmonic and random-noise inputs to investigate gain modulation, referred to also as overmodulation. This is the low-frequency (/spl sim/kHz) amplitude modulation of the EDFA pump and the communication signal used for propagating line monitoring information [(Freeman and Conradi, 1993), (Murakami et al., 1996), (Shimizu et al., 1993), (Gieske and Bystrowski, 2001)]. Freeman and Conradi (1993) showed that the EDFA transfer function from overmodulated pump to output communication signal was effectively a low-pass filter response. They also showed that the transfer function from overmodulated communication input signal to output signal was effectively a high-pass filter response similar to a lead compensator with one zero followed in frequency by one pole. They developed a numerical model (Freeman and Conradi, 1993) to predict the shape of these transfer functions and compared their predictions with experiment. However, their model was not sufficiently developed in Freeman and Conradi (1993) to be directly applicable to the design of line monitoring systems. Using a Simulink simulation of the nonlinear differential equation due to Sun et al. (1996) and using standard signal processing techniques for calculating the pump-to-signal and signal-to-signal transfer functions, we obtain the low-pass filter response to pump overmodulation and the high-pass filter response to signal overmodulation. We compare our results with experiment for a given set of EDFA parameters (Gieske and Bystrowski, 2001).

"A TSK-type recurrent fuzzy network for dynamic systems processing by neural network and genetic algorithms","Chia-Feng Juang","Dept. of Electr. Eng., Nat. Chung-Hsing Univ., Taichung, Taiwan","IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","","2002","10","2","155","170","In this paper, a TSK-type recurrent fuzzy network (TRFN) structure is proposed. The proposal calls for the design of TRFN by either neural network or genetic algorithms depending on the learning environment. A recurrent fuzzy network is described which develops from a series of recurrent fuzzy if-then rules with TSK-type consequent parts. The recurrent property comes from feeding the internal variables, derived from fuzzy firing strengths, back to both the network input and output layers. In this configuration, each internal variable is responsible for memorizing the temporal history of its corresponding fuzzy rule. The internal variable is also combined with external input variables in each rule's consequence, which shows an increase in network learning ability. TRFN design under different learning environments is next advanced. For problems where supervised training data is directly available, TRFN with supervised learning (TRFN-S) is proposed, and a neural network (NN) learning approach is adopted for TRFN-S design. An online learning algorithm with concurrent structure and parameter learning is proposed. With flexibility of partition in the precondition part, and outcome of TSK-type, the TRFN-S displays both small network size and high learning accuracy. For problems where gradient information for NN learning is costly to obtain or unavailable, like reinforcement learning, TRFN with Genetic learning (TRFN-G) is put forward. The precondition parts of TRFN-G are also partitioned in a flexible way, and all free parameters are designed concurrently by genetic algorithm. Owing to the well-designed network structure of TRFN, TRFN-G, like TRFN-S, is characterized by high learning accuracy. To demonstrate the superior properties of TRFN, TRFN-S is applied to dynamic system identification and TRFN-G to dynamic system control. By comparing the results to other types of recurrent networks and design configurations, the efficiency of TRFN is verified.","1941-0034","","10.1109/91.995118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=995118","","Fuzzy systems;Neural networks;Algorithm design and analysis;Genetic algorithms;Proposals;History;Input variables;Training data;Supervised learning;Partitioning algorithms","fuzzy neural nets;recurrent neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);genetic algorithms;identification;fuzzy control;neurocontrollers","TSK-type recurrent fuzzy network;dynamic systems processing;neural network;genetic algorithms;learning environment;recurrent fuzzy if-then rules;fuzzy firing strengths;network learning ability;supervised training data;online learning algorithm;concurrent structure;parameter learning;reinforcement learning;TRFN with genetic learning;dynamic system identification;dynamic system control","","322","","55","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We show that the capacity C/sub E/ is given by an expression parallel to that for the capacity of a purely classical channel: i.e., the maximum, over channel inputs /spl rho/, of the entropy of the channel input plus the entropy of the channel output minus their joint entropy, the latter being defined as the entropy of an entangled purification of /spl rho/ after half of it has passed through the channel. We calculate entanglement-assisted capacities for two interesting quantum channels, the qubit amplitude damping channel and the bosonic channel with amplification/attenuation and Gaussian noise. We discuss how many independent parameters are required to completely characterize the asymptotic behavior of a general quantum channel, alone or in the presence of ancillary resources such as prior entanglement. In the classical analog of entanglement-assisted communication - communication over a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) between parties who share prior random information - we show that one parameter is sufficient, i.e., that in the presence of prior shared random information, all DMCs of equal capacity can simulate one another with unit asymptotic efficiency.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2002.802612","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1035117","","Information rates;Entropy;Gaussian noise;Protocols;Memoryless systems","quantum communication;channel capacity;entropy;Gaussian noise;protocols;memoryless systems","entanglement-assisted capacity;reverse Shannon theorem;noisy quantum channel;information per channel;shared quantum entanglement;communication protocol;channel entropy;joint entropy;qubit amplitude damping channel;bosonic channel;amplification/attenuation;Gaussian noise;asymptotic behavior;entanglement-assisted communication;discrete memoryless channel;shared random information;asymptotic efficiency","","276","","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The control methods and strategy of the FES system for power quality are introduced in detail. A new rapid method to calculate the amplitude of sinusoidal voltage and current is presented which could improve the performance of the FES system. To realize the high efficiency of the energy conversion and to minimize the torque ripple of the motor/generator, the waveform of the AC power converter output currents is controlled to be sinusoidal by using sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM) control method. During the storage period, the AC power converter accelerates the flywheel storing energy. At the generating times, the AC power converter drives the flywheel to decelerate and then the kinetic energy is transformed into electric energy and returned to power system.

Precision tracking performance of these drives is deteriorated by nonlinear transmission attributes including kinematic error, flexibility, hysteresis and friction. Hence characterization and compensation of these nonlinear attributes is crucial to improve the precision in tracking and regulation. This paper focuses on modeling, identification, and compensation of nonlinear friction in harmonic drives. Harmonic drive friction models presented in the literature are found to be a combination of Coulomb and viscous friction. However, a dynamic friction phenomenon exhibits, in addition to Coulomb and viscous frictions, other nonlinear phenomena including the Dahl effect, and the Stribeck effect which must be considered in an accurate friction model. In addition, in this research, harmonic drive friction is discovered to be dependent on the motor position. Complete characterization of friction in harmonic drives is carried out in this paper by using a recently developed LuGre (Lund-Grenobel) friction model superimposed with a new position-dependent part. Parameters of the proposed model are identified using linear and nonlinear identification tools. Experimental implementation of a friction compensation scheme based on the proposed model demonstrates the effectiveness of the model.","0191-2216","0-7803-7516-5","10.1109/CDC.2002.1184485","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1184485","","Friction;Semiconductor device modeling;Radar tracking;Radar applications;Spaceborne radar;Military satellites;Cameras;Kinematics;Hysteresis;Drives","drives;identification;friction;compensation;force control;tracking;Fourier series","harmonic drives;tracking;kinematic error;Fourier series;identification;Coulomb friction;viscous friction;Dahl effect;Stribeck effect;LuGre friction model;modeling","","25","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The prior is a description of the dynamic behavior we expect for the targets which is modeled as constant velocity motion with a Gaussian disturbance acting on the target's heading direction. The likelihood function is arrived at by defining an uninformative prior for both the signals and noise variance and removing these parameters from the problem by marginalization. Advances in sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) techniques, specifically the particle filter algorithm, allow us to model and track the posterior distribution defined by the Bayesian model using a collection of target states that can be viewed as samples from the posterior of interest.

To develop transformer incipient fault detection technique, a transformer model to simulate internal incipient faults is required. This paper presents a methodology to model internal incipient winding faults in distribution transformers. These models were implemented by combining deteriorating insulation models with an internal short circuit fault model. The internal short circuit fault model was developed using finite element analysis. The deteriorating insulation model, including an aging model and an arcing model connected in parallel, was developed based on the physical behavior of aging insulation and the arcing phenomena occurring when the insulation was severely damaged. The characteristic of the incipient faults from the simulation were compared with those from some potential experimental incipient fault cases.

This approach presents some advantages over previously published methods: it can treat multiple-part structures and requires less restrictive assumptions on the structure's topology. In this paper, we address the problem of building a 3-D statistical shape model of the left and right ventricle of the heart from 3-D magnetic resonance images. The average accuracy in landmark propagation is shown to be below 2.2 mm.

A comparative study of the battery usage and thermal performance of the battery packs used in these two vehicles during chassis dynamometer testing is presented. Specially designed charge and discharge chassis dynamometer test cycles revealed that the Insight limited battery usage to 60% of rated capacity, while the Prius limited battery usage to 40% of the rated capacity. The Prius uses substantially more pack energy over a given driving cycle but at the same time maintains the pack within a tight target state of charge (SOC) of 54% to 56%. The Insight does not appear to force the battery to a specific target SOC. The Prius battery contributes a higher percentage of the power needed for propulsion.

A piezo-electric droplet generator driven by a bipolar voltage signal is used to dispense 50-70 /spl mu/m diameter droplets traveling at 1-3 m/s before impacting a compliant polyimide substrate. The deposit/substrate composite is subsequently processed at 300/spl deg/C for 15 min to allow for complete evaporation of the carrier and for sintering of the nano-particles, thereby yielding a finished circuit interconnect. Test vehicles created using this technique exhibit features as fine as 120 /spl mu/m wide and 1 /spl mu/m thick with resistivities on the order of 3.5/spl times/10/sup -5/ /spl Omega/cm. The circuitry performed well under environmental conditioning. As expected, repeatability of circuitry fabrication showed sensitivity to the generation of steady, satellite-free droplets.

In vibration monitoring, the occurrence of occasional transient disturbances makes the recorded signal nonstationary, especially during the start-up of an engine. Through the wavelet analysis, transients can be decomposed into a series of wavelet components, each of which is a time-domain signal that covers a specific octave frequency band. Disturbances of small extent (duration) are amplified relative to the rest of the signal when projected to similar size wavelet bases and, thus, they can be easily detected in the corresponding frequency band. This paper presents a new method for extracting features in the wavelet domain and uses them for classification of washing machines vibration transient signals. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT), in conjunction with statistical digital signal processing techniques, is used for feature extraction. The Karhunen Loeve transform (KLT) is used for feature reduction and decorrelation of the feature vectors. The Euclidean, Mahalanobis, and Bayesian distance classifiers, the learning vector quantization (LVQ) classifier, and the fuzzy gradient classifier are used for classification of the resulting feature space. Classification results are illustrated and compared for the rising part of vibration velocity signals of a variety of real washing machines with various defects.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2002.1017721","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1017721","","Washing machines;Wavelet analysis;Discrete wavelet transforms;Signal analysis;Transient analysis;Frequency;Feature extraction;Karhunen-Loeve transforms;Monitoring;Engines","domestic appliances;feature extraction;pattern classification;signal classification;discrete wavelet transforms;fault diagnosis;vibration measurement;Bayes methods;neural nets;production testing","washing machines vibration signals;feature extraction;discrete wavelet analysis;nonstationary signal analysis;vibration monitoring;transient disturbances;time-domain signal;octave frequency band;vibration transient signals classification;DWT;statistical digital signal processing techniques;statistical DSP techniques;Karhunen Loeve transform;feature reduction;decorrelation;fuzzy gradient classifier;learning LVQ classifier;learning vector quantization classifier;Euclidean distance classifier;Mahalanobis distance classifier;Bayesian distance classifier;feature space classification;fault diagnosis;pattern recognition;production stage","","63","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the previous framework, a fuzzy connected object is defined with a threshold on the strength of connectedness. We introduce the notion of relative connectedness that overcomes the need for a threshold and that leads to more effective segmentations. The central idea is that an object gets defined in an image because of the presence of other co-objects. Each object is initialized by a seed element. An image element c is considered to belong to that object with respect to whose reference image element c has the highest strength of connectedness. In this fashion, objects compete among each other utilizing fuzzy connectedness to grab membership of image elements. We present a theoretical and algorithmic framework for defining objects via relative connectedness and demonstrate utilizing the theory that the objects defined are independent of reference elements chosen as long as they are not in the fuzzy boundary between objects. An iterative strategy is also introduced wherein the strongest relative connected core parts are first defined and iteratively relaxed to conservatively capture the more fuzzy parts subsequently. Examples from medical imaging are presented to illustrate visually the effectiveness of relative fuzzy connectedness. A quantitative mathematical phantom study involving 160 images is conducted to demonstrate objectively the effectiveness of relative fuzzy connectedness. <br>Disclaimer A claim of priority in research and publication appeared on page 1486 in the paper ""Relative Fuzzy Connectedness and Object Definition: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications in Image Segmentation"" by J.K.

Essentially, antennas employing multiple modes offer characteristics similar to an antenna array, through multiple modes and using only a single element. The physical mechanism that yields different received signals is the fact that each mode has a different radiation pattern. Analytical expressions for the correlation between signals received by different modes are presented for a biconical and a circular microstrip antenna that employs higher order modes. It is found that the correlation is low enough to yield a significant diversity gain. Furthermore, the channel capacity of a MIMO system using a multimode antenna, i.e., an antenna employing multiple modes, is found to be comparable to the capacity of an array. Since only one element is needed, the multimode antenna offers several advantages over traditional arrays, and is an interesting antenna solution for future high capacity MIMO systems.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2002.804856","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1175185","","Channel capacity;MIMO;Microstrip antennas;Receiving antennas;Antenna arrays;Microstrip antenna arrays;Antenna radiation patterns;Transmitting antennas;Mobile antennas;Radio transmitters","MIMO systems;antenna arrays;channel capacity;correlation methods;array signal processing;conical antennas;microstrip antenna arrays;diversity reception;antenna radiation patterns","signals correlation;channel capacity;multimode antennas;diversity branches;multiple input multiple output systems;antenna array;biconical microstrip antenna;circular microstrip antenna;higher order modes;diversity gain;high capacity MIMO systems;received signals;radiation pattern","","69","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This behavior can be explained by reduced transistor gate overdrive and reduced voltage headroom at the circuit level.

The performance properties of the Koch fractal monopole have primarily been attributed to its fractal geometry. Here, the performance properties of the Koch fractal monopole, normal mode helix, and two meander line configurations are considered. While the resonant frequency of these antennas is a function of both the antenna's geometry and total wire length, it is demonstrated that when these antennas are made to be resonant at the same frequency, they essentially exhibit the same performance characteristics independent of the differences in their geometry and total wire length. It is demonstrated that the electromagnetic behavior of the Koch fractal monopole is not uniquely defined by its geometry alone.","1548-5757","","10.1109/LAWP.2002.802550","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1046122","","Resonance;Wire;Geometry;Helical antennas;Resonant frequency;Shape;Bandwidth;Fractal antennas;Filling","monopole antennas;wire antennas;helical antennas;resonance;fractals","resonant properties;wire monopole antennas;Koch fractal monopole antenna;Euclidean monopole;performance properties;fractal geometry;normal mode helix;meander line configurations;resonant frequency;antenna geometry;total wire length;electromagnetic behavior","","68","","2","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We employ an appearance manifold model, but instead of using a densely sampled spline to perform the nearest manifold point query, we retain the original set of sparse appearance samples and use linear interpolation among a small subset of samples to approximate the nearest manifold point. The advantage of this approach is that since we are only storing a sparse set of samples, each sample can be a high dimensional vector that retains more representational accuracy than short vectors produced with dimensionality reduction methods. The algorithm was tested with a set of eye images labelled with ground truth point-of-regard coordinates.

We present a method to provide long-term autonomy by implementing autonomous recharging.

Eight sessions were conducted once a week. During each session, physiology was measured to give an objective measurement of improvement over the course of exposure therapy. In addition, self-report questionnaires, subjective ratings of anxiety (SUDs), and behavioral observations (included here as flying behavior before beginning treatment and at a three-month posttreatment followup) were included.

Our optimality criterion is the reduction of uncertainty in the state estimation process, rather than an estimator-specific metric (e.g., minimum mean squared estimate error). The claim is that state estimation becomes more reliable if the uncertainty and ambiguity in the estimation process can be reduced. We use Shannon's information theory to select information-gathering actions that maximize mutual information, thus optimizing the information that the data conveys about the true state of the system. The technique explicitly takes into account the a priori probabilities governing the computation of the mutual information. Thus, a sequential decision process can be formed by treating the a priori probability at a certain time step in the decision process as the a posteriori probability of the previous time step. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach in an object recognition application using an active camera for sequential gaze control and viewpoint selection.

The model so developed predicts a step-function in the potential along the channel, which ensures screening of the drain potential variation by the gate near the drain. The small difference of voltage due to different gate material keeps a uniform electric field along the channel, which in turn improves the carrier transport efficiency. The ratio of two metal gate lengths can be optimized along with the metal work functions and oxide thickness for reducing the hot electron effect.

Here, we improve on the ""integral equation"" by resorting to a ""differential equation"" approach. The classic glucose kinetics minimal model was used with the addition of a parametric model for the rate of appearance into plasma of oral glucose (Ra). Three behavioral models of Ra were proposed: piecewise-linear (P), spline (S) and dynamic (D). All three models performed satisfactorily allowing a precise estimation of S/sub I/ and a plausible reconstruction of Ra. Mean S/sub I/ estimates were virtually identical: S/sub I//sup P/=6.81/spl plusmn/0.87 (SE); S/sub I//sup S/=6.53/spl plusmn/0.80; and S/sub I//sup D/=6.62/spl plusmn/0.79. S/sub I/ strongly correlated with the integral-equation index (I) S/sub I//sup I/:r=0.99, p<0.01 for models D and S, and r=0.97, p<0.01 for P. Also, S/sub I/ compared well with insulin sensitivity estimated from intravenous glucose tolerance test in the same subjects (r=0.75, p<0.01; r=0.71, p<0.01; r=0.73, p<0.01, respectively, for P, S, and D models versus S/sub I//sup IVGTT/). Finally, the novel approach allows estimation of S/sub I/ from a shorter test (120 min): model P yielded S/sub I//sup R/=7.16/spl plusmn/1.0 (R for reduced) which correlated very well with S/sub I//sup P/ and S/sub I//sup I/ (respectively, r=0.94, p<0.01; r=0.95, p<0.01) and still satisfactorily with S/sub I//sup IVGTT/ (r=0.77, p<0.01).","1558-2531","","10.1109/10.995680","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=995680","","Sugar;Insulin;Testing;Integral equations;Differential equations;Kinetic theory;Parametric statistics;Plasmas;Piecewise linear techniques;Spline","differential equations;piecewise linear techniques;splines (mathematics);biocontrol;parameter estimation;physiological models;organic compounds;biochemistry","oral glucose minimal model;insulin sensitivity;meal test;oral glucose tolerance test;integral equation;differential equation;classic glucose kinetics minimal model;parametric model;plasma;behavioral models;piecewise-linear model;spline model;dynamic model;integral-equation index;intravenous glucose tolerance test;glucose regulatory system","Blood Glucose;Blood Glucose;Computer Simulation;Female;Glucose Tolerance Test;Humans;Insulin;Insulin;Male;Middle Aged;Models, Biological;Nonlinear Dynamics;Reproducibility of Results","123","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A computational scheme that facilitates the local motion vector field to estimate the global disturbing translational and rotational motions is developed. First, the optical flow technique is used to estimate the local motion vector field of the image, yielding the velocity of each pixel in the current image frame. Then, the global translational and rotational motion parameters are determined in terms of the least squares estimation. Finally, these motion vectors are used to generate the counterbalance signals for removing the disturbance motion. Owing to the additional ability of the rotational motion removal, the new DIS system suppresses the undesirable translational and rotational disturbances effectively and thus enhances the DIS performance significantly.","1558-4127","","10.1109/TCE.2002.1010098","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1010098","","Digital images;Image motion analysis;Optical sensors;Cameras;Motion estimation;Fluctuations;Motion detection;Pixel;Least squares approximation;Video sequences","image sequences;motion estimation;least squares approximations;parameter estimation","digital image;translational motion stabilization;rotational motion stabilization;optical flow;local motion vector field;motion estimation;least squares estimation;parameter estimation","","102","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In wireless communication, the server-to-client (downlink) communication bandwidth is much higher than the client-to-server (uplink) communication bandwidth. This asymmetry makes the dissemination of data to client machines a desirable approach. However, dissemination of data by broadcasting may induce high access latency in case the number of broadcast data items is large. We propose two methods aiming to reduce client access latency of broadcast data. Our methods are based on analyzing the broadcast history (i.e., the chronological sequence of items that have been requested by clients) using data mining techniques. With the first method, the data items in the broadcast disk are organized in such a way that the items requested subsequently are placed close to each other. The second method focuses on improving the cache hit ratio to be able to decrease the access latency. It enables clients to prefetch the data from the broadcast disk based on the rules extracted from previous data request patterns. The proposed methods are implemented on a Web log to estimate their effectiveness. It is shown through performance experiments that the proposed rule-based methods are effective in improving the system performance in terms of the average latency as well as the cache hit ratio of mobile clients.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2002.1047775","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1047775","","Data mining;Broadcasting;Mobile computing;Delay;Wireless communication;Mobile communication;Bandwidth;Downlink;History;Prefetching","mobile computing;storage management;wireless LAN;client-server systems;data mining;cache storage;software performance evaluation;distributed databases","data mining;broadcasting data;mobile computing;wireless communication devices;server-client communication bandwidth;client-server communication bandwidth;access latency;cache hit ratio;prefetching;Web log;performance experiments;rule-based methods;mobile clients","","25","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

No.02CH37309)","","2002","1","","666","671 vol.1","Steady state analysis techniques use linear phasor circuit models, but power flow calculations require the solution of nonlinear algebraic equations. Small-signal linear models form the basis of solution algorithms such as the Newton-Raphson method and decoupled load flows. Since linear models are attractive from the viewpoint of gaining significant insight into system behavior under different operating scenarios, large-signal models such as 'DC models' are commonly employed. Results obtained from linear models are approximate, but they provide easy comparison between different operating conditions. Contingency ranking using a DC model, and generation shift and line outage distribution factors is highly satisfactory in many instances. Studies requiring steady state analysis such as security analysis, optimal power flow and economic dispatch, and voltage stability can significantly reduce computational burdens by assuming linear models. The main objective of this paper is to study quantitatively the relative merits of commonly used linear models in steady state power system analysis. The 'DC model' assumes negligible resistances and flat voltage profiles, and relates the bus phase angles to real power injections. A new linear model which accounts for the voltage and reactive power flows is developed, and compared to the results from 'DC model' and 'small-signal' models. The figure of merit for comparison is taken as the root mean square difference of similar quantities such as bus voltages and line active and reactive flows. IEEE 14-bus is used for the testing. Results show significant potential for the new linear model.","","0-7803-7322-7","10.1109/PESW.2002.985087","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=985087","","Power system modeling;Steady-state;Load flow analysis;Power system analysis computing;Voltage;Load flow;Power system security;Power system stability;Circuits;Nonlinear equations","power system analysis computing;load flow;transmission network calculations;linear algebra","power system steady-state load flow analysis;nonlinear algebraic equations;Newton-Raphson method;decoupled load flows;DC models;contingency ranking;generation shift;line outage distribution factors;security analysis;optimal power flow;economic dispatch;voltage stability;flat voltage profiles;bus phase angles;real power injections;computer simulation","","5","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the special cage rotor construction and substantial rotor losses is one of the key deficiencies of these machines. A similar and extremely interesting machine, the brushless doubly fed reluctance machine (BDFRM), has been largely ignored in comparison. This was mainly due to the fact that reluctance rotor designs were not capable of generating saliency ratios large enough to make the BDFRM competitive with other machines. However, developments in reluctance rotors, spurred on by research into synchronous reluctance machines, have resulted in high-saliency-ratio cageless rotors that are economical to build. This, together with the promise of higher efficiency and simpler control compared to the BDFIM, means that further investigation of the BDFRM is warranted. This paper presents a comparative theoretical analysis and aspects of practical implementation of the important control strategies and associated machine performance/inverter size tradeoffs for the BDFRM in the light of its most likely applications-large-pump-type adjustable-speed drives and variable-speed constant-frequency wind power generation systems.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2002.804749","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1058104","","Reluctance machines;Pumps;Wind turbines;Rotors;Inverters;Induction machines;Reluctance generators;Power generation economics;Performance analysis;Size control","reluctance generators;reluctance motor drives;variable speed drives;wind turbines;pumps;brushless machines;machine control;rotors","doubly fed reluctance machines;large pumps;wind turbines;self-cascade machine;reluctance machine;brushless doubly fed machine;electric machine control;partially rated inverter;limited speed variations;brushless doubly fed reluctance machine;reluctance rotors;synchronous reluctance machines;high-saliency-ratio cageless rotors;higher efficiency;control;pump-type adjustable-speed drives;variable-speed constant-frequency wind power generation systems;10 kW","","95","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We have used the surface-tension-induced motion of a mercury drop in a microchannel filled with an electrolyte as actuation energy for the micropump. This allows low voltage operation as well as low-power consumption. The micropump is composed of a stack of three wafers bonded together. The microchannel is formed on a glass wafer using SU-8 and is filled with electrolyte where the mercury drop is inserted. The movement of the mercury pushes or drags the electrolyte, resulting in the deflection of a membrane that is formed on the second silicon wafer. Another silicon wafer, which has passive check valves and holes, is stacked on the membrane wafer, forming inlet and outlet chambers. Finally, these two chambers are connected through a silicone tube forming the complete micropump.

No.02CH37283)","","2002","","","283","286","A closed-loop DC motor control system is developed using National Instrument's (NI) data acquisition (DAQ) board (Model MIO 6040E), LabVIEW software package, and DAQ signal accessory board for smooth and accurate positioning. The motor can be rotated either clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW) as needed. A linear feedback that employs a potentiometer provides the current position of the motor. The LabVIEW software is used to develop a virtual instrument (VI) that includes a front panel and a functional diagram. The VI reads the desired position of the motor entered by the user on the front panel and the current motor position via feedback, and determines its amount and direction of rotation. A smooth cubic polynomial that is continuous and has a continuous first and second derivative is utilized to represent the angular position of the motor. The VI uses the polynomial to generate a velocity profile which in turn is converted into a voltage profile for the motor armature through a conversion formula. This conversion formula is determined through the use of motor speed-voltage characteristics obtained from laboratory experiments. Reading the motor position and sending voltage to the motor circuit are accomplished via the DAQ's input and output ports respectively. The system is tested in the laboratory for different angular displacements and initial positions of the motor. Initial results are found to be satisfactory. This initiative is a preliminary work towards the development of a control system of one of the Radio Telescopes (called Smiley) at Pisgah Astronomical Research Institute (PARI) in Rosman, North Carolina.","","0-7803-7252-2","10.1109/SECON.2002.995606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=995606","","Position control;DC motors;Data acquisition;Instruments;Feedback;Polynomials;Voltage;Laboratories;Control system synthesis;Software packages","radiotelescopes;physical instrumentation control;machine control;data acquisition;feedback;virtual instrumentation;polynomials;DC motors;closed loop systems;position control","Smiley;closed-loop DC motor control system;National Instrument;data acquisition board;LabVIEW software package;signal accessory board;clockwise rotation;linear feedback;potentiometer;motor position;feedback;cubic polynomial;continuous first derivative;continuous second derivative;angular position;velocity profile generation;motor armature;conversion formula;motor speed-voltage characteristics;angular displacements;Pisgah Astronomical Research Institute;Rosman;North Carolina;counterclockwise rotation","","2","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The weaknesses of classical watermarking methods to geometrical distortions are outlined first. Geometrical distortions can be decomposed into two classes: global transformations such as rotations and translations and local transformations such as the StirMark attack. An overview of existing self-synchronizing schemes is then presented. Theses schemes can use periodical properties of the mark, invariant properties of transforms, template insertion, or information provided by the original image to counter geometrical distortions. Thereafter, a new class of watermarking schemes using the image content is presented. We propose an embedding and detection scheme where the mark is bound with a content descriptor defined by salient points. Three different types of feature points are studied and their robustness to geometrical transformations is evaluated to develop an enhanced detector. The embedding of the signature is done by extracting feature points of the image and performing a Delaunay tessellation on the set of points. The mark is embedded using a classical additive scheme inside each triangle of the tessellation. The detection is done using correlation properties on the different triangles. The performance of the presented scheme is evaluated after JPEG compression, geometrical attack and transformations. Results show that the fact that the scheme is robust to these different manipulations. Finally, in our concluding remarks, we analyze the different perspectives of such content-based watermarking scheme.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2002.801587","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1036050","","Watermarking;Robustness;Detectors;Digital images;Counting circuits;Feature extraction;Additives;Transform coding;Image coding;Home computing","copy protection;image coding;feature extraction;image recognition;data encapsulation;transforms;mesh generation","geometrically invariant watermarking;feature points;digital images;geometrical distortions;global transformations;rotations;translations;local transformations;StirMark attack;self-synchronizing schemes;periodical properties;invariant properties;transforms;template insertion;image content;embedding;detection scheme;content descriptor;feature extraction;Delaunay tessellation;additive scheme;correlation properties;JPEG compression;geometrical attack","","317","","42","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In contrast to the existing results in the literature, a key feature of our adaptive regulator is its minimum-order property, namely, no matter how big the number of unknown parameters is, the order of the dynamic compensator is identical to one, and is therefore minimal.

This assumption leads to sluggish rejection of most real unmeasured disturbances since these disturbances generally enter the loop through state or input channels. An improved performance is often possible by designing an unmeasured disturbance model that explicitly incorporates input and state disturbance effects. A Kalman filter can then be employed to estimate the disturbances, allowing the control algorithm to reject them more quickly. This paper presents design guidelines for a disturbance model that accommodates unmeasured disturbances entering through the process input, state, or output. Conditions that guarantee detectability of the augmented system model are provided.

The first part of the analysis details how clients at these institutions interact with the wide-area domain name system, focusing on client-perceived performance and the prevalence of failures and errors. The second part evaluates the effectiveness of DNS caching. In the most recent MIT trace, 23% of lookups receive no answer; these lookups account for more than half of all traced DNS packets since query packets are retransmitted overly persistently. About 13% of all lookups result in an answer that indicates an error condition. Many of these errors appear to be caused by missing inverse (IP-to-name) mappings or NS records that point to nonexistent or inappropriate hosts. 27% of the queries sent to the root name servers result in such errors. The paper also presents the results of trace-driven simulations that explore the effect of varying time-to-live (TTL) and varying degrees of cache sharing on DNS cache hit rates. Due to the heavy-tailed nature of name accesses, reducing the TTL of address (A) records to as low as a few hundred seconds has little adverse effect on hit rates, and little benefit is obtained from sharing a forwarding DNS cache among more than 10 or 20 clients. These results suggest that client latency is not as dependent on aggressive caching as is commonly believed, and that the widespread use of dynamic low-TTL A-record bindings should not greatly increase DNS related wide-area network traffic.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2002.803905","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1041066","","Domain Name System;Internet;Delay;Telecommunication traffic;Wide area networks;Network servers;Computer science;IP networks;Space technology;Bandwidth","cache storage;performance evaluation;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;Internet;client-server systems","DNS performance;caching;domain name system;TCP traffic;Internet links;MIT Laboratory for Computer Science;Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology;client-perceived performance;failures;lookups;query packets;error condition;inverse mappings;IP-to-name mappings;NS records;root name servers;trace-driven simulations;client latency;wide-area network;time to live;hit rates","","123","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The worst-case performance is compared for two cases: (1) with the use of feedback alone and (2) with the addition of the feedforward input. It is shown that inversion-based feedforward controllers can lead to performance improvements at frequencies w where the uncertainty /spl Delta/ (jw) in the nominal plant is smaller than the size of the nominal plant G/sub 0/(jw) divided by its condition number K/sub G0/ (jw), i.e., /spl par//spl Delta/(jw)/spl par//sub 2/ < /spl par/G/sub 0/(jw) /spl par//sub 2//k/sub G0/ (jw).

Registered real and virtual endoscopic images (perspective volume renderings generated from the same view as the endoscope camera using a preoperative image) are displayed simultaneously; when combined with the ability to vary tissue transparency in the virtual images, this provides surgeons with the ability to see beyond visible surfaces and, thus, provides additional exposure during surgery. A mount with four photoreflective spheres is rigidly attached to the endoscope and its position and orientation is tracked using an optical position sensor. Generation of virtual images that are accurately registered to the real endoscopic images requires calibration of the tracked endoscope. The calibration process determines intrinsic parameters (that represent the projection of three-dimensional points onto the two-dimensional endoscope camera imaging plane) and extrinsic parameters (that represent the transformation from the coordinate system of the tracker mount attached to the endoscope to the coordinate system of the endoscope camera), and determines radial lens distortion. The calibration routine is fast, automatic, accurate and reliable, and is insensitive to rotational orientation of the endoscope. The routine automatically detects, localizes, and identifies dots in a video image snapshot of the calibration target grid and determines the calibration parameters from the sets of known physical coordinates and localized image coordinates of the target grid dots. Using nonlinear lens-distortion correction, which can be performed at real-time rates (30 frames per second), the mean projection error is less than 0.5 mm at distances up to 25 mm from the endoscope tip, and less than 1.0 mm up to 45 mm. Experimental measurements and point-based registration error theory show that the tracking error is about 0.5-0.7 mm at the tip of the endoscope and less than 0.9 mm for all points in the field of view of the endoscope camera at a distance of up to 65 mm from the tip.

Two examples of clinical applications are presented to illustrate the usefulness of image-enhanced endoscopy.

In developing a successful SVM forecaster, feature extraction is the first important step. This paper proposes the applications of principal component analysis (PCA), kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) to SVM for feature extraction. PCA linearly transforms the original inputs into uncorrelated features. KPCA is a nonlinear PCA developed by using the kernel method. In ICA, the original inputs are linearly transformed into statistically independent features. By examining the sunspot data and one real futures contract, the experiment shows that SVM by feature extraction using PCA, KPCA or ICA can perform better than that without feature extraction. Furthermore, there is better generalization performance in KPCA and ICA feature extraction than PCA feature extraction.","","981-04-7524-1","10.1109/ICONIP.2002.1198211","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1198211","","Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Principal component analysis;Independent component analysis;Contracts;Risk management;High performance computing;Upper bound;Quadratic programming;Training data","feature extraction;support vector machines;principal component analysis;regression analysis;time series;independent component analysis;forecasting theory","support vector machine;SVM;time series forecasting;feature extraction;principal component analysis;independent component analysis;generalization;regression estimation","","14","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The studies utilize microwave backscatter collected from 1) dielectric surfaces in an anechoic chamber and 2) a desert test site using P-, L-, and C-band NASA/JPL AIRSAR data. These experimental studies and supporting theory, indicate a sensitive decrease of |/spl rho//sub RRLL/| with increasing surface roughness ks over a range 0 /spl les/ ks /spl les/ 1. For the present studies this decrease is caused largely by the depolarizing effects of small-scale surface slopes in the azimuth direction rather than by volume, or multiple scatter. For cases when the scatter is reflection symmetric, the value of |/spl rho//sub RRLL/| depends on the surface roughness and on the local incidence angle. The dependence of |/spl rho//sub PRRLL/| on the local incidence angle is supported by theory and experimental results. For these same scattering cases, however, |/spl rho//sub PRRLL/| is independent of the surface dielectric constant.

PBG structures for microwave frequencies are applied in planar circuits such as microstrip line and CPW (coplanar waveguide). In this case, they are more frequently termed defected ground structures (DGS). Most of the research performed on DGS has been based on the equivalent circuit consisting of lumped elements, L and C, extracted from EM simulations (see D. Ahn et al., IEEE MTT, vol.49, 2001). In addition, we also consider radiation effects by including resistance, R, in the equivalent circuit. The general 1D periodic structures with N unit cells are analyzed using an ABCD matrix formulation. The effects of the RLC elements of the unit cell, the spacing between the unit cells, and the cell number, N, are investigated in detail. For a design example, a simple 1D DGS with N=2 is designed for harmonic control through a modeling using transmission line theory. This 1D DGS with N=2 is much simpler than the one proposed by Y. Horii and M. Tsutsmi (see IEEE MGWL, vol.9, no.1. p.1895-8, 1999).

Extracted parameters indicate that the coupling factor appears to be frequency-dependent and its maximum value rises rapidly as the aperture is widened. With the introduction of a single microstrip line section between two identical PCMLs, a broadband and compact multi-pole microstrip bandpass filter is proposed for the first time, and its electrical behaviour is studied and optimised on the basis of its equivalent circuit network. The network-based optimised results are confirmed by an EM simulation of the entire filter layout, featuring ultra-broadband and four-pole bandpass behaviour.

One of the advantages of an induction motor is its mechanical simplicity. This leads to not only to inherent reliability, but also to simpler design for shock requirements.

The method is based on parametric active contours and includes several adaptations that address important difficulties of cellular imaging, particularly the presence of low-contrast boundary deformations known as pseudopods, and the occurence of multiple contacts between cells. First, we use an edge map based on the average intensity dispersion that takes advantage of relative background homogeneity to facilitate the detection of both pseudopods and interfaces between adjacent cells. Second, we introduce a repulsive interaction between contours that allows correct segmentation of objects in contact and overcomes the shortcomings of previously reported techniques to enforce contour separation.

The average failure rate is combined with the TVWF to create time-varying failure rates (TVFRs) for each component. The average restoration time is combined with the TVWF to create time-varying restoration times (TVRTs). Studies conducted in a test distribution system show that the TVFR have large impacts on the interruption costs of frequency-sensitive customers and slight effects on others.

As compared with traditional parallel coupled lines, the proposed three-line design has the following two important features for the design of wideband filters: the tight line spacings of end stages can be greatly relaxed; and the stopband rejections are improved.

The number of endpoints per VPN is growing and the communication pattern between endpoints is becoming increasingly hard to predict. Consequently, users are demanding dependable, dynamic connectivity between endpoints, with the network expected to accommodate any traffic matrix, as long as the traffic to the endpoints does not overwhelm the capacity of the respective ingress and egress links. We propose a new service interface, termed a hose, to provide the appropriate performance abstraction. A hose is characterized by the aggregate traffic to and from one endpoint in the VPN to a set of other endpoints in the VPN, and by an associated performance guarantee. Hoses provide important advantages to a VPN customer: (1) flexibility to send traffic to a set of endpoints without having to specify the detailed traffic matrix, and (2) reduction in the size of access links through multiplexing gains obtained from the natural aggregation of the flows between endpoints. As compared with the conventional point-to-point (or customer pipe) model for managing quality of service (QoS), hoses provide reduction in the state information a customer must maintain. On the other hand, hoses would appear to increase the complexity of the already difficult problem of resource management to support QoS. To manage network resources in the face of this increased uncertainty, we consider both conventional statistical multiplexing techniques, and a new resizing technique based on online measurements. To study these performance issues, we run trace-driven simulations, using traffic derived from AT&T's voice network and from a large corporate data network. From the customer's perspective, we find that aggregation of traffic at the hose level provides significant multiplexing gains. From the provider's perspective, we find that the statistical multiplexing and resizing techniques deal effectively with uncertainties about the traffic, providing significant gains over the conventional alternative of a mesh of statically sized customer pipes between endpoints.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2002.803918","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1041074","","Resource management;Hoses;Virtual private networks;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Quality of service;Frame relay;Jacobian matrices;Aggregates;Quality management","business communication;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;quality of service;security of data;packet switching;transport protocols;Internet;computer network management","resource management;hoses;point-to-cloud services;virtual private networks;IP technologies;dynamic security associations;VPN;communication pattern;traffic matrix;service interface;performance abstraction;aggregate traffic;performance guarantee;access link size reduction;QoS;quality of service;statistical multiplexing;resizing technique;online measurements;trace-driven simulations;AT&T voice network;corporate data network;multiplexing gain;service level agreements;IETF;Internet","","158","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For this reason, there is currently a strong need for interworking mechanisms between WLANs and cellular data networks. We focus on these interworking mechanisms, which effectively combine WLANs and cellular data networks into integrated wireless data environments capable of ubiquitous data services and very high data rates in hotspot locations. We discuss the general aspects of integrated WLANs and cellular data networks, and we examine the generic interworking architectures that have been proposed in the technical literature.

Studies have shown characteristic frequency dispersions in the electrical conductivity and permittivity of malignant versus normal tissue. Using a multifrequency EIS system, we imaged the breasts of 26 women. All patients had mammograms ranked using the American College of Radiology (ACR) BIRADS system. Of the 51 individual breasts imaged, 38 were ACR 1 negative, six had ACR 4-5 suspicious lesions, and seven had ACR 2 benign findings such as fibroadenomas or calcifications. A radially translatable circular array of 16 Ag/AgCl electrodes was placed around the breast while the patient lay prone. We applied trigonometric voltage patterns at ten frequencies between 10 and 950 kHz. Anatomically coronal images were reconstructed from this data using nonlinear partial differential equation methods. Typically, ACR 1-rated breasts were interrogated in a single central plane whereas ACR 2-5-rated breasts were imaged in multiple planes covering the region of suspicion. In general, a characteristic homogeneous image emerged for mammographically normal cases while focal inhomogeneities were observed in images from women with malignancies. Using a specific visual criterion, EIS images identified 83% of the ACR 4-5 lesions while 67% were detected using a numerical criterion. Overall, multifrequency electrical impedance imaging appears promising for detecting breast malignancies, but improvements must be made before the method reaches its full potential.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2002.800606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1021930","","Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy;Frequency;Lesions;Noninvasive treatment;Breast cancer;Conductivity;Permittivity;Educational institutions;Radiology;Electrodes","cancer;electric impedance imaging;biological organs;mammography;medical image processing;image reconstruction","electrical impedance spectroscopy;breast;clinical imaging results;26 subjects;noninvasive technique;women;breast cancer;characteristic frequency dispersions;electrical conductivity;permittivity;malignant tissue;normal tissue;multifrequency EIS system;mammograms;American College of Radiology BIRADS system;ACR 1 negative;ACR 4-5 suspicious lesions;ACR 2 benign findings;fibroadenomas;calcifications;radially translatable circular array;Ag/AgCl electrodes;trigonometric voltage patterns;anatomically coronal image reconstruction;nonlinear partial differential equation methods;single central plane;multiple planes;region of suspicion;characteristic homogeneous image;mammographically normal cases;focal inhomogeneities;specific visual criterion;numerical criterion;multifrequency electrical impedance imaging;10 to 950 kHz;Ag-AgCl","Adult;Aged;Breast Neoplasms;Breast Neoplasms;Breast Neoplasms;Electric Impedance;False Positive Reactions;Female;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Mammography;Middle Aged;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Tomography;Tomography","132","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

GaN:RE ELDs emit light due to impact excitation of the rare earth (RE) ions by hot carriers followed by radiative RE relaxation. By appropriately choosing the RE dopant, narrow linewidth emission can be obtained at selected wavelengths from the ultraviolet to the infrared. The deposition of GaN:RE layers is carried out by solid-source molecular beam epitaxy, and a plasma N/sub 2/ source. Growth mechanisms and optimization of the GaN layers for RE emission are discussed based on RE concentration, growth temperature, and V/III ratio. The fabrication processes and electrical models for both dc- and ac-biased devices are discussed, along with techniques for multicolor integration. Visible emission at red, green, and blue wavelengths from GaN doped with Eu, Er, and Tm has led to the development of flat-panel display (FPD) devices. The brightness characteristics of thick dielectric EL (TDEL) display devices are reviewed as a function of bias, frequency, and time. High contrast TDEL devices using a black dielectric are presented. The fabrication and operation of FPD prototypes are described.

Traditional PM focuses on a single project at a single location and is more concerned with project inputs and outputs than with the project work itself. Traditional PM emphasizes scheduling, planning and tracking. The PM paradigm has begun to shift due to the increasing number of distributed projects involving team members from different sites, organizations and cultures. Current and future PM will be more concerned with project work and processes, and collaboration will become essential for success. Academics and practitioners have begun to discuss PM in terms of collaboration; however, there is little agreement as to a definition or interpretation of collaboration. One of the major changes in PM, over the last 25 years, has been the use of computerized tools and methods. In the future, the most significant change in PM may be the use of collaboration. In this article, we provide an explanation of different levels of collaboration, namely the communicative, collective, coordinated and concerted levels. Then we describe a prototype software package called C-PMS (Collaborative Project Management Software) to support 'concerted-level' collaboration among project team members.

The method is based on three characteristics of ECG artifacts: the spike-like property, the periodicity and the lack of correlation with the EEG. The method involves a two-step process: ECG artifact detection using the energy interval histogram (EIH) method and ECG artifact elimination using a modification of ensemble average subtraction. We applied a smoothed nonlinear energy operator to the contaminated EEG, which significantly emphasized the ECG artifacts compared with the background EEG. The EIH method was initially proposed to estimate the rate of false positives (FPs) and false negatives (FNs) that were necessary to determine the optimal threshold for the detection of the ECG artifact. As a postprocessing step, we used two types of threshold adjusting algorithms that were based on the periodicity of the ECG R-peaks. The technique was applied to four whole-night sleep EEG recordings from four subjects with severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, from which a total of 132 878 heartbeats were monitored over 31.8 h. We found that ECG artifacts were successfully detected and eliminated with FP = 0.017 and FN = 0.074 for the epochs where the elimination process is necessarily required.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2002.805482","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1159146","","Electrocardiography;Electroencephalography;Histograms;Sleep;Monitoring;Biometrics;Biomedical engineering;Psychiatry;Independent component analysis;Heart rate","electroencephalography;electrocardiography;sleep;medical signal processing;medical signal detection;patient monitoring","periodic ECG artifact elimination;automated detection;energy interval histogram method;EEG;electrocardiogram artifact detection;single-channel electroencephalogram;spike-like property;periodicity;two-step process;ECG artifact elimination;ensemble average subtraction;smoothed nonlinear energy operator;false positives;false negatives;optimal threshold;postprocessing step;threshold adjusting algorithms;ECG R-peak periodicity;whole-night sleep EEG recordings;severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome;heartbeats;epochs;31.8 h","Algorithms;Artifacts;Computer Simulation;Electrocardiography;Electrocardiography, Ambulatory;Humans;Models, Cardiovascular;Models, Statistical;Periodicity;Quality Control;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Sleep Apnea Syndromes","36","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This method exploits the colocation of the downstream transmitters and of the upstream receivers, in order to achieve far-end crosstalk (FEXT) cancellation and perform multiuser transmission optimization. The performance improvements are particularly pronounced in environments with strong FEXT such as in very high-speed DSL. Discrete multitone is employed for each user with additional constraints on the cyclic prefix length and with the assumption of block-synchronized transmission and reception for downstream and upstream transmission correspondingly. Within each tone, upstream crosstalk is removed by multiple-input-multiple-output decision feedback at the receiving side, while downstream crosstalk is eliminated by analogous preprocessing at the transmitting side. Additionally, the issue of transmission energy allocation in frequency and among users is addressed. Assuming frequency-division duplexing, the corresponding optimization problem is formulated and solved via convex programming both for a fixed upstream-downstream band plan and for a dynamically programmable band plan. The case of power backoff as a means to reduce the impact of crosstalk on alien systems is also treated.

A nonlinear system of this class is composed of multiple affine local linear models that are smoothly interpolated by weighting functions resulting from a fuzzy partitioning of the state space of a given nonlinear system subject to observation. The Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy system is then an accurate approximation of the original nonlinear system. Our approach to the analysis and design of observers for Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems is based on extending sliding mode observer schemes to the case of interpolated multiple local affine linear models. Thus, our main contribution is nonlinear observer analysis and design methods that can effectively deal with model/plant mismatches. Furthermore, we consider the difficult case when the weighting functions in the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy system depend on the estimated state.","1941-0492","","10.1109/3477.979966","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=979966","","Takagi-Sugeno model;Fuzzy systems;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Nonlinear systems;Observers;Uncertainty;Design methodology;Linear systems;State estimation;Interpolation","fuzzy control;fuzzy logic;variable structure systems;nonlinear systems;interpolation;observers","Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy system observers;sliding mode observers;dynamic Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems;nonlinear system;multiple affine local linear models;weighting functions;fuzzy partitioning;state space;accurate approximation;original nonlinear system;sliding mode observer schemes;interpolated multiple local affine linear models;nonlinear observer analysis;model/plant mismatches;estimated state","","162","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The two strategies together can produce PWM waveforms with any odd pulse number, preserving the waveform symmetries. The proposed strategies operate upto the six-step mode, maintaining the proportionality between the reference magnitude and the fundamental voltage generated throughout. These two strategies lead to lesser harmonic distortion as well as lesser peak current over the conventional space vector strategy (CSVS) in the high speed ranges of constant V/F drives. The reduction in the harmonic distortion over CSVS subject to a given maximum switching frequency (F/sub SW(MAX)/) of the inverter is demonstrated theoretically as well as experimentally for F/sub SW(MAX)/=750 Hz and 450 Hz, both with and without overmodulation. The best reduction in the distortion is as high as 30% to 50% in the different cases considered. Further, these two PWM strategies are also useful in reducing the switching frequency of the inverter over sine-triangle PWM and CSVS subject to an upper limit on the harmonic distortion.","1941-0107","","10.1109/63.988673","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=988673","","Space vector pulse width modulation;Pulse width modulation;Pulse width modulation inverters;Voltage;Harmonic distortion;Frequency synchronization;Switching frequency;Induction motor drives;Pulse inverters;Total harmonic distortion","PWM invertors;DC-AC power convertors;switching circuits;induction motor drives;power conversion harmonics;harmonic distortion;synchronisation;harmonics suppression","synchronized bus-clamping PWM strategies;space vector approach;high-power induction motor drives;waveform symmetries preservation;fundamental voltage;reference magnitude;harmonic distortion reduction;peak current reduction;space vector strategy;invertor switching frequency;750 Hz;450 Hz","","66","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately,ML detection (MLD) is a nondeterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) problem, for which there is no known algorithm that can find the optimal solution with polynomial-time complexity (in the number of users). In this paper, a polynomial-time approximation method called semi-definite (SD) relaxation is applied to the MLD problem with antipodal data transmission. SD relaxation is an accurate approximation method for certain NP-hard problems. The SD relaxation ML (SDR-ML) detector is efficient in that its complexity is of the order of K3.5, where K is the number of users. We illustrate the potential of the SDR-ML detector by showing that some existing detectors, such as the decorrelator and the linear-minimum-mean-square-error detector, can be interpreted as degenerate forms of the SDR-ML detector. Simulation results indicate that the BER performance of the SDR-ML detector is better than that of these existing detectors and is close to that of the true ML detector, even when the cross-correlations between users are strong or the near-far effect is significant.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.992139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=992139","Maximum likelihood detection;multiuser detection;relaxation methods;semi-definite programming","Multiuser detection;Detectors;NP-hard problem;Maximum likelihood detection;Bit error rate;Approximation methods;Multiaccess communication;Interference;Code division multiplexing","","","","233","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Sci., Cornell Univ., Ithaca, NY, USA","Proceedings International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks","","2002","","","303","312","Several distributed peer-to-peer applications require weakly-consistent knowledge of process group membership information at all participating processes. SWIM is a generic software module that offers this service for large scale process groups. The SWIM effort is motivated by the unscalability of traditional heart-beating protocols, which either impose network loads that grow quadratically with group size, or compromise response times or false positive frequency w.r.t. detecting process crashes. This paper reports on the design, implementation and performance of the SWIM sub-system on a large cluster of commodity PCs. Unlike traditional heart beating protocols, SWIM separates the failure detection and membership update dissemination functionalities of the membership protocol. Processes are monitored through an efficient peer-to-peer periodic randomized probing protocol. Both the expected time to first detection of each process failure, and the expected message load per member do not vary with group size. Information about membership changes, such as process joins, drop-outs and failures, is propagated via piggybacking on ping messages and acknowledgments. This results in a robust and fast infection style (also epidemic or gossip-style) of dissemination. The rate of false failure detections in the SWIM system is reduced by modifying the protocol to allow group members to suspect a process before declaring it as failed - this allows the system to discover and rectify false failure detections. Finally, the protocol guarantees a deterministic time bound to detect failures. Experimental results from the SWIM prototype are presented. We discuss the extensibility of the design to a WAN-wide scale.","","0-7695-1597-5","10.1109/DSN.2002.1028914","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1028914","","Protocols;Peer to peer computing;Application software;Large-scale systems;Delay;Frequency;Computer crashes;Personal communication networks;Condition monitoring;Robustness","protocols;workstation clusters;wide area networks;computer network reliability","SWIM;scalable weakly-consistent infection-style protocol;process group membership protocol;distributed peer-to-peer applications;generic software module;heart-beating protocol;response times;network loads;performance;PC cluster;failure detection;membership update;periodic randomized probing protocol;piggybacking;ping messages;deterministic time bound;experimental results;WAN","","50","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on the physical characteristics of incremental encoders, the proposed method allows the user to select the estimation precision and tune the time delay, and yet requires less calculation than other methods.

The spiked electrode consists of an array of microneedles penetrating the outer skin layers. We found a significant dependency of the electrode-skin-electrode impedance (ESEI) on the electrode size (i.e., the number of spikes) and the coating material of the spikes. Electrodes larger than 3/spl times/3 mm/sup 2/ coated with Ag-AgCl have sufficiently low ESEI to be well suited for electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings. The maximum measured ESEI was 4.24 k/spl Omega/ and 87 k/spl Omega/, at 1 kHz and 0.6 Hz, respectively. The minimum ESEI was 0.65 k/spl Omega/ an 16 k/spl Omega/, at the same frequencies. The ESEI of spiked electrodes is stable over an extended period of time. The arithmetic mean of the generated DC offset voltage is 11.8 mV immediately after application on the skin and 9.8 mV after 20-30 min. A spectral study of the generated potential difference revealed that the AC part was unstable at frequencies below approximately 0.8 Hz. Thus, the signal does not interfere with a number of clinical applications using real-time EEG.

The time delay exists in the data communication for this controller. Long time delay may be a detriment to wide area control system stability and delay may degrade system robustness. This paper analyzes the impact of time delay on robust wide area controller design in power systems. Time delay is described using the Pade approximation and is simulated within the robust wide area control system. According to numerous simulations, it is found that the overshoot value of active power variation increases and the settling time is lengthened when time delay occurs. The closed-loop control system may become unstable when the time delay is over a certain value. A robust controller can be redesigned to accommodate the possible long time delay. The impact of time delay on robust controller design is studied using a two-area four-machine system.","","0-7803-7322-7","10.1109/PESW.2002.985276","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=985276","","Delay effects;Robust control;Power system control;Power systems;Control systems;Power system stability;Communication system control;Power system dynamics;Power system simulation;Power system analysis computing","power system control;power system stability;control system synthesis;matrix algebra;robust control;approximation theory;control system analysis;delay systems;closed loop systems","power system robust control design;time delay impact;centralized wide area controller design;dynamic performance enhancement;wide area control system stability;robustness;control simulation;Pade approximation;overshoot value;closed-loop control system;two-area four-machine system;linear matrix inequality","","34","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The two-phase supply is obtained from the conventional single-phase utility supply by using a two-phase inverter. The adverse effects of most of the harmonics associated with the use of the two-phase inverter are alleviated by canceling/attenuating the dominant harmonics in the motor terminal voltages using the selective harmonic elimination (SHE) pulse width modulation (PWM) technique.. The performance of the motor is analyzed using computer simulation and is then compared with that of a conventional single-phase capacitor start induction motor. For a comprehensive comparison, the analysis is performed at both the transient and steady-state cases. Furthermore, frequency analysis is conducted with a view to provide more insight into the operation of the proposed scheme. The proposed mode of operation allows the single-phase induction motor to gain the advantages of the poly-phase motor such as starting torque, less torque harmonics and higher rated power.","","0-7803-7474-6","10.1109/IECON.2002.1185403","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1185403","","Induction motors;Pulse width modulation inverters;Performance analysis;Torque;Voltage;Pulse inverters;Computer simulation;Capacitors;Transient analysis;Steady-state","induction motor drives;PWM invertors;power conversion harmonics;harmonics suppression;digital simulation;electric machine analysis computing;starting;torque","single-phase induction motor;two-phase motor;two-phase supply;single-phase utility supply;two-phase inverter;harmonics;dominant harmonics attenuation;dominant harmonics cancellation;selective harmonic elimination;pulse width modulation;motor terminal voltages;computer simulation;single-phase capacitor start induction motor;frequency analysis;starting torque;higher rated power;unsymmetrical induction motor;motor losses","","14","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The estimation method is based on the maximum-likelihood criterion and is applied to two different scenarios: either with known symbols (DA estimation) or with unknown symbols (NDA estimation). The effects of the estimation errors on the performance of a RAKE receiver are assessed by simulation by comparing the receiver bit-error rate with either perfect channel estimates or imperfect estimates as obtained from the proposed algorithms. The results show that the degradations are tolerable as long as the number of users is limited.

Microwave radar developments during and after the war are reviewed, along with a listing of current military and civilian applications. The dependence of modern radar on digital processing (with clock rates at microwave frequencies), high-power transmitters, and sophisticated antennas is discussed. The paper concludes by mentioning possible future directions for radar, and briefly describes two examples of future radar system opportunities.

These surfaces behave like an artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) in a specific frequency range; the inclusion of the dielectric layers allows us to enhance the angular properties of the AMC as well as the frequency bandwidth of the device. In order to obtain the proper values of the design parameters, a genetic algorithm (GA) is employed that makes use of an electromagnetic solver based on the method of moments (MoM) to evaluate the scattering properties of the structure. A key step in the design procedure is the inclusion in the fitness function of the electromagnetic response of the high-impedance surface with respect to the illumination angle. The synthesized structure shows the desired frequency performance and reveals robust as concerns the stability of the solution with respect to a wide interval of illumination angles.","1548-5757","","10.1109/LAWP.2002.807956","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1178244","","Conductors;Frequency selective surfaces;Electromagnetic scattering;Lighting;Robust stability;Magnetic devices;Dielectric devices;Magnetic properties;Bandwidth;Algorithm design and analysis","frequency selective surfaces;electromagnetic wave scattering;genetic algorithms;method of moments;microwave materials;UHF radio propagation","artificial magnetic conductors;multilayered frequency selective surfaces;multilayered dielectric structure;capacitive frequency selective surface;FSS;perfectly electric conducting ground plane;PEC ground plane;high-impedance surfaces;angular properties;frequency bandwidth;genetic algorithm;electromagnetic solver;method of moments;scattering properties;design procedure;electromagnetic response;illumination angle;stability;1.71 to 1.88 GHz","","55","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Both these objectives are achieved, irrespective of unbalance and harmonic distortions in load currents or source voltages. The chosen DSTATCOM topology includes three single-phase voltage source inverters connected in parallel to a filter-capacitor, which allows the high-frequency component of the current to pass.

"Control of power quality in inverter-based distributed generation","M. Prodanovic; T. C.

IECON 02","","2002","2","","1185","1189 vol.2","Power quality is an important additional service of inverter-based interfaces for distributed generators. In grid connected applications the power quality depends on the harmonic content of the current injected at the point of common coupling. By careful design of the power converter and its output filter the switching frequency components in the output current spectrum can be reduced to low levels. The effect of the harmonic distortion of the grid voltage on the output current can be minimised by using an appropriate inverter control strategy. Conventional control methods (manipulation of inverter voltage magnitude and phase) offer active and reactive power control, but not the control of the output current quality. This paper describes a new choice of control structure and explains the interaction between the applied control loops. The inverter is used to control the current in the first element of an LCL filter. A further controller is wrapped around this loop to control power export to the grid. The usefulness of this arrangement in providing big power quality is emphasised. Experimental results from a 10 kVA prototype are used to evaluate the distortion rejection properties and the regulation of active and reactive power control. The results show high quality of generated power and excellent transient and steady state-response to both active and reactive power demands.","","0-7803-7474-6","10.1109/IECON.2002.1185441","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1185441","","Power quality;Distributed control;Inverters;Voltage control;Power generation;Power harmonic filters;Reactive power control;Distributed power generation;Power system harmonics;Switching converters","distributed power generation;invertors;power supply quality;power system harmonics;switching convertors;harmonic distortion;harmonics suppression;electric current control;reactive power control;power system control","power quality control;inverter-based distributed generation;inverter-based interfaces;grid connected applications;power quality;harmonic content;point of common coupling;switching frequency components;output current spectrum;grid voltage;output current;inverter voltage magnitude manipulation;reactive power control;active power control;output current quality;control loops;LCL filter;distortion rejection properties;steady state-response;transient response;10 kVA","","12","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Lee","Canterbury Univ., Christchurch, New Zealand; NA; NA","IEEE Communications Magazine","","2002","40","1","132","139","In telecommunication networks, as in many other areas of science and engineering, the proliferation of computers as research tools has resulted in the adoption of computer simulation as the most commonly used paradigm of scientific investigations. This, together with a plethora of existing simulation languages and packages, has created a popular opinion that simulation is mainly an exercise in computer programming. In new computing environments, programming can be minimized, or even fully replaced, by the manipulation of icons (representing prebuilt programming objects containing basic functional blocks of simulated systems) on a computer monitor. One can say that we have witnessed another success of modern science and technology: the emergence of wonderful and powerful tools for exploring and predicting the behavior of such complex stochastic dynamic systems as telecommunication networks. But this enthusiasm is not shared by all researchers in this area. An opinion is spreading that one cannot rely on the majority of the published results on performance evaluation studies of telecommunication networks based on stochastic simulation, since they lack credibility. Indeed, the spread of this phenomenon is so wide that one can speak about a deep crisis of credibility. In this article this claim is supported by the results of a survey of over 2200 publications on telecommunication networks in proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM and such journals as IEEE Transactions on Communications, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, and Performance Evaluation Journal. The discussion focuses on two important necessary conditions of a credible simulation study: use of appropriate pseudo-random generators of independent uniformly distributed numbers, and appropriate analysis of simulation output data. Having considered their perils and pitfalls, we formulate guidelines that, if observed, could help to ensure a basic level of credibility of simulation studies of telecommunication networks.","1558-1896","","10.1109/35.978060","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=978060","","Computational modeling;Computer simulation;Functional programming;Analytical models;Computer networks;Telecommunication computing;Packaging;Computer displays;Stochastic systems;Stochastic processes","stochastic systems;random number generation;discrete event simulation;telecommunication networks;telecommunication computing","simulation studies;telecommunication networks;research tools;computer simulation;simulation languages;simulation packages;computer programming;computing environments;programming objects;functional blocks;simulated systems;stochastic dynamic systems;performance evaluation studies;credibility;pseudo-random generators;uniformly distributed numbers;simulation output data;stochastic discrete-event simulation;performance evaluation;independent uniformly distributed numbers","","212","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This is now improved to have a linear relation between on resistance (R/sub on/) and breakdown voltage (BV) instead of the quadratic relation. Theory of novel voltage sustaining layers (SJ-theory) recently published analytically models the super junction drift layers (SJ-drift layer). The authors have designed SJ-layers based on this theory and used to construct the SJ-MOSFET: CoolMOS structure. The claim of the theory that the doping level in the drift layer can now be increased by at least me order of magnitude without lowering BV is analyzed in detail. With the new silicon limit, one now can increase BV of a power device, just by increasing thickness of the SJ-drift layer. R/sub on/ and BV relationship as the thickness of the device varies is analyzed with the help of simulation. The limitations and constraints of applying SJ-theory for the CoolMOS structure are discussed. The SJ- theory does not model the behavior of R/sub on/ and BV for a fixed geometry as doping level changes. The authors observed that for a fixed geometry the rate of reduction of the BV depends on the cell pitch. This rate is large for the higher cell pitch. The effect of charge imbalance created due the channel region in CoolMOS is also investigated.","","0-7803-7262-X","10.1109/PSEC.2002.1023067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1023067","","MOSFET circuits;Power MOSFET;Doping;Geometry;Electric resistance;Voltage;Silicon;Semiconductor process modeling;Student members;Microelectronics","power MOSFET;semiconductor device models;semiconductor doping;p-n junctions","super junction power MOSFET CoolMOS/sup TM/;voltage sustaining layer theory;on resistance;breakdown voltage;super junction drift layers;doping level;silicon limit;simulation;cell pitch;charge imbalance;channel region","","9","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For a p-element sliding window, our algorithm computes the 1D filter using 1.5 + o(1) comparisons per sample point. Our algorithm constitutes a deterministic improvement over the best previously known such algorithm, independently developed by van Herk (1992) and by Gil and Werman (1993) (the HGW algorithm). Also, the results presented in this paper constitute an improvement over the Gevorkian et al. (1997) (GAA) variant of the HGW algorithm. The improvement over the GAA variant is also in the computation model. The GAA algorithm makes the assumption that the input is independently and identically distributed (the i.i.d. assumption), whereas our main result is deterministic. We also deal with the problem of computing the dilation and erosion filters simultaneously, as required, e.g., for computing the unbiased morphological edge. In the case of i.i.d. inputs, we show that this simultaneous computation can be done more efficiently then separately computing each. We then turn to the opening filter, defined as the application of the min filter to the max filter and give an efficient algorithm for its computation. Specifically, this algorithm is only slightly slower than the computation of just the max filter. The improved algorithms are readily generalized to two dimensions (for a rectangular window), as well as to any higher finite dimension (for a hyperbox window), with the number of comparisons per window remaining constant. For the sake of concreteness, we also make a few comments on implementation considerations in a contemporary programming language.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2002.1114852","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1114852","","Filters;Image edge detection;Image analysis;Gas insulated transmission lines;Morphology;Image processing;Pattern analysis;Morphological operations;Fault detection;Computational modeling","image processing;deterministic algorithms;mathematical morphology;computational complexity","deterministic algorithm;one-dimensional dilation;sliding window filters;1D filter;computation model;erosion filters;unbiased morphological edge;computational complexity;min filter;max filter;image processing;programming language;mathematical morphology","","79","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With a fixed S/D doping profile, larger silicon-on-insulator (SOI) thickness can suppress short-channel effects due to the coexistence of longer channel regions. There can be some design margin in the channel thickness due to this reduced short-channel effect. Drain saturation current in FinFET is proportional to the effective device width and SOI thickness. To determine the appropriate SOI thickness of FinFET, alternating current (AC) characteristics are investigated. Device capacitance increases with SOI thickness, but this is not for the gate delay, as the drive current also increases and compensates for the increase of capacitance. When driving a constant capacitance load such as interconnect, devices with larger drain current or thicker SOI are more favorable for the fixed S/D doping condition.","1941-0085","","10.1109/TNANO.2002.807373","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176970","","Electric variables;FinFETs;Doping profiles;Silicon on insulator technology;Capacitance;Implants;MOSFETs;Delay;Robustness;Two dimensional displays","silicon-on-insulator;MOSFET;doping profiles;capacitance;semiconductor device models","electrical characteristics;FinFET characteristics;vertically nonuniform source/drain doping profile;three-dimensional device simulation;3D device simulation;SOI thickness;short-channel effect suppression;channel regions;drain saturation current;effective device width;AC characteristics;capacitance;double-gate device;Si","","18","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Each module is divided into smaller modules. Two bits selection determines which operation takes place at a particular time. The pipeline modules are independent of each other. All the modules in the ALU design are realized using VHDL. Design functionalities are validated through simulation and compilation.

The device stretched the ankle safely throughout the range of motion (ROM) to extreme dorsiflexion and plantarflexion until a specified peak resistance torque was reached with the stretching velocity controlled based on the resistance torque. The ankle was held at the extreme position for a period of time to let stress relaxation occur before it was rotated back to the other extreme position. Stretching was slow at the joint extreme positions, making it possible to reach a larger ROM safely and it was fast in the middle ROM so the majority of the treatment was spent in stretching the problematic extreme ROM. Furthermore, the device evaluated treatment outcome quantitatively in multiple aspects, including active and passive ROM, joint stiffness and viscous damping and reflex excitability. The stretching resulted in considerable changes in joint passive ROM, stiffness, viscous damping and reflex gain. The intelligent control and yet simple design of the device suggest that with appropriate simplification, the device can be made portable and low cost, making it available to patients and therapists for frequent use in clinics/home and allowing more effective treatment and long-term improvement.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2002.802857","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1114834","","Medical treatment;Read only memory;Damping;Multiple sclerosis;Muscles;Orthopedic surgery;Sun;Motion control;Torque control;Velocity control","elasticity;torque;biomechanics;orthopaedics;stress relaxation;patient treatment;biomedical equipment;damping","reflex;spasticity;stiffness;stretch;stroke;viscous damping;extreme position;stress relaxation;intelligent ankle joints stretching;neurologically impaired patients;extreme dorsiflexion;plantarflexion","Adult;Ankle Joint;Artificial Intelligence;Contracture;Contracture;Elasticity;Equipment Design;Feasibility Studies;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Motion Therapy, Continuous Passive;Motion Therapy, Continuous Passive;Muscle Spasticity;Muscle Spasticity;Range of Motion, Articular;Reflex, Stretch;Rotation;Sensitivity and Specificity;Stroke;Torque;Treatment Outcome;Viscosity","91","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The author describes two approaches that help to identify the body of knowledge software engineers need to achieve this goal. The first approach derives knowledge requirements from a set of issues identified during two standards efforts: the IEEE Std. 1061-1998 for a Software Quality Metrics Methodology and the American National Standard Recommended Practice for Software Reliability (ANSI/AIAA R-013-1992). The second approach ties these knowledge requirements to phases in the software development life cycle. Together, these approaches define a body of knowledge that shows software engineers why and when to measure quality. Focusing on the entire software development life cycle, rather than just the coding phase, gives software engineers the comprehensive knowledge they need to enhance software quality and supports early detection and resolution of quality problems. The integration of product and process measurements lets engineers assess the interactions between them throughout the life cycle. Software engineers can apply this body of knowledge as a guideline for incorporating quality measurement in their projects. Professional licensing and training programs will also find it useful.","1558-0814","","10.1109/2.982919","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=982919","","Software quality;Software measurement;Knowledge engineering;Reliability engineering;ANSI standards;Software standards;Programming;Software reliability;Phase detection;Guidelines","software quality;software engineering;software metrics","software development life cycle;software quality;quality measurement","","34","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The methodology solves the conventional problems of previously developed master-slave systems with force feedback, such as oscillations, complex structures and complicated control algorithm. In the present paper a multi-fingered exoskeleton haptic device (master hand) with passive force feedback function is developed. First, the exoskeleton master hand with three fingers (12 degrees of freedom) is designed and implemented. Each finger of the master hand consists of a link mechanism with elastic-shaft joints and clutches. Using link mechanisms, the master hand measures fingertip positions and angles of index finger middle finger and thumb. Furthermore, it also enables passive force feedback to an operator by the same link mechanism used for the geometric measurements. Then, a virtual reality system of human hand is constructed using the master hand and the control methodology. Using the system, sensory evaluations are conducted on human subjects to confirm the usability of the developed master hand and the possibility of the control methodology in the virtual reality system. As a result, the subjects possibly recognize the stiffness of the objects in the virtual environment.","","0-7803-7398-7","10.1109/IRDS.2002.1041713","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1041713","","Exoskeletons;Haptic interfaces;Force feedback;Control systems;Fingers;Force control;Master-slave;Virtual reality;Humans;Position measurement","dexterous manipulators;haptic interfaces;force feedback;telerobotics;virtual reality","multifingered exoskeleton haptic device;passive force feedback;dexterous teleoperation;master-slave systems;force feedback;oscillations;complex structures;master hand;axoskeleton master hand;fingers;elastic-shaft joints;clutches;fingertip position measurement;finger angle measurement","","41","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

WLAN services in the outdoor as well as indoor environments should be designed in order to achieve the maximum coverage and throughput. To provide the maximum coverage for WLAN service areas, AP should be installed such that the sum of signal measured at each traffic demand point is maximized. However, as users connected to an AP share wireless channel bandwidth with others in the same AP, AP placement should be carefully decided to maximize the throughput by considering load balancing among AP and channel interference for the user traffic demand. In this paper, therefore, we propose an approach of optimizing AP placement and channel assignment in WLAN by formulating an optimal integer linear programming (ILP) problem. The optimization objective is to minimize the maximum of channel utilization, which qualitatively represents congestion at the hot spot in WLAN service areas. It is seen from the simulation results that the proposed method finds the optimal AP placement and channels which minimize the maximum of channel utilization.","0742-1303","0-7695-1591-6","10.1109/LCN.2002.1181869","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1181869","","Wireless LAN;Local area networks;Throughput;Area measurement;Indoor environments;Load management;Mobile computing;Computer networks;Buildings;Frequency","minimax techniques;channel allocation;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN;indoor radio;cochannel interference;adjacent channel interference;integer programming;linear programming;telecommunication congestion control","optimization;AP placement;channel assignment;wireless LAN;wireless local area network;WLAN;access points;indoor environments;outdoor environments;maximum coverage;throughput;service areas;traffic demand point;load balancing;channel interference;user traffic demand;integer linear programming;ILP;minimax method;channel utilization;congestion;hot spot","","62","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Detection of small objects in clutter using a GA-RBF neural network","H. Leung; N. Dubash; N. Xie","Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Calgary Univ., Alta., Canada; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","","2002","38","1","98","118","Detection of small objects in a radar or satellite image is an important problem with many applications. Due to a recent discovery that sea clutter, the electromagnetic wave backscatter from a sea surface, is chaotic rather than purely random, computational intelligence techniques such as neural networks have been applied to reconstruct the chaotic dynamic of sea clutter. The reconstructed sea clutter dynamical system which usually takes the form of a nonlinear predictor does not only provide a model of the sea scattering phenomenon, but it can also be used to detect the existence of small targets such as fishing boats and small fragments of icebergs by observing abrupt changes in the prediction error. We applied a genetic algorithm (GA) to obtain an optimal reconstruction of sea clutter dynamic based on a radial basis function (RBF) neural network. This GA-RBF uses a hybrid approach that employes a GA to search for the optimum values of the following RBF parameters: centers, variance, and number of hidden nodes, and uses the least square method to determine the weights. It is shown here that if the functional form of an unknown nonlinear dynamical system can be represented exactly using an RBF net (i.e., no approximation error), this GA-RBF approach can reconstruct the exact dynamic from its time series measurements. In addition to the improved accuracy in modeling sea clutter dynamic, the GA-RBF is also shown to enhance the detectability of small objects embedded in the sea. Using real-life radar data that are collected in the east coast of Canada by two different radar systems: a ground-based radar and a satellite equipped with synthetic aperture radar (SAR), we show that the GA-RBF network is a reliable detector for small surface targets in various sea conditions and is practical for real-life search and rescue, navigation, and surveillance applications.","1557-9603","","10.1109/7.993232","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=993232","","Object detection;Neural networks;Clutter;Radar detection;Radar applications;Spaceborne radar;Image reconstruction;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Synthetic aperture radar;Satellites","object detection;radar clutter;chaos;time series;nonlinear dynamical systems;synthetic aperture radar;marine radar;search radar;radar imaging;genetic algorithms;radial basis function networks","small objects detection;GA-RBF neural network;radar image;sea clutter;chaotic dynamic;optimal reconstruction;hybrid approach;number of hidden nodes;unknown nonlinear dynamical system;time series;ground-based radar;synthetic aperture radar;small surface targets;various sea conditions;search and rescue;surveillance;marine radar system;X-band radar","","78","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using these, a new and computationally efficient performance optimization techniques for distributed RLC interconnects has been introduced. The new optimization technique has been employed to analyze the impact of line inductance on the circuit behavior and to illustrate the implications of technology scaling on wire inductance. It is shown that reduction in driver output resistance and input capacitance with scaling can make deep submicron designs increasingly susceptible to inductance effects if global interconnects are not scaled.

Existing research on travel time estimation directly records the travel time of a probe vehicle and calculates the mean of travel times from a number of probe vehicles. This paper describes a new approach to estimate travel time by using a single probe vehicle based on the analysis of the speed-time profile. According to the features extracted from the speed profile, the driving pattern of a probe vehicle is classified by using fuzzy sets. Differing from the traditional concept in the research of driving behaviour, the driving pattern in this study is only associated with the difference between the travel time of the probe vehicle and mean travel time. A new variable, the maximum continuous acceleration (MCA), is introduced to reflect acceleration characteristics of the driver by combining the continuous acceleration and speed at the acceleration starting point. The MCA and average speed of a probe vehicle are taken as the input variables of fuzzy sets. The membership function values are determined by historical traffic data of the tested road segment. The travel time is calculated by corresponding equations for different driving patterns. A comparison of the estimated travel time and actual mean travel time illustrates the value of the approach.","","0-7803-7389-8","10.1109/ITSC.2002.1041345","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1041345","","Global Positioning System;Probes;Acceleration;Vehicle driving;Fuzzy sets;Feature extraction;Input variables;Testing;Roads;Differential equations","road vehicles;Global Positioning System;data acquisition;acceleration;driver information systems;traffic engineering computing;fuzzy set theory","travel time estimation;data acquisition;speed-time profile;fuzzy set theory;maximum continuous acceleration;membership function;Global Positioning System;GPS equipped probe vehicle","","12","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The rapid technological advances have made it possible to implement (cost-effective, short-range) impulse radar and impulse-radio communication and localization systems. Array beamforming and space-time processing techniques promise further advancement in the operational capabilities of impulse radar and impulse-radio communications to achieve long-range coverage, high capacity and interference-free quality of reception. We introduce a realistic signal model for UWB impulse waveforms and develop the principles of space-time array processing based on the signal model. A space-time resolution function (STRF), a space-frequency distribution function (SFDF) and a monopulse-tracking signal are derived for impulse waveforms received by a self-steering array beamforming system. The directivity peak-power pattern and energy pattern of the beamformer are also derived. Computer plots of the STRF, SFDF and the beam patterns are obtained. The directivity beam patterns of impulse waveforms are sidelobe-free and, therefore, there is no need for sidelobe suppression via amplitude weighting of the array elements. Also, the resolution angle for the beam patterns is derived as a decreasing function of array size and frequency bandwidth. Electronic beamsteering based on slope processing of monopulse waveforms is described.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2002.1002490","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1002490","","Array signal processing;Space technology;Signal processing;Energy resolution;Spaceborne radar;Interference;Signal resolution;Distribution functions;Frequency;Bandwidth","radar signal processing;array signal processing;space-time adaptive processing;antenna radiation patterns;adaptive antenna arrays;directive antennas;radio links;multipath channels;cochannel interference;jamming","space-time array processing;ultrawide-band impulse radar;ultrawide-band impulse-radio communications;impulse-radio localization systems;space-time resolution function;space-frequency distribution function;monopulse-tracking signal;self-steering array beamforming;directivity beam patterns;adaptive array antenna;adaptive signal processing;multipath reception;cochannel interference;active jamming","","98","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In effect, the SOF controller replaces an experienced human operator, which otherwise would have readjusted the PID gains during the system operation. The three PID gains are tuned using classical tuning techniques prior to the application of the SOF controller at the supervisory level. Two trajectories of step input and path tracking were applied to the SOF-PID controller at the setpoint. For comparison purposes, the same experiments were repeated by using the self-organizing fuzzy controller (SOFC) and the PID controller subject to the same information supplied at the setpoint. For the step input, the SOF-PID controller produced a aster rise time, a smaller steady state error, and an insignificant overshoot than the SOFC and the PID controller.

The algorithm estimates the data density in each class by using parametric nonlinear functions that fit to the non-Gaussian structure of the data. This improves classification accuracy compared with standard Gaussian mixture models. When applied to images, the algorithm can learn efficient codes (basis functions) for images that capture the statistically significant structure intrinsic in the images. We apply this technique to the problem of unsupervised classification, segmentation, and denoising of images. We demonstrate that this method was effective in classifying complex image textures such as natural scenes and text. It was also useful for denoising and filling in missing pixels in images with complex structures. The advantage of this model is that image codes can be learned with increasing numbers of classes thus providing greater flexibility in modeling structure and in finding more image features than in either Gaussian mixture models or standard independent component analysis (ICA) algorithms.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.988960","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=988960","","Image classification;Image segmentation;Noise reduction;Independent component analysis;Classification algorithms;Image texture;Layout;Filling;Pixel;Code standards","unsupervised learning;image classification;image enhancement;image segmentation;image coding;higher order statistics;image texture;natural scenes","ICA mixture models;unsupervised image classification;unsupervised image segmentation;unsupervised image enhancement;mutually exclusive classes;independent nonGaussian densities;parametric nonlinear functions;basis functions;statistically significant structure;image denoising;complex image textures;image codes;independent component analysis;Gaussian mixture model;higher-order statistics","","71","","39","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Reconstruction of nonuniformly sampled bandlimited signals by means of digital fractional delay filters","H. Johansson; P. Lowenborg","Dept. of Electr. Eng., Linkoping Univ., Sweden; Dept. of Electr. Eng., Linkoping Univ., Sweden","IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","","2002","50","11","2757","2767","This paper considers the problem of reconstructing a class of nonuniformly sampled bandlimited signals of which a special case occurs in, e.g., time-interleaved analog-to-digital converter (ADC) systems due to time-skew errors. To this end, we propose a synthesis system composed or digital fractional delay filters. The overall system (i.e., nonuniform sampling and the proposed synthesis system) can be viewed as a generalization of time-interleaved ADC systems to which the former reduces as a special case. Compared with existing reconstruction techniques, our method has major advantages from an implementation point of view. To be precise, (1) we can perform the reconstruction as well as desired (in a certain sense) by properly designing the digital fractional delay filters, and (2) if properly implemented, the fractional delay filters need not be redesigned in case the time skews are changed. The price to pay for these attractive features is that we need to use a slight oversampling. It should be stressed, however, that the oversampling factor is less than two as compared with the Nyquist rate. The paper includes error and quantization noise analysis. The former is useful in the analysis of the quantization noise and when designing practical fractional delay filters approximating the ideal filters.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2002.804089","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1041033","","Sampling methods;Digital filters;Nonuniform sampling;Signal processing;Analog-digital conversion;Signal synthesis;Delay effects;Quantization;1f noise;Reconstruction algorithms","digital filters;delay filters;channel bank filters;network synthesis;quantisation (signal);noise;bandlimited signals;signal reconstruction;signal sampling;error analysis;analogue processing circuits","nonuniformly sampled bandlimited signals reconstruction;digital fractional delay filters;time-interleaved analog-to-digital converter;time-interleaved ADC systems;time-skew errors;synthesis system;nonuniform sampling;oversampling;Nyquist rate;error noise analysis;quantization noise analysis;ideal filters;filter design;hybrid analog/digital filterbanks;real-time applications;perfect reconstruction system;regionally perfect reconstruction system","","125","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous image formation algorithms were mainly based on direct Fourier reconstruction to take advantage of the FFT, but the irregular coverage of the available Fourier domain data and the 2-D interpolation in the Fourier domain may adversely affect the accuracy of image reconstruction. Back-projection techniques avoid Fourier-domain interpolation, but ordinarily have huge computational cost. We present a fast back-projection algorithm for bistatic SAR imaging, motivated by a fast back-projection algorithm previously proposed for tomography. It has a reduced computational cost, on the same order as that of direct Fourier reconstruction. Furthermore, this approach can be used for near-field imaging. Simulation results verify the performance of this new algorithm.","1522-4880","0-7803-7622-6","10.1109/ICIP.2002.1039984","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1039984","","Radar polarimetry;Computational efficiency;Image reconstruction;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Interpolation;Tomography;Geometry;Transmitters;Costs","synthetic aperture radar;radar imaging;image reconstruction;integral equations;tomography","fast back-projection algorithm;bistatic SAR imaging;synthetic aperture radar;image formation algorithms;computational cost reduction;direct Fourier reconstruction;FFT;Fourier domain data;2D interpolation;tomography;near-field imaging;simulation results;integral equations;nonCartesian grid;Fourier domain","","46","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The test data include the motor efficiency using the IEC 34-2 and IEEE 112-B test standards, and the quantification of the stray load losses (SLLs), using the IEEE 112-B method. In 125 cases, the test data include the efficiency computed with both methods. The aim of this paper was the quantification of the discrepancy between the two mentioned standards, and to establish an approximate method to allow the comparison between motors tested with the two standards. Based on the significant number of collected motor data sets, it was concluded that, when compared to the IEEE 112-B standard, the IEC 34-2 standard is less accurate, and gives typically higher efficiency values, mainly because of the SLLs estimation procedure. The IEEE 112-B SLLs computed values are typically higher than the IEC SLLs predefined values, on average of 1.0 and 0.8 percentage points for 50-Hz and 60-Hz motors, respectively. Also, the average SLLs values vary slightly with the motor power. Using efficiency measurements made with both standards on the same motors, it was possible to confirm that the SLLs are the main reason for the observed discrepancy in the efficiency values. The results of the analysis carried out in this paper offer the possibility of comparing the efficiency of motors tested under the IEC 34-2 standard with motors tested with IEEE 112-B, leading to a choice of the most cost-effective option. This paper also provides a key contribution to the ongoing revision of the IEC 34-2 standard.","1939-9367","","10.1109/28.993186","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=993186","","IEC standards;Testing;Induction motors;Power measurement;Loss measurement;Measurement standards;Mechanical variables measurement;Electric variables measurement;Manufacturing;Electric motors","squirrel cage motors;machine testing;IEC standards;IEEE standards;standardisation;loss measurement;measurement standards","IEEE 112-B;IEC 34-2;efficiency testing standards;stray load losses;LV three-phase cage induction motors;motor efficiency;quantification;efficiency measurements;1 to 500 hp;0.75 to 375 kW;50 Hz;60 Hz","","42","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then the labels are adjusted with a shape detection method based on large regional context information to produce meaningful results. This approach makes use of knowledge of the blood cell structure.

These electrons spend about a half of their energy on ionization cascades, in contrast to low-energy (1-3 eV) electrons in conventional discharges that dissipate most of their energy in nonionizing inelastic collisions. High-energy electrons can be injected into the gas as beams. Alternatively, they can be created in situ by applying a very strong electric field for a short time, with a repetition rate matching the rate of recombination. Analytical calculations show that the power budget in the high-voltage, repetitive pulse mode can be significantly lower than in the dc regime, but still much higher than in the case of electron beam ionization. For each pulse length, there exists an optimum electric field that minimizes the power budget. A detailed modeling of spatio-temporal dynamics of pulsed discharges reveal that voltage displacement into the cathode sheath plays a critical role. Fully coupled modeling of nonlocal kinetics of high- and low-energy electrons, ionization processes, charge particle transport, and electrodynamics was performed for a high-voltage pulse developing with a substantial pre-existing plasma. The kinetic modeling shows formation of a large group of high-energy electrons in high-voltage nanosecond pulse and dramatic increase in ionization rate.

Due to computational or communication constraints, at each time instant, one can select only one of the noisy sensors. The sensor scheduling problem involves designing algorithms for choosing dynamically at each time instant which sensor to select to provide the next measurement. Each measurement has an associated measurement cost. The problem is to select an optimal measurement scheduling policy to minimize a cost function of estimation errors and measurement costs. The optimal measurement policy is solved via stochastic dynamic programming. Sensor management issues and suboptimal scheduling algorithms are also presented.

Coll. of Eng., Burla, India; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","","2002","17","4","1140","1147","An integrated approach of radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy scheme with a genetic optimization of their parameters has been developed in this paper to design intelligent adaptive controllers for improving the transient stability performance of power systems. At the outset, this concept is applied to a simple device such as thyristor-controlled series capacitor (TCSC) connected in a single-machine infinite bus power system and is then extended to interline power-flow controller (IPFC) connected in a multimachine power system. The RBFNN uses single neuron architecture and its parameters are dynamically updated in an online fashion with TS-fuzzy scheme designed with only four rules and triangular membership function. The rules of the TS-fuzzy scheme are derived from the real- or reactive-power error and their derivatives either at the TCSC or IPFC buses depending on the device. Further, to implement this combined scheme only one coefficient in the TS-fuzzy rules needs to be optimized. The optimization of this coefficient as well as the coefficient for auxiliary signal generation is performed through genetic algorithm. The performance of the new controller is evaluated in single-machine and multimachine power systems subjected to various transient disturbances. The new genetic-neuro-fuzzy control scheme exhibits a superior damping performance as well as a greater critical clearing time in comparison to the existing PI and RBFNN controller with updating of its parameters through the extended Kalman filter (EKF). Its simple architecture reduces the computational burden, thereby making it attractive for real-time implementation.

Requirements engineering is a task difficult enough when done locally-but it is even more difficult when cross-functional stakeholder groups specify requirements across cultural, language and time zone boundaries. This paper reports on a field study that investigated RE challenges introduced by stakeholders' geographical distribution in a multi-site organization. The goal was to examine RE practice in global software development, to formulate recommendations for improvement as well as to provide directions for future research on methods and tools. Based on the empirical evidence, we have constructed a model of how remote communication and knowledge management, cultural diversity and time differences negatively impact on requirements gathering, negotiation and specification. Findings reveal that aspects such as a lack of a common understanding of requirements, together with reduced awareness of working local context, trust level and ability to share work artifacts significantly challenge the effective collaboration of remote stakeholders in negotiating a set of requirements that satisfies geographically distributed customers. The paper concludes with recommendations for improving RE practice in this setting.","1090-705X","0-7695-1465-0","10.1109/ICRE.2002.1048545","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1048545","","Australia;Computer industry;Programming;Cultural differences;Collaborative software;Information analysis;Performance analysis;Software development management;Technology management;Engineering management","formal specification;groupware;software engineering;human factors","stakeholder geographical distribution;requirements management;software industry globalization;requirements engineering;RE;multisite software development organizations;cross-functional stakeholder groups;cultural boundaries;language boundaries;time zone boundaries;remote communication;knowledge management;cultural diversity;time differences","","69","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The consistent landmark and intensity registration algorithm produces good correspondences between images near landmark locations by matching corresponding landmarks and away from landmark locations by matching the image intensities. In contrast to similar unidirectional algorithms, these new consistent algorithms jointly estimate the forward and reverse transformation between two images while minimizing the inverse consistency error-the error between the forward (reverse) transformation and the inverse of the the reverse (forward) transformation. This reduces the ambiguous correspondence between the forward and reverse transformations associated with large inverse consistency errors. In both algorithms a thin-plate spline (TPS) model is used to regularize the estimated transformations. Two-dimensional (2-D) examples are presented that show the inverse consistency error produced by the traditional unidirectional landmark TPS algorithm can be relatively large and that this error is minimized using the consistent landmark algorithm. Results using 2-D magnetic resonance imaging data are presented that demonstrate that using landmark and intensity information together produce better correspondence between medical images than using either landmarks or intensity information alone.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2002.1009381","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1009381","","Image registration;Spline;Cities and towns;Two dimensional displays;Magnetic resonance imaging;Biomedical imaging;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Interpolation","splines (mathematics);image registration;medical image processing;biomedical MRI","consistent landmark registration;deformable templates;inverse transformation;intensity-based image registration;medical diagnostic imaging;ambiguous correspondence;reverse transformation;forward transformation;thin-plate spline model;estimated transformations regularization;inverse consistency error minimization;unidirectional landmark algorithm;2-D magnetic resonance imaging data","Algorithms;Brain;Computer Simulation;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","241","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An actual system is then analyzed to find out new performance requirements from the recloser to be able to coordinate with the fuse in the new system configuration. It is shown that traditional reclosers are unable to meet these requirements. It is further shown that microprocessor-based reclosers are fully competent to meet all requirements. As an example, one such actual recloser is used to successfully coordinate with a fuse under worst possible fault conditions. A method to choose recloser curves to achieve coordination is also stated.

The methodology can be applied to devices at the anticipated operational and environmental temperatures. The new technique makes use of differences in the thermal expansion coefficient between the thin beam and the substrate. The residual stress distribution is determined by matching the thermal deflections from a finite element model (FEM) to measured deflections of the beam. All previous residual stress measurement methods for MEMS suspended structures reported a uniformly distributed residual stress. Experimental data coupled with the new analytical method suggests that this may not be adequate for the case of a suspended thin structure with nonplanar surface topology. A stress gradient through the thickness must be included in the determination of the stress state of the beam. The new method indicates a spatially varying residual stress distribution and is capable of de-coupling the mean stress and the stress gradient through the thickness. It was found through an extensive literature review that the quantification of the stress gradient in a thin suspended structure has never been reported. The de-coupling makes the prediction of the stress state at different temperature points possible. Details of the new method are demonstrated and discussed by the use of a capacitive radio frequency (RF) MEMS switch.","1941-0158","","10.1109/JMEMS.2002.800936","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1022841","","Residual stresses;Stress measurement;Micromechanical devices;Temperature;Radio frequency;Microelectromechanical systems;Thermal expansion;Thermal stresses;Finite element methods;Topology","micromechanical devices;stress measurement;thermal expansion;finite element analysis;microwave switches","MEMS thin fixed-fixed beam structure;in situ residual stress measurement;microelectromechanical systems;operational temperature;environmental temperature;thermal expansion coefficient;thermal deflections;finite element model;suspended thin structure;nonplanar surface topology;stress gradient;beam stress state;spatially varying residual stress distribution;capacitive RF MEMS switch;thermal expansion mismatch","","55","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Until recently, extending the technique to dynamic tasks, such as lifting, has not been possible due to the nonstationarity of the EMG signals. Recent developments in time-frequency analysis procedures to compute the instantaneous median frequency (IMDF) were utilized in this study to overcome these limitations. Healthy control subjects with no history of LBP (n=9; mean age 26.3/spl plusmn/6.7) were instrumented for acquisition of surface EMG data from six electrodes on the thoraco-lumbar region and whole-body kinematic data from a stereo-photogrammetric system. Data were recorded during a standardized repetitive lifting task (load=15% body mass; 12 lifts/min; 5-min duration). The task resulted in significant decreases in IMDF for six of the nine subjects, with a symmetrical pattern of fatigue among contralateral muscles and greater decrements in the lower lumbar region. For those subjects with a significant decrease in IMDF, a lower limb and/or upper limb biomechanical adaptation to fatigue was observed during the task. Increases in the peak box acceleration were documented. In two subjects, the acceleration doubled its value from the beginning to the end of the exercise, which lead to a significant increase in the torque at L4/L5. This observation suggests an association between muscle fatigue at the lumbar region and the way the subject manipulates the box during the exercise. Fatigue-related biomechanical adaptations are discussed as a possible supplement to functional capacity assessments among patients with LBP.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2002.1021585","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1021585","","Electromyography;Biomechanics;Muscles;Fatigue;Acceleration;Pain;Time frequency analysis;Control systems;History;Instruments","time-frequency analysis;electromyography;biomechanics;medical signal processing;kinematics;photogrammetry","surface EMG signal changes;motion biomechanics;repetitive lifting task;isometric constant-force contractions;muscle deficits assessment;functional capacity assessments;electrodiagnostics;symmetrical fatigue pattern;lower lumbar region;contralateral muscles;stereo-photogrammetric system;body mass;peak box acceleration;thoraco-lumbar region;whole-body kinematic data;26.3 y;5 min","Adaptation, Biological;Adult;Algorithms;Back;Electromyography;Humans;Lifting;Male;Movement;Muscle Fatigue;Muscle, Skeletal;Posture;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Weight-Bearing","53","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

No.02TH8617)","","2002","","","1","7","Packaging of MEMS has been identified as one of the most significant areas of research for enabling MEMS usage in product applications by among others USA's NSF. In order to make MEMS a real-life opportunity, it is vital to explore and develop an understanding of the possibilities and limitations of MEMS packaging and reliability. Today's MEMS packaging can be divided into two very different approaches, protection at wafer level and protection at package level. To protect MEMS functions at package level places the responsibility and package selection in the hands of traditional military style, robust and preferably hermetic technologies. This is a branch of packaging industry in rapid decrease and the main trend in military and other high reliability electronics is to turn to packaging with less performance requirements, so called Commercial Off The Shelf, COTS, electronics. Wafer level packaging and protection of MEMS structures at wafer fabrication opens up the possibility of using either very low cost packaging that are not hermetic, such as plastic packages, or tailored RF packaging with optimized performance from an electromagnetic standpoint. Furthermore there is a potential for significant cost savings at the packaging subcontractor if the wafer level protected chip to be packaged is kept as similar to microelectronics chips as possible. It is obvious that quite a few MEMS functions are realized without any consideration for the packaging of the product. There is one so called one-stop shop for MEMS which proudly presents suggestions using packages that have been outdated in commercial products since the mid 1980s, claiming to target the mobile phone market. Another example is the large semiconductor company which has developed relays that would be ready for market, but are delayed for about one year due to lack of appropriate packaging. The prevailing opinion that MEMS packaging is expensive perhaps holds MEMS developers back from approaching packaging at earlier stages in product development. It is vital to make sure that the proper demands of the application are made clear, especially when hermetic packaging is claimed to be needed. Maybe the correct requirement is really a dry package or a constant atmosphere.","","0-7803-7434-7","10.1109/ISAPM.2002.990357","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=990357","","Micromechanical devices;Wafer scale integration;Electronics packaging;Protection;Semiconductor device packaging;Plastic packaging;Consumer electronics;Industrial electronics;Robustness;Defense industry","micromechanical devices;packaging;reliability","MEMS;reliability;COTS electronics;plastic packaging;wafer-level packaging;RF packaging;hermetic packaging","","17","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Graphics and security: exploring visual biometrics","K. L. Kroeker","NA","IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","","2002","22","4","16","21","Biometrics technology has come a long way from simpler forms of systems security. But are biometrics-based systems more secure or do they simply require crackers to become more proficient at breaking into systems? To recognize your fingerprint requires that a template of your fingerprint actually be present in the system that verifies your access. If you want to pass as somebody else, presumably you'd have to either have that person's finger with you or you'd need to change the verifying template residing in the system that verifies your print. Cracking into a system and replacing a legitimate print with your own isn't easy to do unless the system's security is poor. While biometric proponents stress the strength of their proprietary technologies or biometrics in general, no system is ever completely secure. Contrary to what many biometric proponents would have us believe-that biometric security outclasses traditional forms of security-all biometric systems are, after all, another form of computer security with its own set of strengths and weaknesses. Biometrics effectively trade some amount of privacy and cost effectiveness for ultimate convenience-and these systems are certainly no less secure than standard password systems. Password systems are cheap. Complex biometric scanning equipment is usually expensive. But biometrics seems to be where the industry is headed.","1558-1756","","10.1109/MCG.2002.1016693","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1016693","","Graphics;Biometrics;Face detection;Humans;Image databases;Smart cards;Acceleration;Authentication;Protocols;Cameras","biometrics (access control);image recognition","visual biometrics;face recognition;fingerprint recognition;iris recognition;security","","6","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

We use here a spectral-domain analysis for analytical modeling of the probe transition, where the probe is approximated by a current strip of an equivalent width. Applying the method of image, the structure is transformed to an infinite-long thin strip inside a dielectric slab, which reduces the transition analysis into a simpler planar geometry. Basic characteristics of the probe excitation, and a complete design data for the radiation loss, excitation efficiency, and input impedance for various transition parameters are computed. Prototype design experiments were conducted, which show that quite efficient excitation can be achieved using; the probe, with insertion loss as low as 0.1 dB.

International Conference on Power System Technology","","2002","1","","433","437 vol.1","The deregulation of the electric sector has involved the restructuring and privatization of many power systems and consequently the electric markets are essentially competitive. Power quality, economy, reliability and security are some of the main issues of the current power systems. In order to meet those objectives some advanced analysis methods must be adopted. Thus, the conventional deterministic power flow program (PF) may be enhanced with the incorporation of uncertainties in the generation and loads. An extension of the PF is the fuzzy power flow (FPF), which may be used to obtain efficient and extended diagnostics of the power system operation for planning applications. The PF may not be able to foresee some extreme cases of operation that do not correspond with the maximum and minimum loading limits. In this paper the considerations for the application of the fuzzy power flow for the planning and operation of practical power systems are discussed. Special attention is given to the nonlinearity of the power flow problem taking into account uncertainty and the linking with a voltage stability function based on the use of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. All of these concepts have been implemented in the commercial grade interactive power flow program WINFLU that is an official tool in the Peruvian electrical sector. Tests results using a configuration of the Peruvian interconnected power system (SEIN) are included and they demonstrate the validity of the fuzzy concepts as applied to a more robust planning and operation of this power system.","","0-7803-7459-2","10.1109/ICPST.2002.1053580","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1053580","","Power system planning;Fuzzy systems;Load flow;Power system reliability;Power system security;Power system analysis computing;Power system stability;Power system interconnection;Uncertainty;Industrial power systems","load flow;power system planning;power system interconnection;power system analysis computing;fuzzy set theory","fuzzy power flow;power system operation;power system planning;electric sector deregulation;electric sector restructuring;electric sector privatization;load flow analysis;interconnected power systems;power quality;power system economy;power system reliability;power system security;deterministic power flow program;minimum loading limits;maximum loading limits;voltage stability function;eigenvectors;eigenvalues;WINFLU interactive power flow program;Peruvian electrical sector;Peruvian interconnected power system;robust planning;robust operation","","14","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"The relationship between information technology use and buyer-supplier relationships: an exploratory analysis of the buying firm's perspective","A. S. Carr; L. R.

Concurrently, buyer-supplier relationships are changing. The purpose of this research is to determine if there is a relationship between the use of information technology and buyer-supplier relationships. A brief review of the literature on the use of information technology in purchasing is provided. Next, the nature of buyer-supplier relationships is discussed. Triangulation-involving field interviews followed by a mail survey-was used to collect data and attempt to answer the three research questions. The three questions were the following. (1) What is the relationship between the use of information technology and frequency of information shared between buyers and suppliers? (2) What is the relationship between the use of information technology and the richness of information shared between buyers and suppliers? (3) What is the relationship between the use of information technology and buyer-supplier trust? Information technology is defined in terms of automated purchasing systems, supplier links via electronic data interchange, information systems and computer-to-computer links with key suppliers. The research results suggest that three of the different types of information technology were significantly related to the frequency of information shared among buyers. Two of the different types of information technology were significantly related to the richness of information shared. However, only one of the types of information technology appears to be significantly related to trust among buyers and suppliers.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2002.803389","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1046062","","Information technology;Management;Electronic data interchange","information technology;purchasing;management;electronic data interchange","buyer-supplier relationships;exploratory analysis;information technology;purchasing process;information sharing;information richness;buyer-supplier trust;automated purchasing systems;supplier links;electronic data interchange;information systems;computer-to-computer links","","46","","42","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This channel model assumes that each multipath component of the propagating signal undergoes only one bounce traveling from the transmitter to the receiver and that scattering objects are located uniformly within a circle around the mobile. This geometrically based single bounce macrocell (GBSBM) channel model provides three important parameters that characterize a channel: the power of the multipath components, the time-of-arrival (TOA) of the components, and the AOA of the components. Using the GBSBM model, we analyze the effect of directional antennas at the base station on the fading envelopes. The level crossing rate of the fading envelope is reduced and the envelope correlation increases significantly if a directional antenna is employed at the base station.","1558-0857","","10.1109/26.990911","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=990911","","Macrocell networks;Solid modeling;Directional antennas;Base stations;Fading;Statistical analysis;Testing;Adaptive arrays;Transmitters;Scattering","radiowave propagation;fading channels;multipath channels;statistical analysis;directive antennas;electromagnetic wave scattering;correlation methods;direction-of-arrival estimation","geometrical-based statistical macrocell channel model;mobile environments;angle-of-arrival statistics;AOA statistics;multipath components;adaptive array algorithms;transmitter;receiver;scattering objects;geometrically based single bounce macrocell model;time-of-arrival;GBSBM model;directional antennas;base station;fading envelopes;level crossing rate;envelope correlation","","179","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"A feasible user story tool for agile software development?","M. J. Rees","Sch. of Inf. Technol., Bond Univ., Gold Coast, Qld., Australia","Ninth Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference, 2002.","","2002","","","22","30","User stories form the heart of the Extreme Programming methodology planning game. In its turn, Extreme Programming is one of the supporting pillars of the wider agile software development process. The user stories form a set of central work products that determine the software development processes. In the spirit of Extreme Programming the production of user stories is kept as simple as possible. Traditionally, user stories are hand written on index cards as they are easy to store, display, rearrange and distribute to the co-located development team. However, virtually all other work products of an application development team are in electronic format, and agile software development is increasingly being adopted by teams working from remote locations. In these circumstances distributed development teams look to software solutions for creating and using user stories. This paper surveys some of the tools that are being used and examines their suitability for the task using a set of requirements. As a result of this investigation the author has produced a prototype user story software tool for Agile Software Development called DotStories. The paper concludes by discussing the features of DotStories and its how closely it can approach the ideal user story software tool. Indeed, the proposition that software tools can ever improve on index cards is considered in the light of experience to date.","1530-1362","0-7695-1850-8","10.1109/APSEC.2002.1182972","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1182972","","Programming;Production;Software tools;Application software;Information technology;Bonding;Heart;Technology planning;Displays;Team working","formal specification;software engineering;software development management;software tools","extreme programming methodology;agile software development process;application development team;distributed development teams;DotStories;software development","","14","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we first discuss the features that a practical digital watermarking system for ownership verification requires. Besides perceptual invisibility and robustness, we claim that the private control of the watermark is also very important. Second, we present a novel wavelet-based watermarking algorithm.

The DG may have a positive impact on reliability through faster system restoration following a fault. The DG can also improve reliability for the owner, and may reduce the severity of voltage sags near the DG. Indices normalized to the number of customers dilute these positive benefits. The DG often has a negative impact on reliability indices through sympathetic tripping, required changes to utility overcurrent device settings, and increased fuse blowing. The utility cannot assume DG automatically improves system reliability, and action may be required to ensure that reliability does not actually degrade for other customers.","","0-7803-7470-3","10.1109/REPCON.2002.1002301","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1002301","","Distributed control;Power quality;Power system reliability;Voltage;Power generation economics;Environmental economics;Substations;Investments;USA Councils;Power system restoration","power supply quality;power system relaying;electric power generation;power distribution reliability;power system restoration","distributed generation impact;reliability indices;power quality indices;feeder capacity limit;standard indices;system restoration;voltage sags severity reduction;utility reclosing;fuse blowing;sympathetic tripping;voltage sags;system restoration operations","","35","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this case, they need to be able to replan quickly as their knowledge of the terrain changes. Stentz' Focussed Dynamic A* is a heuristic search method that repeatedly determines a shortest path from the current robot coordinates to the goal coordinates while the robot moves along the path. It is able to replan one to two orders of magnitudes faster than planning from scratch since it modifies previous search results locally. Consequently, it has been extensively used in mobile robotics. In this paper, we introduce an alternative to Focussed Dynamic A* that implements the same navigation strategy but is algorithmically different. Focussed Dynamic A* Lite is simpler, easier to understand, easier to analyze and easier to extend than Focussed Dynamic A*, yet is more efficient. We believe that our results will make D*-like replanning algorithms even more popular and enable robotics researchers to adapt them to additional applications.","","0-7803-7272-7","10.1109/ROBOT.2002.1013481","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1013481","","Navigation;Robot kinematics;Mobile robots;Motion planning;Costs;Land vehicles;Software prototyping;Prototypes;Educational institutions;Search methods","path planning;search problems;mobile robots;directed graphs","fast replanning;robot navigation;unknown terrain;mobile robots;Focussed Dynamic A* heuristic search method;shortest path;Focussed Dynamic A* Lite;D*-like replanning algorithms","","107","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper will demonstrate a painstaking optimization of key process and device geometrical parameters to maximize the benefits of the double-RESURF phenomenon in order to achieve the lowest on-resistance possible with the desired breakdown voltage.","","0-7803-7318-9","10.1109/ISPSD.2002.1016190","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1016190","","Implants;MOSFETs;Low voltage;Conductivity;Breakdown voltage;Voltage control;Integrated circuit technology;Regulators;Design methodology;MOS devices","power integrated circuits;MOS integrated circuits;semiconductor device breakdown;MOSFET;circuit optimisation;integrated circuit layout","double-RESURF n-channel LDMOS;on-resistance;device layout;charge balance;optimization;device geometrical parameters;lateral double-diffused MOS transistor;breakdown voltage;high voltage integrated circuit chip;HVIC;700 V","","5","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Mobile IPv6 is designed to manage mobile nodes' movements between wireless IPv6 networks. Nevertheless, the active communications of a mobile node are interrupted until the handover completes. Therefore, several extensions to Mobile IPv6 have been proposed to reduce the handover latency and the number of lost packets. We describe two of them, hierarchical Mobile IPv6, which manages local movements into a domain, and fast handover protocol, which allows the use of layer 2 triggers to anticipate the handover. We expose the specific handover algorithms proposed by all these methods. We also evaluate the handover latency over IEEE 802.11b wireless LAN. We compare the layer 2 and layer 3 handover latency in the Mobile IPv6 case in order to show the saving of time expected by using anticipation. We conclude by showing how to adapt the IEEE 802.11b control frames to set up such anticipation.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2002.1024413","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1024413","","Intelligent networks;Delay;Wireless LAN;Mobile communication;Wireless networks;Streaming media;Communication system control;Wireless communication;Wireless application protocol;Multimedia systems","transport protocols;wireless LAN;IEEE standards;telecommunication standards;delays;land mobile radio;computer network management","handover management;mobile nodes;Mobile IPv6;wireless IPv6 networks;handover latency reduction;hierarchical Mobile IPv6;fast handover protocol;layer 2 triggers;handover algorithms;IEEE 802.11b wireless LAN;layer 3 handover latency;layer 2 handover latency;IEEE 802.11b control frames;anticipation","","132","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

An algorithm is proposed which detects speech pauses by adaptively tracking minima in a noisy signal's power envelope both for the broadband signal and for the high-pass and low-pass filtered signal. In poor signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), the proposed algorithm maintains a low false-alarm rate in the detection of speech pauses while the standardized algorithm of ITU G.729 shows an increasing false-alarm rate in unfavorable situations. These characteristics are found with different types of noise and indicate that the proposed algorithm is better suited to be used for noise estimation in noise reduction algorithms, as speech deterioration may thus be kept at a low level. It is shown that in connection with the Ephraim-Malah (1984) noise reduction scheme, the speech pause detection performance can even be further increased by using the noise-reduced signal instead of the noisy signal as input for the speech pause decision unit.","1558-2353","","10.1109/89.985548","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=985548","","Speech enhancement;Spectral analysis;Noise reduction;Noise level;Detection algorithms;Additive noise;Background noise;Adaptive signal detection;Envelope detectors;Adaptive filters","speech enhancement;spectral analysis;acoustic noise;tracking;interference suppression;estimation theory","speech pause detection;noise spectrum estimation;tracking;power envelope dynamics;single-microphone noise reduction schemes;enhancement;speech signals;additive noise;background noise;broadband signal;high-pass filtered signal;low-pass filtered signal;signal-to-noise ratios;false-alarm rate;ITU G.729;noise estimation;speech deteriorations;Ephraim-Malah noise reduction scheme;noise-reduced signal","","121","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper shows how a previously published method based on Monte Carlo simulation can be enhanced to take into account time-dependent phenomena (TDP) such as cascade tripping of elements due to overloads, malfunction of the protection system, and potential power system instabilities.

A dynamic programming model has been developed to optimize the number of generating units in operation at each hour of the day in order to attain the total generation scheduling of the plant in the most economic way. The model highlights the tradeoff between start-up/shut-down of generating units and hydro power efficiency, taking into account variations in tailrace elevation, penstock head losses and turbine-generator efficiencies. The methodology has been tested for a typical generation scheduling, and the results show that the number of the turbine-generator sets dispatched has a major influence on the overall hydroplant efficiency, and therefore it is a key aspect to be considered in the dispatch of hydro generating units.

This paper studies RMT techniques in the context of both single- and dual-processor simultaneous multi-threaded (SMT) single-chip devices. Using a detailed, commercial-grade, SMT processor design we uncover subtle RMT implementation complexities, and find that RMT can be a more significant burden for single-processor devices than prior studies indicate.

The interacting multiple model (IMM) Kalman filter provides a powerful framework for performing the tracking of both the motion as well as the shape of these subjects. The tracking system utilizes a simple geometric shape primitive such as an ellipse to define a bounding extent of the subject.

Regardless of all the work, it appears that a thorough comparison of the drive behavior under PI and FL speed control is still missing. This paper attempts to fill in this gap, by providing an in-depth comparison of operation of a vector-controlled permanent-magnet synchronous motor, using at first an experimental rig. Speed responses, obtained under PI and FL speed control, are recorded and compared for a variety of operating conditions. The transients studied include response to a large step speed command from standstill with nominal inertia and an increased inertia, response to small step speed reference change, and response to step load torque application. The transient behavior is examined for various initial speed settings, so that a thorough comparison is enabled. Experimental results are further supplemented with a set of simulation results, obtained using a different permanent-magnet machine and a different FL controller.

Today, color TFT (Thin-Film Transistor) LCDs are common even in cost-effective equipments. An LCD display system is composed of an LCD panel, a frame buffer memory, an LCD and frame buffer controller, and a backlight inverter and lamp. All of them are heavy power consumers, and their portion becomes much more dominant when running interactive applications. This is because interactive applications are often triggered by human inputs and thus result in a lot of slack time in the CPU and memory system, which can be effectively used for dynamic power management. In this paper, we introduce low-power LCD display schemes as a system-level approach. We accurately characterize the energy consumption at the component level and minimize energy consumption of each component without appreciable display quality degradation.

But why should we want to transmit reactive power anyway? Is it not just a troublesome concept, invented by the theoreticians, that is best disregarded? The answer is that reactive power is consumed not only by most of the network elements, but also by most of the consumer loads, so it must be supplied somewhere.

Eng., MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2002","3","1","60","74","This paper extends the A* methodology to shortest path problems in dynamic networks, in which arc travel times are time dependent. We present efficient adaptations of the A* algorithm for computing fastest (minimum travel time) paths from one origin node to one destination node, for one as well as multiple departure times at the origin node, in a class of dynamic networks the link travel times of which satisfy the first-in-first-out property. We summarize useful properties of dynamic networks and develop improved lower bounds on minimum travel times. These lower bounds are exploited in designing efficient adaptations of the A* algorithm to solve instances of the one-to-one dynamic fastest path problem. The developed algorithms are implemented and their computational performance is analyzed experimentally. The performance of the computer implementations of the adaptations of the A* algorithm are compared to a dynamic adaptation of Dijkstra's algorithm, stopped when the destination node is selected. Comparative computational results obtained demonstrate that the algorithms of this paper are efficient. Using a network containing 3000 nodes, 10 000 links, and 100 time intervals, the dynamic adaptations of the A* led to a savings ratio of 11, in terms of number of nodes selected, and to a savings ratio of five in terms of computation time. The effect of the network size on the performance of these adaptations is also studied. It is shown that the computational savings in term of both the number of nodes selected and the computation time, increase with the size of the network topology.","1558-0016","","10.1109/6979.994796","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=994796","","Computer networks;Shortest path problem;Intelligent transportation systems;Intelligent networks;Heuristic algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Computational intelligence;Application software;Context modeling;Vehicle dynamics","computational complexity;transportation;discrete time systems;graph theory","shortest path problems;dynamic networks;arc travel times;minimum travel time;A* algorithm;intelligent transportation systems;transportation","","140","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In response to these growing pressures, there has been a call for HEIs to improve operational efficiency and to reduce duplication of resources by implementing advanced information systems that span the institution and improve processes. In response, HEIs have turned their efforts to implementing complex enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. These systems are seen as the solution to address the growing governmental information requirements and to improve competitiveness, but do these systems represent a viable proposition for the diverse higher education sector with its traditionally strong and fragmented structure and culture? This paper investigates whether ERP systems offer a feasible information systems strategy for HEIs, using a 'critical success factor' model. Four in-depth case studies were conducted in HEIs that were in the process of implementing ERP systems. Numerous complexities, especially cultural and political ones, arose in light of the traditional structure of HEIs. The findings suggest that a careful use of communication and change management procedures to handle the business process reengineering (BPR) impact of ERP systems can alleviate some of the problems, but a more fundamental issue concerning the cost feasibility of system integration, training and user licenses may, in the end, impede ERP system utilization.","","0-7695-1435-9","10.1109/HICSS.2002.994295","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=994295","","Enterprise resource planning;Information systems;Management training;Business process re-engineering;Information technology;Continuing education;Government;Cultural differences;Global communication;Business communication","educational administrative data processing;management information systems;business data processing;planning;politics;socio-economic effects","enterprise resource planning;critical success factors;contextual factors;public sector institutions;higher education institutions;information technologies;competition;government funding;operational efficiency;resource duplication;advanced information systems strategy;governmental information requirements;competitiveness;fragmented structure;culture;case studies;politics;communication procedures;change management procedures;business process reengineering;cost feasibility;system integration;training;user licenses;system utilization","","24","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The idea of whack-a-mole is that installation of an active or passive filter on the feeder makes voltage harmonics increase on some buses, whereas it makes voltage harmonics decrease on other buses, especially at the point of installation. The distributed-parameter representation is applied to a simplified feeder, thus making it possible to perform analysis of the whack-a-mole. As a result, this analysis yields such a basic way as to avoid the whack-a-mole.

Many evolving low-power sensor network scenarios need to have high spatial density to enable reliable operation in the face of component node failures as well as to facilitate high spatial localization of events of interest. This induces a high level of network data redundancy, where spatially proximal sensor readings are highly correlated. We propose a new way of removing this redundancy in a completely distributed manner, i.e., without the sensors needing to talk, to one another. Our constructive framework for this problem is dubbed DISCUS (distributed source coding using syndromes) and is inspired by fundamental concepts from information theory. We review the main ideas, provide illustrations, and give the intuition behind the theory that enables this framework.We present a new domain of collaborative information communication and processing through the framework on distributed source coding.

A load accepts electricity delivery from the generator with the lowest bid at its bid price as long as this price is not higher than the load's willingness to pay. Necessary and sufficient conditions of Nash equilibrium (NE) bidding strategy are derived based on a generic generating cost matrix and the loads' willingness to pay vector.

Its presence causes a degradation of some antenna parameters and, especially, the cross-polar level, which may rise by several tens of dB. It would then be useful to develop a technique to predict its influence, in order to take appropriate steps during antenna design. A heuristic model for the junction problem has previously been derived and validated with measurements in a time-domain physical optics (TD-PO) framework.

We investigate whether we can construct an adaptive signal processing device that learns by example how to generate new instances of a given musical style. Because recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can, in principle, learn the temporal structure of a signal, they are good candidates for such a task. Unfortunately, music composed by standard RNNs often lacks global coherence. The reason for this failure seems to be that RNNs cannot keep track of temporally distant events that indicate global music structure. Long short-term memory (LSTM) has succeeded in similar domains where other RNNs have failed, such as timing and counting and the learning of context sensitive languages. We show that LSTM is also a good mechanism for learning to compose music. We present experimental results showing that LSTM successfully learns a form of blues music and is able to compose novel (and we believe pleasing) melodies in that style. Remarkably, once the network has found the relevant structure, it does not drift from it: LSTM is able to play the blues with good timing and proper structure as long as one is willing to listen.","","0-7803-7616-1","10.1109/NNSP.2002.1030094","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1030094","","Intelligent networks;Multiple signal classification;Recurrent neural networks;Timing;Adaptive signal processing;Signal generators;Signal processing;Machine learning;Bars;Learning systems","music;learning by example;recurrent neural nets;adaptive signal processing;audio signal processing","music temporal structure;blues music;blues improvisation;long short-term memory;recurrent neural networks;feature extraction;nested periodicities;adaptive signal processing;learning by example;music composition;melodies","","36","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A least squares (LS) approach is proposed for the design of FIR VDFs by expressing the impulse response of the filter as a linear combination of basis functions. It is shown that the optimal LS solution can be obtained by solving a system of linear equations. By choosing the basis functions as piecewise polynomials, VDFs with larger tuning range than that of ordinary polynomial based approach results. The proposed VDF can be efficiently implemented using the familiar Farrow structure. Making use of the FIR VDF so obtained, an Eigensystem Realization Algorithm (ERA)-based model reduction technique is proposed to approximate the FIR VDF by a stable IIR VDF with lower system order. The advantages of the model reduction approach are: 1) it is computational simple which only requires the computation of the singular value decomposition of a Hankel matrix; 2) the IIR VDF obtained is guaranteed to be stable; and 3) the frequency response such as the phase response of the FIR prototype is well preserved. Apart from the above advantages, the proposed IIR VDF does not suffer from undesirable transient response during parameter tuning found in other approaches based on direct tuning of filter parameters. For frequency selective VDFs, about 40% of the multiplications can be saved using the IIR VDFs. The implementation of the proposed FIR VDF using sum-of-powers-of-two (SOPOT) coefficient and the multiplier block (MB) technique are also studied. Results show that about two-third of the additions in implementing the multiplication of the SOPOT coefficients can be saved using the multiplier block, which leads to significant savings in hardware complexity.","1558-125X","","10.1109/TCSII.2002.807574","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1177394","","Finite impulse response filter;Digital filters;Frequency;Tuning;IIR filters;Polynomials;Reduced order systems;Least squares methods;Nonlinear filters;Equations","IIR filters;FIR filters;network synthesis;least squares approximations;circuit tuning;reduced order systems;Hankel matrices;singular value decomposition;frequency response;polynomials","IIR digital filter;FIR digital filter;variable digital filter;linear equation;piecewise polynomial basis function;Farrow structure;Eigensystem Realization Algorithm;model reduction;Hankel matrix;singular value decomposition;frequency response;phase response;transient response;sum-of-powers-of-two coefficient;least squares design;multiplier block;tunable digital filter","","68","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We found that the hole trapping in the oxide cannot be responsible for all the enhanced low-dose-rate sensitivity (ELDRS) effects in SiO/sub 2/, and the contribution of protons is also essential. The dynamics of interface-trap formation are defined by the relation between the proton mobility (transport time of the protons across the oxide) and the time required for positive-charge buildup near the interface due to trapped holes. The analytically estimated and numerically calculated interface-trap densities were found to be in very good agreement with available experimental data.","1558-1578","","10.1109/TNS.2002.805387","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1134199","","Protons;Degradation;Laboratories;Space technology;Poisson equations;Analytical models;Interface phenomena;Radiation effects;Contracts","bipolar transistors;radiation effects;semiconductor device models;interface states;space charge;hole traps;ion mobility;space vehicle electronics","bipolar transistors;BJT;enhanced interface-trap formation;low dose rates;physical model;space-charge effects;base oxides;analytical models;free parameters;physical mechanisms;oxide-trap formation;hole trapping;enhanced low-dose-rate sensitivity;proton contribution;interface-trap formation dynamics;proton mobility;proton transport time;positive-charge buildup;space technology;lateral p-n-p transistors;Si-SiO/sub 2/ interface;Si-SiO/sub 2/","","135","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Analysis of the converter in discontinuous current conduction mode results in an expression for the duty cycle-power relationship. Using parameters of the mechanical system, the piezoelectric element, and the converter an optimal duty cycle can be determined where the harvested power is maximized for a given frequency of mechanical excitation. It is shown that, as the magnitude of the excitation increases, the optimal duty cycle becomes essentially constant, greatly simplifying the control of the step-down converter. The expression is validated with experimental data showing that the optimal duty cycle can be accurately determined and maximum energy harvesting attained.

The fractal dimension is a mathematical concept, which measures the geometrical complexity of an object. The algorithms for estimating the fractal dimension calculate a numerical value using as data a time series for the specific problem. This numerical (crisp) value gives an idea of the complexity of the geometrical object (or time series). However, there is an underlying uncertainty in the estimation of the fractal dimension because we use only a sample of points of the object, and also because the numerical algorithms for the fractal dimension are not completely accurate. For this reason, we have proposed a new definition of the fractal dimension that incorporates the concept of a fuzzy set. This new definition can be considered a weaker definition (but more realistic) of the fractal dimension, and we have named this the ""fuzzy fractal dimension."" We can apply this new definition of the fractal dimension in conjunction with soft computing techniques for the problem of time series prediction. We have developed hybrid intelligent systems combining neural networks, fuzzy logic, and the fractal dimension, for the problem of time series prediction, and we have achieved very good results.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2002.804316","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1058075","","Hybrid intelligent systems;Neural networks;Fuzzy logic;Fractals;Chaos;Fuzzy sets;Time factors;Fluctuations;Pattern analysis;Performance analysis","fuzzy logic;neural nets;backpropagation;computational complexity;time series","hybrid intelligent systems;time series prediction;neural networks;fuzzy logic;fractal theory;mathematical concept;geometrical complexity;complexity;numerical algorithms","","130","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, more than a decade after its initial proposal, IP multicast is still plagued with concerns pertaining to scalability, network management, deployment, and support for higher layer functionality such as error, flow, and congestion control. We explore an alternative architecture that we term end system multicast, where end systems implement all multicast related functionality including membership management and packet replication. This shifting of multicast support from routers to end systems has the potential to address most problems associated with IP multicast. However, the key concern is the performance penalty associated with such a model. In particular, end system multicast introduces duplicate packets on physical links and incurs larger end-to-end delays than IP multicast. We study these performance concerns in the context of the Narada protocol. In Narada, end systems self-organize into an overlay structure using a fully distributed protocol. Further, end systems attempt to optimize the efficiency of the overlay by adapting to network dynamics and by considering application level performance. We present details of Narada and evaluate it using both simulation and Internet experiments. Our results indicate that the performance penalties are low both from the application and the network perspectives. We believe the potential benefits of transferring multicast functionality from end systems to routers significantly outweigh the performance penalty incurred.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2002.803066","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1038577","","Computer aided software engineering;Multicast protocols;Error correction;Unicast;Proposals;Scalability;Delay;Switches;Web and internet services;Internetworking","Internet;telecommunication network routing;computer network management;transport protocols;telecommunication congestion control;multicast communication;delays;self-adjusting systems;performance evaluation","end system multicast;Internet protocol;protocol layer;IP multicast;network management;network scalability;higher layer functionality;congestion control;membership management;packet replication;network routers;end-to-end delays;Narada protocol;overlay structure;distributed protocol;network dynamics;application level performance;simulation;Internet experiments;performance penalties;self-organizing protocol","","482","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Advanced Process Control (APC) is becoming a critical component to improve performance, yield, throughput, and flexibility of the manufacturing process using run-to-run, wafer-to-wafer, within wafer and real-time process control. The complexity of device manufacturing process as well as the strong coupling effect of several input parameters on the final process outputs prohibit the use of a classical single variable feedback control method. Therefore, multivariate, model-based APC system is developed in conjunction with feed-forward and feedback mechanisms to automatically determine the optimal recipe for each wafer based on both incoming wafer and tool state properties. The APC system uses wafer metrology, process models and sophisticated control algorithms to provide dynamic fine-tuning of intermediate process targets that enhance final device targets. The design of the APC system enables scalable control solutions across a single chamber, a process tool, multi-tools, a process module and multi-process modules using similar building blocks, concepts and algorithms.","","0-7803-7158-5","10.1109/ASMC.2002.1001583","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1001583","","Process control;Manufacturing processes;Semiconductor device manufacture;Semiconductor device modeling;Automatic control;Monitoring;Production;Throughput;Feedback control;Feedforward systems","process control;feedback;feedforward;semiconductor device manufacture","semiconductor manufacturing;Advanced Process Control system;feedforward mechanism;wafer metrology;control algorithm;process tool;multivariate method;process model;process module;feedback mechanism;process control","","1","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, the high temperature characteristics of I/sub off/ with reverse body bias (V/sub B/) for the further reduction of the standby leakage are also demonstrated. The discussion is based on the data measured from three CMOS logic technologies (i.e., low-voltage and high performance (LV), low-power (LP), and ultra-low-power (ULP)) and three generations (0.18 /spl mu/m, 0.15 /spl mu/m, and 0.13 /spl mu/m). Experiments show that the optimum V/sub B/, which minimizes I/sub off/, is a function of temperature. The experiments also show that for CMOS logic technologies of the next generations, it is important to control I/sub B-BTBT/ and I/sub GIDL/ by reducing effective doping concentration and doping gradient. It seems that in order to conform on-state gate leakage (I/sub G-on/) and I/sub EDT/ specifications and to retain a 10-20% performance improvement at the same time, it is indispensable to use high-quality and high-dielectric-constant materials to reduce effective oxide thickness (EOT). The role of each leakage component in SRAM standby current (I/sub SB/) is also analyzed.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2002.1003727","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1003727","","SRAM chips;Permittivity;Dielectric films;CMOS digital integrated circuits;Leakage currents;Integrated circuit design;Integrated circuit measurements","SRAM chips;doping profiles;permittivity;dielectric thin films;CMOS digital integrated circuits;leakage currents;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit measurement;low-power electronics","leakage scaling;SoC;CMOS technology scaling;high temperature characteristics;off-state drain leakage;subthreshold leakage;gate edge-direct-tunneling leakage;gate-induced drain-leakage;bulk band-to-band-tunneling leakage;reverse body bias;standby leakage;CMOS logic technologies;CMOS low-voltage technology;CMOS low-power technology;CMOS ultra-low-power technology;CMOS logic generations;effective doping concentration;doping gradient;on-state gate leakage;high-dielectric-constant materials;effective oxide thickness;leakage component;SRAM standby current;temperature dependence;25 to 125 C;0.18 micron;0.15 micron;0.13 micron","","37","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"32-bit cyclic redundancy codes for Internet applications","P. Koopman","Dept. of Electron. & Comput. Eng., Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA, USA","Proceedings International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks","","2002","","","459","468","Standardized 32-bit cyclic redundancy codes provide fewer bits of guaranteed error detection than they could, achieving a Hamming Distance (HD) of only 4 for maximum-length Ethernet messages, whereas HD=6 is possible. Although research has revealed improved codes, exploring the entire design space has previously been computationally intractable, even for special-purpose hardware. Moreover, no CRC polynomial has yet been found that satisfies an emerging need to attain both HD=6 for 12K bit messages and HD=4 for message lengths beyond 64 Kbits. This paper presents results from the first exhaustive search of the 32-bit CRC design space. Results from previous research are validated and extended to include identifying all polynomials achieving a better HD than the IEEE 802.3 CRC-32 polynomial. A new class of polynomials is identified that provides HD=6 up to nearly 16K bit and HD=4 up to 114K bit message lengths, providing the best achievable design point that maximizes error detection for both legacy and new applications, including potentially iSCSI and application-implemented error checks.","","0-7695-1597-5","10.1109/DSN.2002.1028931","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1028931","","Internet;Polynomials;Cyclic redundancy check;Ethernet networks;High definition video;Computer errors;Hamming distance;Hardware;Computer networks;Memory","cyclic codes;error detection codes;redundancy;local area networks;Internet;polynomials;error detection;IEEE standards;telecommunication standards","cyclic redundancy codes;Internet applications;guaranteed error detection;Hamming Distance;maximum-length Ethernet messages;special-purpose hardware;polynomial;IEEE 802.3;message lengths;error detection;iSCSI;application-implemented error checks;32 bit","","63","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Effect of Al inclusion in HfO2 on the physical and electrical properties of the dielectrics","W. J. Zhu; T. Tamagawa; M. Gibson; T. Furukawa; T. P. Ma","Yale Univ., New Haven, CT, USA; NA; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Electron Device Letters","","2002","23","11","649","651","This authors present the effect of Al inclusion in HfO/sub 2/ on the crystallization temperature, leakage current, band gap, dielectric constant, and border traps. It has been found that the crystallization temperature is significantly increased by adding Al into the HfO/sub 2/ film. With an addition of 31.7% Al, the crystallization temperature is about 400-500/spl deg/C higher than that without Al. This additional Al also results an increase of the band gap of the dielectric from 5.8 eV for HfO/sub 2/ without Al to 6.5 eV for HfAlO with 45.5% Al and a reduced dielectric constant from 19.6 for HfO/sub 2/ without Al to 7.4 for Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ without Hf. Considering the tradeoff among the crystallization temperature, band gap, and dielectric constant, we have concluded that the optimum Al concentration is about 30% for conventional self-aligned CMOS gate processing technology.","1558-0563","","10.1109/LED.2002.805000","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1097941","","Hafnium oxide;Crystallization;Temperature;Photonic band gap;Dielectric constant;CMOS technology;High-K gate dielectrics;Leakage current;X-ray scattering;Rapid thermal annealing","hafnium compounds;dielectric thin films;crystallisation;energy gap;permittivity;leakage currents;aluminium;semiconductor-insulator boundaries;CMOS integrated circuits;MOSFET","Al inclusion;HfO/sub 2/ dielectric film;crystallization temperature;leakage current;band gap;dielectric constant;border traps;self-aligned CMOS gate processing technology;high-k dielectrics;400 to 500 degC;6.5 eV;HfO/sub 2/;HfAlO","","210","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
