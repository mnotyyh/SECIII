"Rapid object detection using a boosted cascade of simple features","P. Viola; M. Jones","Mitsubishi Electr. Res. Labs., Cambridge, MA, USA; NA","Proceedings of the 2001 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. CVPR 2001","","2001","1","","I","I","This paper describes a machine learning approach for visual object detection which is capable of processing images extremely rapidly and achieving high detection rates. This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the ""integral image"" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a ""cascade"" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection.","1063-6919","0-7695-1272-0","10.1109/CVPR.2001.990517","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=990517","","Object detection;Face detection;Pixel;Detectors;Filters;Machine learning;Image representation;Focusing;Skin;Robustness","object detection;image classification;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction","rapid object detection;boosted simple feature cascade;machine learning;visual object detection;image processing;image representation;integral image;AdaBoost;classifiers;background regions;object specific focus-of-attention mechanism;statistical guarantees;face detection;real-time applications","","6681","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our model can detect objects whose boundaries are not necessarily defined by the gradient. We minimize an energy which can be seen as a particular case of the minimal partition problem. In the level set formulation, the problem becomes a ""mean-curvature flow""-like evolving the active contour, which will stop on the desired boundary. However, the stopping term does not depend on the gradient of the image, as in the classical active contour models, but is instead related to a particular segmentation of the image. We give a numerical algorithm using finite differences. Finally, we present various experimental results and in particular some examples for which the classical snakes methods based on the gradient are not applicable.

System protection and coordination serve to minimize damage to a system and its components, thereby limiting the extent and duration of any service interruption occurring on any portion of the system. The IEEE Buff Book deals with the proper selection, application, and coordination of the components that constitute system protection for industrial plants and commercial buildings. The IEEE Buff Book presents complete information on protection and coordination principles designed to protect industrial and commercial power systems against any abnormalities that could reasonably be expected to occur during the course of system operation. The information is arranged in a convenient step-by-step format for easy comprehension. It is a valuable sourcebook for use at the system design stage, as well as in the modification of existing operations for better system protection. The IEEE Buff Book supports the goal of system protection by efficiently isolating and removing problems. In achieving this goal, certain design features must be utilized. One of the main design features involves the rapid isolation of the affected portion of the system, while maintaining normal operation elsewhere. Another design feature reduces the short-circuit current to minimize damage to the system, its components, and the utilization equipment it supplies. Yet another design feature provides alternate circuits, automatic throwovers, and automatic reclosing devices. These design features for system protection are the focus of the IEEE Buff Book.

Starting from estimation-theoretic foundations of this problem, the paper proves that a solution to the SLAM problem is indeed possible. The underlying structure of the SLAM problem is first elucidated. A proof that the estimated map converges monotonically to a relative map with zero uncertainty is then developed. It is then shown that the absolute accuracy of the map and the vehicle location reach a lower bound defined only by the initial vehicle uncertainty. Together, these results show that it is possible for an autonomous vehicle to start in an unknown location in an unknown environment and, using relative observations only, incrementally build a perfect map of the world and to compute simultaneously a bounded estimate of vehicle location. The paper also describes a substantial implementation of the SLAM algorithm on a vehicle operating in an outdoor environment using millimeter-wave radar to provide relative map observations. This implementation is used to demonstrate how some key issues such as map management and data association can be handled in a practical environment. The results obtained are cross-compared with absolute locations of the map landmarks obtained by surveying. In conclusion, the paper discusses a number of key issues raised by the solution to the SLAM problem including suboptimal map-building algorithms and map management.","2374-958X","","10.1109/70.938381","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=938381","","Simultaneous localization and mapping;Remotely operated vehicles;Mobile robots;Navigation;Uncertainty;Millimeter wave radar;Motion planning;Environmental management;Helium;Mechatronics","mobile robots;path planning;covariance matrices;filtering theory;state estimation;estimation theory","simultaneous localization and map building problem;SLAM problem;autonomous vehicle;unknown location;unknown environment;absolute vehicle location;estimation-theoretic foundations;relative map;absolute accuracy;perfect map;outdoor environment;millimeter-wave radar;suboptimal map-building algorithms;map management","","1529","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Res., Princeton, NJ, USA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","","2001","23","11","1222","1239","Many tasks in computer vision involve assigning a label (such as disparity) to every pixel. A common constraint is that the labels should vary smoothly almost everywhere while preserving sharp discontinuities that may exist, e.g., at object boundaries. These tasks are naturally stated in terms of energy minimization. The authors consider a wide class of energies with various smoothness constraints. Global minimization of these energy functions is NP-hard even in the simplest discontinuity-preserving case. Therefore, our focus is on efficient approximation algorithms. We present two algorithms based on graph cuts that efficiently find a local minimum with respect to two types of large moves, namely expansion moves and swap moves. These moves can simultaneously change the labels of arbitrarily large sets of pixels. In contrast, many standard algorithms (including simulated annealing) use small moves where only one pixel changes its label at a time. Our expansion algorithm finds a labeling within a known factor of the global minimum, while our swap algorithm handles more general energy functions. Both of these algorithms allow important cases of discontinuity preserving energies. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for image restoration, stereo and motion. On real data with ground truth, we achieve 98 percent accuracy.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.969114","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=969114","","Labeling;Image restoration;Stereo vision;Minimization methods;Markov random fields;Energy measurement;Computer vision;Approximation algorithms;Simulated annealing;Motion estimation","computer vision;image restoration;minimisation;computational complexity;simulated annealing","fast approximate energy minimization;graph cuts;computer vision;common constraint;sharp discontinuities;object boundaries;energy minimization;smoothness constraints;global minimization;NP-hard;discontinuity-preserving case;approximation algorithms;local minimum;expansion moves;swap moves;arbitrarily large sets;standard algorithms;simulated annealing;expansion algorithm;global minimum;swap algorithm;general energy functions;discontinuity preserving energies;image restoration;ground truth;early vision;graph algorithms;minimum cut;maximum flow;Markov Random fields","","4433","","47","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To tackle that task, signal processing and analysis techniques have to be developed, while, at the same time, consolidating psychological and linguistic analyses of emotion.

"Segmentation of brain MR images through a hidden Markov random field model and the expectation-maximization algorithm","Y. Zhang; M. Brady; S. Smith","John Radcliffe Hosp., Oxford Univ., UK; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","","2001","20","1","45","57","The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a histogram-based model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation-no spatial information is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not the the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias field distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods produce unreliable results. Here, the authors propose a novel hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences of neighboring sites. Although MRF modeling has been employed in MR image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods are limited to using MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based approach. To fit the HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. The authors show that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into a HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved. More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be combined with other techniques. As an example, the authors show how the bias field correction algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997) can be incorporated into this framework to achieve a three-dimensional fully automated approach for brain MR image segmentation.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.906424","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=906424","","Hidden Markov models;Image segmentation;Brain modeling;Expectation-maximization algorithms;Mathematical model;Magnetic resonance;Noise level;Stochastic processes;State estimation;Robustness","hidden Markov models;image segmentation;biomedical MRI;medical image processing;brain","brain MR images segmentation;hidden Markov random field model;expectation-maximization algorithm;statistical segmentation;histogram-based model;well-defined images;low noise levels;bias field correction algorithm;three-dimensional fully automated approach;stochastic process;spatial information encoding;magnetic resonance imaging;medical diagnostic imaging","Algorithms;Brain;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Markov Chains","3421","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The resulting system has high-efficiency, lower-cost and can be easily modified to handle more energy sources (e.g., wind-generators).

The new transition allows a complete integration of waveguide components on substrate with MICs and MMICs.","1558-1764","","10.1109/7260.914305","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=914305","","Microstrip;Planar waveguides;Rectangular waveguides;Waveguide transitions;Dielectric substrates;Metallization;Tellurium;Waveguide theory;Integrated circuit interconnections;Bandwidth","microstrip transitions;rectangular waveguides;Q-factor;microstrip circuits;millimetre wave integrated circuits;microwave integrated circuits","planar platform;microstrip line;rectangular waveguide;fully integrated;simple taper interconnected;effective bandwidth;in-band insertion loss;microstrip to waveguide transition;LTCC platform;tapered microstrip;quasi-TEM mode;TE/sub 10/ mode;FEM;MIC integration;MMIC integration;28 GHz","","1051","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although excellent current-voltage (I-V) characteristics and record high output power densities at microwave frequencies have been achieved, the origin of the 2DEG and the factors limiting the output power and reliability of the devices under high power operation remain uncertain. Drain current collapse has been the major obstacle in the development of reliable high power devices. We show that the cause of current collapse is a charging up of a second virtual gate, physically located in the gate drain access region. Due to the large bias voltages present on the device during a microwave power measurement, surface states in the vicinity of the gate trap electrons, thus acting as a negatively charged virtual gate. The maximum current available from a device during a microwave power measurement is limited by the discharging of this virtual gate. Passivated devices located adjacent to unpassivated devices on the same wafer show almost no current collapse, thus demonstrating that proper surface passivation prevents the formation of the virtual gate. The possible mechanisms by which a surface passivant reduces current collapse and the factors affecting reliability and stability of such a passivant are discussed.","1557-9646","","10.1109/16.906451","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=906451","","Aluminum compounds","aluminium compounds;gallium compounds;III-V semiconductors;wide band gap semiconductors;power HEMT;microwave power transistors;microwave field effect transistors;semiconductor device reliability;surface states;electron traps;passivation;stability;semiconductor device measurement;two-dimensional electron gas","surface states;DC characteristics;RF characteristics;AlGaN/GaN HFETs;high power operation;microwave frequencies;2DEG;reliability;output power;drain current collapse;reliable high power devices;virtual gate charging;gate drain access region;bias voltages;electron traps;negatively charged virtual gate;microwave power measurement;virtual gate discharging;passivated devices;surface passivation;virtual gate formation prevention;stability;HEMT;MODFET;AlGaN-GaN","","909","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We enumerate and classify many of these variants, and evaluate their effect on the speed with which the correct alignment is reached. In order to improve convergence for nearly-flat meshes with small features, such as inscribed surfaces, we introduce a new variant based on uniform sampling of the space of normals. We conclude by proposing a combination of ICP variants optimized for high speed.

Our theoretical analysis of the codes is based on the work of Richardson and Urbanke (see ibid., vol.47, no.2, p.599-618, 2000). Assuming that the underlying communication channel is symmetric, we prove that the probability densities at the message nodes of the graph possess a certain symmetry. Using this symmetry property we then show that, under the assumption of no cycles, the message densities always converge as the number of iterations tends to infinity. Furthermore, we prove a stability condition which implies an upper bound on the fraction of errors that a belief-propagation decoder can correct when applied to a code induced from a bipartite graph with a given degree distribution. Our codes are found by optimizing the degree structure of the underlying graphs. We develop several strategies to perform this optimization.

No.01CH37221)","","2001","6","","3461","3464 vol.6","Over the last 20-30 years, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) has become the algorithm of choice in numerous nonlinear estimation and machine learning applications. These include estimating the state of a nonlinear dynamic system as well estimating parameters for nonlinear system identification (eg, learning the weights of a neural network). The EKF applies the standard linear Kalman filter methodology to a linearization of the true nonlinear system. This approach is sub-optimal, and can easily lead to divergence. Julier et al. (1997), proposed the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) as a derivative-free alternative to the extended Kalman filter in the framework of state estimation. This was extended to parameter estimation by Wan and Van der Merwe et al., (2000). The UKF consistently outperforms the EKF in terms of prediction and estimation error, at an equal computational complexity of (OL/sup 3/)/sup l/ for general state-space problems. When the EKF is applied to parameter estimation, the special form of the state-space equations allows for an O(L/sup 2/) implementation. This paper introduces the square-root unscented Kalman filter (SR-UKF) which is also O(L/sup 3/) for general state estimation and O(L/sup 2/) for parameter estimation (note the original formulation of the UKF for parameter-estimation was O(L/sup 3/)).

These techniques were derived from microwave holography techniques that utilize phase and amplitude information recorded over a two-dimensional aperture to reconstruct a focused image of the target. Millimeter-wave imaging is well suited for the detection of concealed weapons or other contraband carried on personnel since millimeter-waves are nonionizing, readily penetrate common clothing material, and are reflected from the human body and any concealed items. In this paper, a wide-bandwidth three-dimensional holographic microwave imaging technique is described. Practical weapon detection systems for airport or other high-throughput applications require high-speed scanning on the order of 3 to 10 s. To achieve this goal, a prototype imaging system utilizing a 27-33 GHz linear sequentially switched array and a high-speed linear scanner has been developed and tested.

Transmitting at rates below this capacity, a randomly chosen element of the given ensemble will achieve an arbitrarily small target probability of error with a probability that approaches one exponentially fast in the length of the code. (By concatenating with an appropriate outer code one can achieve a probability of error that approaches zero exponentially fast in the length of the code with arbitrarily small loss in rate.) Conversely, transmitting at rates above this capacity the probability of error is bounded away from zero by a strictly positive constant which is independent of the length of the code and of the number of iterations performed. Our results are based on the observation that the concentration of the performance of the decoder around its average performance, as observed by Luby et al. in the case of a binary-symmetric channel and a binary message-passing algorithm, is a general phenomenon. For the particularly important case of belief-propagation decoders, we provide an effective algorithm to determine the corresponding capacity to any desired degree of accuracy. The ideas presented in this paper are broadly applicable and extensions of the general method to low-density parity-check codes over larger alphabets, turbo codes, and other concatenated coding schemes are outlined.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.910577","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910577","","Error detection coding","error detection codes;turbo codes;memoryless systems;telecommunication channels;error statistics;concatenated codes;iterative decoding","low-density parity-check codes;code capacity;message-passing decoding;binary-input memoryless channel;continuous output alphabet;discrete output alphabet;error probability;code length;outer code;code rate;decoder performance;binary-symmetric channel;binary message-passing algorithm;belief-propagation decoders;turbo codes;concatenated coding;iterative decoding","","1875","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes that machine intelligence needs to include emotional intelligence and demonstrates results toward this goal: developing a machine's ability to recognize the human affective state given four physiological signals. We describe difficult issues unique to obtaining reliable affective data and collect a large set of data from a subject trying to elicit and experience each of eight emotional states, daily, over multiple weeks. This paper presents and compares multiple algorithms for feature-based recognition of emotional state from this data. We analyze four physiological signals that exhibit problematic day-to-day variations: The features of different emotions on the same day tend to cluster more tightly than do the features of the same emotion on different days. To handle the daily variations, we propose new features and algorithms and compare their performance. We find that the technique of seeding a Fisher Projection with the results of sequential floating forward search improves the performance of the Fisher Projection and provides the highest recognition rates reported to date for classification of affect from physiology: 81 percent recognition accuracy on eight classes of emotion, including neutral.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.954607","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=954607","","Machine intelligence;Intelligent agent;Emotion recognition;Humans;Clustering algorithms;Pattern recognition;Neuroscience;Data analysis;Signal analysis;Physiology","artificial intelligence;psychology;pattern classification;feature extraction;man-machine systems","machine emotional intelligence;physiological patterns;feature selection;Fisher Projection;affective computing;forward search;pattern classification","","1090","","51","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method can be combined with any speech enhancement algorithm which requires a noise power spectral density estimate. In contrast to other methods, our approach does not use a voice activity detector. Instead it tracks spectral minima in each frequency band without any distinction between speech activity and speech pause. By minimizing a conditional mean square estimation error criterion in each time step we derive the optimal smoothing parameter for recursive smoothing of the power spectral density of the noisy speech signal. Based on the optimally smoothed power spectral density estimate and the analysis of the statistics of spectral minima an unbiased noise estimator is developed. The estimator is well suited for real time implementations. Furthermore, to improve the performance in nonstationary noise we introduce a method to speed up the tracking of the spectral minima.

Features such as, e.g., band power or adaptive autoregressive parameters are either extracted in bipolar EEG recordings overlaying sensorimotor areas or from an array of electrodes located over central and neighboring areas. For the classification of the features, linear discrimination analysis and neural networks are used. Characteristic for the Graz BCI is that a classifier is set up in a learning session and updated after one or more sessions with online feedback using the procedure of ""rapid prototyping."" As a result, a discrimination of two brain states (e.g., leftversus right-hand movement imagination) can be reached within only a few days of training.

The dependence of these leakages on MOSFET geometry and structure is discussed along with design criteria for minimizing short-channel effects and other issues related to scaling. Scaling limits due to these leakage currents arise from application constraints related to power consumption and circuit functionality. We describe how these constraints work out for some of the most important application classes: dynamic random access memory (DRAM), static random access memory (SRAM), low-power portable devices, and moderate and high-performance CMOS logic. As a summary, we provide a table of our estimates of the scaling limits for various applications and device types.

A design structure matrix (DSM) provides a simple, compact, and visual representation of a complex system that supports innovative solutions to decomposition and integration problems. The advantages of DSMs vis-a-vis alternative system representation and analysis techniques have led to their increasing use in a variety of contexts, including product development; project planning, project management, systems engineering, and organization design. This paper reviews two types of DSMs, static and time-based DSMs, and four DSM applications: (1) component-based or architecture DSM, useful for modeling system component relationships and facilitating appropriate architectural decomposition strategies; (2) team-based or organization DSM, beneficial for designing integrated organization structures that account for team interactions; (3) activity-based or schedule DSM, advantageous for modeling the information flow among process activities; and (4) parameter-based (or low-level schedule) DSM, effective for integrating low-level design processes based on physical design parameter relationships. A discussion of each application is accompanied by an industrial example. The review leads to conclusions regarding the benefits of DSMs in practice and barriers to their use. The paper also discusses research directions and new DSM applications, both of which may be approached with a perspective on the four types of DSMs and their relationships.","1558-0040","","10.1109/17.946528","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=946528","","Systems engineering","systems engineering;project management;product development","design structure matrix;system decomposition;systems engineering;products engineering;processes engineering;organizations;system integration;visual representation;complex system;analysis techniques;product development;project planning;project management;system component relationships modeling;integrated organization structures;team interactions;information flow;physical design parameter relationships;scheduling","","734","","122","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Each MARG sensor contains a three-axis magnetometer, a three-axis angular rate sensor, and a three-axis accelerometer. The filter represents rotations using quaternions rather than Euler angles, which eliminates the long-standing problem of singularities associated with attitude estimation. A process model for rigid body angular motions and angular rate measurements is defined. The process model converts angular rates into quaternion rates, which are integrated to obtain quaternions. The Gauss-Newton iteration algorithm is utilized to find the best quaternion that relates the measured accelerations and earth magnetic field in the body coordinate frame to calculated values in the earth coordinate frame. The best quaternion is used as part of the measurements for the Kalman filter. As a result of this approach, the measurement equations of the Kalman filter become linear, and the computational requirements are significantly reduced, making it possible to estimate orientation in real time. Extensive testing of the filter with synthetic data and actual sensor data proved it to be satisfactory. Test cases included the presence of large initial errors as well as high noise levels. In all cases the filter was able to converge and accurately track rotational motions.","","0-7803-6612-3","10.1109/IROS.2001.976367","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=976367","","Quaternions;Magnetic field measurement;Magnetic sensors;Filters;Magnetic separation;Earth;Testing;Gravity;Magnetometers;Accelerometers","Kalman filters;nonlinear filters;magnetic sensors;magnetometers;position measurement;angular measurement;state estimation;accelerometers;convergence;matrix algebra;Newton method","extended Kalman filter;quaternion-based orientation estimation;MARG sensors;real-time estimation;rigid body orientation;gravity sensors;three-axis accelerometer;singularities;attitude estimation;process model;rigid body angular motions;Gauss-Newton iteration algorithm;magnetic sensors;three-axis magnetometer;three-axis angular rate sensor","","204","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The basic idea is to first estimate local covariance coefficients from a low-resolution image and then use these covariance estimates to adapt the interpolation at a higher resolution based on the geometric duality between the low-resolution covariance and the high-resolution covariance. The edge-directed property of covariance-based adaptation attributes to its capability of tuning the interpolation coefficients to match an arbitrarily oriented step edge. A hybrid approach of switching between bilinear interpolation and covariance-based adaptive interpolation is proposed to reduce the overall computational complexity. Two important applications of the new interpolation algorithm are studied: resolution enhancement of grayscale images and reconstruction of color images from CCD samples.

For the (3,6)-regular LDPC code, for example, the complexity of encoding is essentially quadratic in the block length. However, we show that the associated coefficient can be made quite small, so that encoding codes even of length n/spl sime/100000 is still quite practical. More importantly, we show that ""optimized"" codes actually admit linear time encoding.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.910579","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910579","","Error detection coding","error detection codes;iterative decoding;random codes;computational complexity;sparse matrices;optimisation","efficient encoding;low-density parity-check codes;turbo codes;performance;complexity;constrained random code ensembles;iterative decoding algorithms;sparse parity-check matrices;regular LDPC code;block length;coefficient;code length;optimized codes;linear time encoding;binary erasure channel","","621","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Goal-oriented requirements engineering is concerned with the use of goals for eliciting, elaborating, structuring, specifying, analyzing, negotiating, documenting, and modifying requirements. This area has received increasing attention. The paper reviews various research efforts undertaken along this line of research. The arguments in favor of goal orientation are first briefly discussed. The paper then compares the main approaches to goal modeling, goal specification and goal-based reasoning in the many activities of the requirements engineering process.

This consists of four rehabilitation routines, each designed to exercise one specific parameter of hand movement: range, speed, fractionation or strength. The use of performance-based target levels is designed to increase patient motivation and individualize exercise difficulty to a patient's current state. Pilot clinical trials have been performed using the above system combined with noncomputer tasks, such as pegboard insertion or tracing of 2D patterns. Three chronic stroke patients used this rehabilitation protocol daily for two weeks.

This treatment shows the importance of inductance selection for oscillator noise optimization. A design strategy centered around an inductance selection scheme is executed using a practical graphical optimization method to optimize phase noise subject to design constraints such as power dissipation, tank amplitude, tuning range, startup condition, and diameters of spiral inductors. The optimization technique is demonstrated through a design example, leading to a 2.4-GHz fully integrated, LC voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) implemented using 0.35-/spl mu/m MOS transistors. The measured phase-noise values are -121, -117, and -115 dBc/Hz at 600-kHz offset from 1.91, 2.03, and 2.60-GHz carriers, respectively. The VCO dissipates 4 mA from a 2.5-V supply voltage.

In particular, we focus on two pilot-aided schemes: the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and the Bayesian minimum mean square error estimator (MMSEE). The advantage of the former is that it is simpler to implement as it needs no information on the channel statistics. On the other hand, the MMSEE is expected to have better performance as it exploits prior information about the channel. Theoretical analysis and computer simulations are used in the comparisons. At SNR values of practical interest, the two schemes are found to exhibit nearly equal performance, provided that the number of pilot tones is sufficiently greater than the CIRs length. Otherwise, the MMSEE is superior. In any case, the MMSEE is more complex to implement.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.969514","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=969514","","Channel estimation;OFDM;Maximum likelihood estimation;Statistics;Interpolation;Frequency division multiplexing;Maximum likelihood detection;Mean square error methods;Streaming media;Digital video broadcasting","OFDM modulation;transient response;least mean squares methods;maximum likelihood estimation;Bayes methods","pilot-aided channel estimation;OFDM systems;channel impulse response;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;pilot-aided schemes;maximum likelihood estimator;MLE;MMSEE;Bayesian minimum mean square error estimator;computer simulations;SNR;pilot tones;signal model","","578","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Can one recover, from knowledge of S alone, the precise collection of atoms going to make up S? Because every discrete-time signal can be represented as a superposition of spikes alone, or as a superposition of sinusoids alone, there is no unique way of writing S as a sum of spikes and sinusoids in general. We prove that if S is representable as a highly sparse superposition of atoms from this time-frequency dictionary, then there is only one such highly sparse representation of S, and it can be obtained by solving the convex optimization problem of minimizing the l/sup 1/ norm of the coefficients among all decompositions. Here ""highly sparse"" means that N/sub t/+N/sub w/</spl radic/N/2 where N/sub t/ is the number of time atoms, N/sub w/ is the number of frequency atoms, and N is the length of the discrete-time signal. Underlying this result is a general l/sup 1/ uncertainty principle which says that if two bases are mutually incoherent, no nonzero signal can have a sparse representation in both bases simultaneously. For the above setting, the bases are sinusoids and spikes, and mutual incoherence is measured in terms of the largest inner product between different basis elements. The uncertainty principle holds for a variety of interesting basis pairs, not just sinusoids and spikes. The results have idealized applications to band-limited approximation with gross errors, to error-correcting encryption, and to separation of uncoordinated sources. Related phenomena hold for functions of a real variable, with basis pairs such as sinusoids and wavelets, and for functions of two variables, with basis pairs such as wavelets and ridgelets. In these settings, if a function f is representable by a sufficiently sparse superposition of terms taken from both bases, then there is only one such sparse representation; it may be obtained by minimum l/sup 1/ norm atomic decomposition. The condition ""sufficiently sparse"" becomes a multiscale condition; for example, that the number of wavelets at level j plus the number of sinusoids in the jth dyadic frequency band are together less than a constant times 2/sup j/2/.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.959265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=959265","","Signal representations","indeterminancy;signal representation;wavelet transforms;time-frequency analysis","uncertainty principles;ideal atomic decomposition;discrete-time signal length;time-frequency dictionary;spike sequences;sinusoids;discrete-time signal representation;convex optimization problem;sparse representation;mutual incoherence;band-limited approximation;error-correcting encryption;uncoordinated source separation;wavelets;ridgelets;multiscale condition;dyadic frequency band","","1025","","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For memoryless binary-input continuous-output additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and sum-product decoders, we use a Gaussian approximation for message densities under density evolution to simplify the analysis of the decoding algorithm. We convert the infinite-dimensional problem of iteratively calculating message densities, which is needed to find the exact threshold, to a one-dimensional problem of updating the means of the Gaussian densities. This simplification not only allows us to calculate the threshold quickly and to understand the behavior of the decoder better, but also makes it easier to design good irregular LDPC codes for AWGN channels. For various regular LDPC codes we have examined, thresholds can be estimated within 0.1 dB of the exact value. For rates between 0.5 and 0.9, codes designed using the Gaussian approximation perform within 0.02 dB of the best performing codes found so far by using density evolution when the maximum variable degree is 10. We show that by using the Gaussian approximation, we can visualize the sum-product decoding algorithm. We also show that the optimization of degree distributions can be understood and done graphically using the visualization.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.910580","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910580","","Error detection coding","error detection codes;decoding;AWGN channels;approximation theory;optimisation;evolutionary computation;memoryless systems","low-density parity-check codes;Gaussian approximation;density evolution algorithm;message-passing decoding;memoryless binary-input continuous-output channels;additive white Gaussian noise channels;AWGN channels;sum-product decoders;infinite-dimensional problem;Gaussian densities;irregular LDPC codes;regular LDPC codes;thresholds;code rates;maximum variable degree;sum-product decoding algorithm;optimization;degree distributions;visualization","","712","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A simulator working in the Q-V realm was used for simplified circuit level simulation. In order to evaluate the power delivered by a charge pump, a resistive load is attached to the output of the charge pump and an equivalent capacitance is evaluated. A comparison of the voltage doubler circuits with Dickson charge pump and Makowski's voltage multiplier is presented in terms of the area requirements, the voltage gain, and the power level. This paper also identifies optimum loading conditions for different configurations of the charge pumps. Design guidelines for the desired voltage and power levels are discussed.

The three primary absorbers at these wavelengths, water and both oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, all have relatively weak absorption. This fortuitous fact provides a spectral window through which we can attempt to localize absorption (primarily by the two forms of hemoglobin) and scattering in the tissue. The most important current applications of DOT are detecting tumors in the breast and imaging the brain. We introduce the basic idea of DOT and review the history of optical methods in medicine as relevant to the development of DOT. We then detail the concept of DOT, including a review of the tissue's optical properties, modes of operation for DOT, and the challenges which the development of DOT must overcome. The basics of modelling the DOT forward problem and some critical issues among the numerous implementations that have been investigated for the DOT inverse problem, with an emphasis on signal processing.

Numerical analyses and experimental measurements confirm that the new models correctly predict the small-signal responses up to one third of the switching frequency and are more accurate than all previous models.

As privacy concerns continue to develop along with the digital communication domain, steganography will undoubtedly play a growing role in society. For this reason, it is important that we are aware of digital steganography technology and its implications. Equally important are the ethical concerns of using steganography and steganalysis.

The nonsinusoidal changes of flux originate from driving these devices by nonsinusoidal voltages and currents at different switching frequencies. A detailed examination of a dynamic hysteresis model shows that the physical origin of losses in magnetic material is the average rate of remagnetization rather than the remagnetization frequency. This principle leads to a modification of the most common calculation rule for magnetic core losses, i.e., to the ""modified Steinmetz equation"" (MSE). In the MSE, the remagnetization frequency is replaced by an equivalent frequency which is calculated from the average remagnetization rate. This approach allows, for the first time, the calculation of the losses in the time domain for arbitrary waveforms of flux while using the available set of parameters of the classical Steinmetz equation. DC premagnetization of the material, having a substantial influence on the losses, can also be included.

Using a small number of training images of each face taken with different lighting directions, the shape and albedo of the face can be reconstructed. In turn, this reconstruction serves as a generative model that can be used to render (or synthesize) images of the face under novel poses and illumination conditions. The pose space is then sampled and, for each pose, the corresponding illumination cone is approximated by a low-dimensional linear subspace whose basis vectors are estimated using the generative model. Our recognition algorithm assigns to a test image the identity of the closest approximated illumination cone.

A wide range of output power is controlled with only a narrow variation in operating frequency. In addition, zero-voltage switching can be achieved over the entire operating range.

A systematic procedure is given for designing a FP device, using two-dimensional (2-D) simulation, to obtain the maximum V/sub br/, with minimum degradation in on-resistance and frequency response. It is found that significantly higher V/sub br/ can be achieved by raising the dielectric constant (/spl epsi//sub i/) of the insulator beneath the FP. Simulation gave the following estimates.

The data used in the calculation was wind speed and irradiance of Login Airport Boston (LAB) obtained from the National Climate Center in North Carolina. The present performance study is based on two-year operation. (May 1996-Apr 1998) of the WPS. Unlike conventional generation, the wind and the sunrays are available at no cost and generate electricity pollution-free. Around noontime the WPS satisfies its load and provides additional energy to the storage or to the grid. On-site energy production is undoubtedly accompanied with minimization of environmental pollution, reduction of losses in power systems transmission and distribution equipment, and supports the utility in demand side management.

Eel generators make use of the regular trail of traveling vortices behind a bluff body to strain the piezoelectric elements; the resulting undulating motion resembles that of a natural eel swimming. Internal batteries are used to store the surplus energy generated by the Eel for later use by a small, unattended sensor or robot. Because of the properties of commercially available piezoelectric polymers, Eels will be relatively inexpensive and are easily scaleable in size and have the capacity to generate from milli-watts to many watts depending on system size and flow velocity of the local environment. A practical Eel structure has been developed that uses the commercially available piezoelectric polymer, PVDF. Future Eels may use more efficient electrostrictive polymer. Every aspect of the system from the interactions between the hydrodynamics of the water flow and structural elements of the Eel, through the mechanical energy input to the piezoelectric material, and finally the electric power output delivered through an optimized resonant circuit has been modeled and tested. The complete Eel system, complete with a generation and storage system, has been demonstrated in a wave tank. Future work on the Eel will focus on developing and then deploying a small, lightweight, one-watt power generation unit, initially in an estuary and then subsequently in the ocean. Such Eels will have the ability to recharge batteries or capacitors of a distributed robotic group, or remote sensor array, thus extending the mission life indefinitely in regions containing flowing water.","1558-1691","","10.1109/48.972090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=972090","","Oceans;Rivers;Polymers;Batteries;Robot sensing systems;Circuit testing;Sensor arrays;Capacitive sensors;Electrostriction;Hydrodynamics","electric power generation;direct energy conversion;piezoelectric actuators;piezoelectric thin films;intelligent actuators","Energy Harvesting Eel;piezoelectric polymers;mechanical flow energy conversion;Eel generators;traveling vortices;bluff body;undulating motion;natural eel swimming;PVDF;electrostrictive polymer;distributed robotic group;autonomous power systems;resonant electronics;vortex shedding;autonomous oceanographic sampling networks;small subsurface ocean/river power generator;bending moment;flexible polymer","","367","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This design pattern is partition-independent, because it is expressed in terms of an interactive application running in a single address space. Applying the Model/View/Controller design pattern to web-applications is therefore complicated by the fact that current technologies encourage developers to partition the application as early as in the design phase. Subsequent changes to that partitioning require considerable changes to the application's implementation-despite the fact that the application logic has not changed. This paper introduces the concept of Flexible Web-Application Partitioning, a programming model and implementation infrastructure, that allows developers to apply the Model/View/Controller design pattern in a partition-independent manner Applications are developed and tested in a single address-space; they can then be deployed to various client/server architectures without changing the application's source code.

To be able to walk stably in various environments, such as on rough terrain, up and down slopes, or in regions containing obstacles, it is necessary for the robot to adapt to the ground conditions with a foot motion, and maintain its stability with a torso motion. When the ground conditions and stability constraint are satisfied, it is desirable to select a walking pattern that requires small torque and velocity of the joint actuators. We first formulate the constraints of the foot motion parameters. By varying the values of the constraint parameters, we can produce different types of foot motion to adapt to ground conditions. We then propose a method for formulating the problem of the smooth hip motion with the largest stability margin using only two parameters, and derive the hip trajectory by iterative computation. Finally, the correlation between the actuator specifications and the walking patterns is described through simulation studies, and the effectiveness of the proposed methods is confirmed by simulation examples and experimental results.","2374-958X","","10.1109/70.938385","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=938385","","Legged locomotion;Mobile robots;Foot;Stability;Actuators;Hip;Computational modeling;Torso;Torque;Iterative methods","legged locomotion;path planning;iterative methods;splines (mathematics);robot dynamics","walking patterns;biped robot;mobility;rough terrain;slopes;ground conditions;foot motion;torso motion;stability constraint;smooth hip motion;largest stability margin;hip trajectory;actuator specifications","","580","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Lab., Tampere Univ. of Technol., Finland; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","","2001","49","10","2335","2344","I/Q signal processing is widely utilized in today's communication receivers. However, all I/Q processing receiver structures, such as the low-IF receiver, face a common problem of matching the amplitudes and phases of the I and Q branches. In practice, imbalances are unavoidable in the analog front-end, which results in finite and usually insufficient rejection of the image frequency band. This causes the image signal to appear as interference on top of the desired signal. We carry out general signal analysis of an imbalanced I/Q processing receiver and propose novel methods for I/Q imbalance compensation using baseband digital signal processing. A simple structure for compensation is derived, based on a traditional adaptive interference canceller. Improved image rejection can also be obtained by using more advanced blind source separation techniques. Theoretical analysis of the performance of the proposed imbalance compensation structures is presented. In addition, some simulation results are provided in order to further evaluate the performance of the proposed methods. The results indicate that the I/Q imbalance can be effectively compensated during the normal operation of the receiver even in the rapidly changing case, as long as a linear system model for the imbalance is valid.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.950789","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=950789","","Signal processing;Face;Frequency;Signal analysis;Baseband;Digital signal processing;Interference cancellation;Blind source separation;Performance analysis;Linear systems","radio receivers;compensation;radiofrequency interference;interference suppression;adaptive signal processing","I/Q imbalance compensation;communication receivers;I/Q signal processing;low-IF receiver;amplitudes;phases;analog front-end;interference;general signal analysis;baseband digital signal processing;adaptive interference canceller;image rejection;blind source separation;imbalance compensation structures;linear system","","308","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Fuzzy logic is employed only for the design; the resulting controller does not need to execute any fuzzy rule base, and is actually a conventional PID controller with analytical formulae. The main improvement is in endowing the classical controller with a certain adaptive control capability. The constant PID control gains are optimized by using the multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA), thereby yielding an optimal fuzzy PID controller.

In addition to the fuel cell stack itself, a fuel cell system includes a fuel processor and subsystems to manage air, water thermal energy, and power. The overall system is efficient at full and part-load, scaleable to a wide range of sizes, environmentally friendly, and potentially competitive with conventional technology in first cost. Promising applications for fuel cells include portable power, transportation, building cogeneration, and distributed power for utilities. For portable power a fuel cell coupled with a fuel container can offer a higher energy storage density and more convenience than conventional battery systems. In transportation applications, fuel cells offer higher efficiency and better part-load performance than conventional engines. In stationary power applications, low emissions permit fuel cells to be located in high power density areas where they can supplement the existing utility grid.

A buck-boost converter with two independently controlled switches can work as a boost or as a buck converter depending on input-output conditions, and thus achieves lower stresses on components. Using the converter synthesis method from D. Zhou (1995), families of two-switch buck-boost converters are generated, including several new converter topologies. The two-switch buck-boost converters are evaluated and compared in terms of component stresses in universal-input power-factor-corrector applications. Among them, one new two-switch converter is identified that has low inductor conduction losses (50% of the boost converter), low inductor volt-seconds (72% of the boost converter), and about the same switch conduction losses and voltage stresses as the boost converter.","0275-9306","0-7803-7067-8","10.1109/PESC.2001.954206","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=954206","","Pulse width modulation converters;Switching converters;Stress;Switches;Energy storage;Voltage;Buck converters;Topology;Inductors;Power electronics","DC-DC power convertors;PWM power convertors;switching circuits;power factor correction;equivalent circuits","single-switch step-up/step-down converters;component voltage stresses;component current stresses;buck-boost convertors;SEPIC convertors;Cuk convertors;buck converter;input-output conditions;universal-input power-factor-corrector applications;inductor conduction losses;switch conduction losses","","59","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Powerful automotive radar systems are currently under development for various applications. Radar sensor based comfort systems like Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) are already available on the market. The main objective from a radar sensor point of view is to detect all targets inside the observation area and estimate target range and relative velocity simultaneously with a high update rate. FMCW radar sensors have the advantages of very high range resolution but a serious task occurs in multiple target situations to suppress so-called ghost targets. In classical FMCW waveforms this has been solved in using multiple chirp signals with different slope. But in this case a long measurement time (approximately 50 ms) is needed which is a contradiction to a high update rate. Therefore, in this paper a new waveform design is presented which has all advantages of FMCW radars but needs an extremely low measurement time (10 ms) in a radar sensor with 3 different antenna beams.","","0-7803-7000-7","10.1109/ICR.2001.984612","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=984612","","Automotive engineering;Radar antennas;Radar applications;Antenna measurements;Time measurement;Radar measurements;Automotive applications;Sensor systems;Adaptive systems;Programmable control","road vehicle radar;CW radar;FM radar;radar detection;radar resolution;target tracking;radar tracking;radar antennas","FMCW radar sensor;automotive radar;comfort systems;adaptive cruise control;radar detection;target range estimation;relative velocity;update rate;radar resolution;multiple target;ghost target suppression;waveform design;measurement time;antenna beams","","78","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The technique is generally applicable to classes E, C, and F as well as PAs with harmonic reactances not corresponding to those of established classes. The analysis shows that the maximum achievable efficiency depends not upon the class of operation, but upon the number of harmonics employed. For any set of harmonic reactances, the same maximum efficiency can be achieved by proper adjustment of the waveforms and the fundamental-frequency load reactance.

Various goals are possible; one involves rate of fault detection, a measure of how quickly faults are detected within the testing process. An improved rate of fault detection during testing can provide faster feedback on the system under test and let software engineers begin correcting faults earlier than might otherwise be possible. One application of prioritization techniques involves regression testing, the retesting of software following modifications; in this context, prioritization techniques can take advantage of information gathered about the previous execution of test cases to obtain test case orderings. We describe several techniques for using test execution information to prioritize test cases for regression testing, including: 1) techniques that order test cases based on their total coverage of code components; 2) techniques that order test cases based on their coverage of code components not previously covered; and 3) techniques that order test cases based on their estimated ability to reveal faults in the code components that they cover. We report the results of several experiments in which we applied these techniques to various test suites for various programs and measured the rates of fault detection achieved by the prioritized test suites, comparing those rates to the rates achieved by untreated, randomly ordered, and optimally ordered suites.","1939-3520","","10.1109/32.962562","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=962562","","Computer aided software engineering;Software testing;Fault detection;Costs;Computer Society;System testing;Software maintenance;Processor scheduling;Feedback;Application software","program testing;program debugging","test case prioritization;regression testing;software testing;test case scheduling;software fault detection rate;software fault correction;code component coverage;experiments;cost-benefit analysis","","626","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Batteries used in PV applications have different performance characteristics compared with batteries used in more traditional applications. In PV applications, lead acid batteries do not reach the cycle of lead acid batteries used in other applications such as uninterruptible power supplies or electric vehicles. The shortened battery life contributes significantly to the costs of a PV system. In some PV systems the battery accounts for more than 40% of the life cycle costs.

Finite-geometry LDPC codes can be decoded in various ways, ranging from low to high decoding complexity and from reasonably good to very good performance. They perform very well with iterative decoding. Furthermore, they can be put in either cyclic or quasi-cyclic form. Consequently, their encoding can be achieved in linear time and implemented with simple feedback shift registers. This advantage is not shared by other LDPC codes in general and is important in practice. Finite-geometry LDPC codes can be extended and shortened in various ways to obtain other good LDPC codes. Several techniques of extension and shortening are presented.

Manjunath","Hewlett-Packard Co., Palo Alto, CA, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","","2001","23","8","800","810","A method for unsupervised segmentation of color-texture regions in images and video is presented. This method, which we refer to as JSEG, consists of two independent steps: color quantization and spatial segmentation. In the first step, colors in the image are quantized to several representative classes that can be used to differentiate regions in the image. The image pixels are then replaced by their corresponding color class labels, thus forming a class-map of the image. The focus of this work is on spatial segmentation, where a criterion for ""good"" segmentation using the class-map is proposed. Applying the criterion to local windows in the class-map results in the ""J-image,"" in which high and low values correspond to possible boundaries and interiors of color-texture regions. A region growing method is then used to segment the image based on the multiscale J-images. A similar approach is applied to video sequences. An additional region tracking scheme is embedded into the region growing process to achieve consistent segmentation and tracking results, even for scenes with nonrigid object motion. Experiments show the robustness of the JSEG algorithm on real images and video.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.946985","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=946985","","Image segmentation;Quantization;Tracking;Layout;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Color;Pixel;Focusing;Robustness;Parameter estimation","image segmentation;image sequences;image texture;video signal processing;data compression;image coding;image colour analysis","unsupervised segmentation;color-texture regions;JSEG method;color quantization;spatial segmentation;color class labels;class-map;local windows;J-image;region growing method;multiscale images;video sequences;region tracking;nonrigid object motion;image segmentation","","936","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Learn++ utilizes ensemble of classifiers by generating multiple hypotheses using training data sampled according to carefully tailored distributions. The outputs of the resulting classifiers are combined using a weighted majority voting procedure.

Furthermore, for video multicast, it is difficult to achieve both efficiency and flexibility. Thus, Internet streaming video poses many challenges. In this article we cover six key areas of streaming video. Specifically, we cover video compression, application-layer QoS control, continuous media distribution services, streaming servers, media synchronization mechanisms, and protocols for streaming media.

Other than the destination's position, each node need know only its own position and the position of its one-hop neighbors in order to forward packets. Since it is not necessary to maintain explicit routes, position-based routing does scale well even if the network is highly dynamic. This is a major advantage in a mobile ad hoc network where the topology may change frequently. The main prerequisite for position-based routing is that a sender can obtain the current position of the destination. Therefore, previously proposed location services are discussed in addition to position-based packet forwarding strategies. We provide a qualitative comparison of the approaches in both areas and investigate opportunities for future research.","1558-156X","","10.1109/65.967595","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=967595","","Intelligent networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Floods;National electric code;Europe;Network topology;Taxonomy;Proposals;Network servers","land mobile radio;network topology;packet radio networks;protocols;telecommunication network routing","distance routing effect algorithm;position-based packet forwarding;location services;network node;packet destination geographical location;ad hoc routing protocols;network topology;mobile ad hoc networks;position-based routing","","912","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Cohn","Robotics Inst., Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA, USA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","","2001","23","2","97","115","Most automatic expression analysis systems attempt to recognize a small set of prototypic expressions, such as happiness, anger, surprise, and fear. Such prototypic expressions, however, occur rather infrequently. Human emotions and intentions are more often communicated by changes in one or a few discrete facial features. In this paper, we develop an automatic face analysis (AFA) system to analyze facial expressions based on both permanent facial features (brows, eyes, mouth) and transient facial features (deepening of facial furrows) in a nearly frontal-view face image sequence. The AFA system recognizes fine-grained changes in facial expression into action units (AU) of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), instead of a few prototypic expressions. Multistate face and facial component models are proposed for tracking and modeling the various facial features, including lips, eyes, brows, cheeks, and furrows. During tracking, detailed parametric descriptions of the facial features are extracted. With these parameters as the inputs, a group of action units (neutral expression, six upper face AU and 10 lower face AU) are recognized whether they occur alone or in combinations. The system has achieved average recognition rates of 96.4 percent (95.4 percent if neutral expressions are excluded) for upper face AU and 96.7 percent (95.6 percent with neutral expressions excluded) for lower face AU. The generalizability of the system has been tested by using independent image databases collected and FACS-coded for ground-truth by different research teams.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.908962","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=908962","","Face recognition;Facial features;Gold;Prototypes;Image analysis;Image sequence analysis;Eyes;Humans;Mouth;Transient analysis","face recognition;image sequences;tracking;feature extraction","action unit recognition;automatic facial expression analysis;happiness;anger;surprise;fear;discrete facial features;eyes;eyebrows;mouth;facial furrows;frontal-view face image sequence;AU;Facial Action Coding System;FACS;multistate face models;tracking;lips;cheeks;parametric descriptions;neutral expression;image databases","","834","","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for graph partitioning with an objective function that follows the min-max clustering principle. The relaxed version of the optimization of the min-max cut objective function leads to the Fiedler vector in spectral graph partitioning. Theoretical analyses of min-max cut indicate that it leads to balanced partitions, and lower bounds are derived. The min-max cut algorithm is tested on newsgroup data sets and is found to out-perform other current popular partitioning/clustering methods. The linkage-based refinements to the algorithm further improve the quality of clustering substantially. We also demonstrate that a linearized search order based on linkage differential is better than that based on the Fiedler vector, providing another effective partitioning method.","","0-7695-1119-8","10.1109/ICDM.2001.989507","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=989507","","Clustering algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Helium;Laboratories;Computer science;Mathematics;Application software;Mathematical model;Testing;Clustering methods","minimax techniques;graph theory;pattern clustering;data mining;vectors","min-max cut algorithm;graph partitioning;data clustering;graph model;data object pairwise similarities;weighted graph adjacency matrix;objective function;relaxed optimization;Fiedler vector;spectral graph partition;balanced partitions;lower bounds;newsgroup data sets;algorithm performance;linkage-based refinements;clustering quality;linearized search order;linkage differential","","305","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In general, it is now accepted that natural or asymmetrical regular sampled PWM with a third harmonic injected or a space-vector centered reference waveform gives the best harmonic performance, with discontinuous modulation having some advantages for higher modulation ratios. This paper uses a general analytical solution for carrier-based PWM to mathematically identify the harmonic cancellation that occurs in various PWM implementations and converter topologies. This solution provides a formal justification for the superiority of natural and asymmetrical regular sampling techniques in eliminating half of their sideband harmonics simply by virtue of their phase leg switching. Then, the use of fundamental reference phase shifting between phase legs to create single- and three-phase 1-1 output voltages is reviewed, and the harmonic cancellation that occurs is identified. One significant result from this analysis is the realization that an odd/triplen carrier/fundamental ratio has no intrinsic harmonic benefit, contrary to the generally accepted wisdom. Finally, opportunities for harmonic elimination in multilevel cascaded inverter systems by carrier phase shifting are investigated, and the optimum phase shift is identified.","1939-9367","","10.1109/28.913724","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=913724","","Pulse width modulation;Pulse width modulation inverters;Pulse width modulation converters;Leg;Topology;Voltage;Switches;Space vector pulse width modulation;Harmonic analysis;Industry Applications Society","PWM invertors;power conversion harmonics;harmonics suppression","harmonic cancellation;carrier-based PWM;multilevel cascaded inverters;two-level cascaded inverters;asymmetrical regular sampled PWM;third harmonic injection;space-vector centered reference waveform;harmonic performance;discontinuous modulation;higher modulation ratios;formal justification;asymmetrical regular sampling techniques;sideband harmonics elimination;phase leg switching;three-phase 1-1 output voltages;single-phase 1-1 output voltages;odd/triplen carrier/fundamental ratio;harmonic elimination;carrier phase shifting;optimum phase shift","","221","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An emerging analysis technique is the Poincare plot, which takes a sequence of intervals and plots each interval against the following interval. The geometry of this plot has been shown to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy subjects in clinical settings. The Poincare plot is a valuable HRV analysis technique due to its ability to display nonlinear aspects of the interval sequence. The problem is, how does one quantitatively characterize the plot to capture useful summary descriptors that are independent of existing HRV measures? Researchers have investigated a number of techniques: converting the two-dimensional plot into various one-dimensional views; the fitting of an ellipse to the plot shape; and measuring the correlation coefficient of the plot. The authors investigate each of these methods in detail and show that they are all measuring linear aspects of the intervals which existing HRV indexes already specify. The fact that these methods appear insensitive to the nonlinear characteristics of the intervals is an important finding because the Poincare plot is primarily a nonlinear technique. Therefore, further work is needed to determine if better methods of characterizing Poincare plot geometry can be found.","1558-2531","","10.1109/10.959330","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=959330","","Geometry;Heart rate variability;Biomedical measurements;Shape measurement;Fluctuations;Statistics;Displays;Failure analysis;Cardiac disease;Cardiovascular diseases","electrocardiography;medical signal processing","Poincare plot geometry;nonlinear features;heart rate variability;two-dimensional plot;unhealthy subjects;healthy subjects;clinical settings;interval sequence;useful summary descriptors;one-dimensional views","Analysis of Variance;Biomedical Engineering;Heart Rate;Humans;Models, Cardiovascular;Models, Statistical;Nonlinear Dynamics","480","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Sci., Stanford Univ., CA, USA; NA; NA","Proceedings of the IEEE","","2001","89","4","490","504","Concern about the performance of wires wires in scaled technologies has led to research exploring other communication methods. This paper examines wire and gate delays as technologies migrate from 0.18-/spl mu/m to 0.035-/spl mu/m feature sizes to better understand the magnitude of the the wiring problem. Wires that shorten in length as technologies scale have delays that either track gate delays or grow slowly relative to gate delays. This result is good news since these ""local"" wires dominate chip wiring. Despite this scaling of local wire performance, computer-aided design (CAD) tools must still become move sophisticated in dealing with these wires. Under scaling, the total number of wires grows exponentially, so CAD tools will need to handle an ever-growing percentage of all the wires in order to keep designer workloads constant. Global wires present a more serious problem to designers. These are wires that do not scale in length since they communicate signals across the chip. The delay of these wives will remain constant if repeaters are used meaning that relative to gate delays, their delays scale upwards. These increased delays for global communication will drive architectures toward modular designs with explicit global latency mechanisms.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.920580","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=920580","","Delay;Wires;Wiring;Design automation;Integrated circuit interconnections;Integrated circuit technology;Paper technology;Hip;Global communication;Repeaters","technological forecasting;integrated circuit interconnections;delays;wires (electric)","wire technology;wire delay;gate delay;computer-aided design;integrated circuit interconnection;0.035 to 0.18 micron","","877","","56","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

No.01CH37263)","","2001","1","","813","821 vol.1","For some time, FBAR technology has lagged behind ceramic technology and surface acoustic wave resonator (SAW) technology for commercial applications. There were several technologies that had to be developed before FBAR technology became viable for rf filters. First, a process is needed that can make the resonators manufacturable, robust and repeatable. Second, maximizing the coupling coefficient, k/sub t//sup 2/ and the Q of the resonator (k/sub t//sup 2/ Q product) is necessary. Another technology needed is a method to eliminate ripple (or ""suck out"") associated with lateral mode excitation. Lastly, a method is needed for maintaining a uniform thickness (for frequency control and a means to target frequency to within +-0.03%). If one overcomes these sets of hurdles, the rewards are high. The Quality factor, Q, inherent in these structures is impressive (over 2500) and the intrinsic k/sub t//sup 2/ has been inferred to be close to the theoretical maximum of 6.5%. The k/sub t//sup 2/ Q product (Figure of Merit for FBAR filters) have been as high as 100 for our devices. These two properties can be combined in a filter to achieve low pass band insertion loss and extremely sharp skirts. One intrinsic advantage of FBAR over SAW technology is the ability to handle input power in excess of 4 Watts. Resistance to Electrical Static Discharge (ESD) is another desirable property of FBAR devices. Finally, FBAR technology is intrinsically a ""low temperature"" process technology-compatible with semiconductor technology. This implies future integration of FBARs with semiconductor circuits.","","0-7803-7177-1","10.1109/ULTSYM.2001.991846","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=991846","","Transistors;Acoustic waves;Film bulk acoustic resonators;Surface acoustic waves;Band pass filters;Ceramics;Resonator filters;Manufacturing processes;Robustness;Frequency control","bulk acoustic wave devices;thin film devices;Q-factor;acoustic resonator filters;electrostatic discharge","thin film bulk wave acoustic resonators;ceramic technology;rf filters;coupling coefficient;lateral mode excitation;uniform thickness;quality factor;low pass band insertion loss;sharp skirts;input power;electrostatic discharge;ESD;FBAR devices;integration;semiconductor circuits;wireless applications;FBAR technology;4 W","","129","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a fully automatic method for identifying the lungs in three-dimensional (3-D) pulmonary X-ray CT images. The method has three main steps. First, the lung region is extracted from the CT images by gray-level thresholding. Then, the left and right lungs are separated by identifying the anterior and posterior junctions by dynamic programming. Finally, a sequence of morphological operations is used to smooth the irregular boundary along the mediastinum in order to obtain results consistent with these obtained by manual analysis, in which only the most central pulmonary arteries are excluded from the lung region. The method has been tested by processing 3-D CT data sets from eight normal subjects, each imaged three times at biweekly intervals with lungs at 90% vital capacity. The authors present results by comparing their automatic method to manually traced borders from two image analysts. Averaged over all volumes, the root mean square difference between the computer and human analysis is 0.8 pixels (0.54 mm).

It is demonstrated that, while different cooling options can be tailored to the specific needs of individual applications, system considerations always play a paramount role in determining the most suitable cooling scheme. It is also shown that extensive fundamental electronic cooling knowledge has been amassed over the past two decades. Yet there is now a growing need for hardware innovations rather than perturbations to those fundamental studies.

This paper concentrates on the protection of a distribution system in the light of developments in distributed generation (DG). The conventional distribution system is radial in nature, characterized by a single source feeding a network of down-stream feeders. The protection system has traditionally been designed assuming the system to be radial. After connecting DG, part of the system may no longer be radial, which means the coordination might not hold. The effect of DG on coordination will depend on size, type and placement of DG. This paper explores the effect of DG on protective device coordination such as fuse-fuse, fuse-recloser and relay-relay. In each case, depending on size and placement of DG, there are some margins in which the coordination may hold and certain cases, where no margin is available. These conditions are identified for each case through coordination graphs.","","0-7803-7107-0","10.1109/LESCPE.2001.941636","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=941636","","Distributed control;Fault currents;Fuses;Power system protection;Power system stability;Power system reliability;Controllability;Joining processes;Protective relaying;Relays","power distribution protection;electric power generation;relay protection;power distribution reliability;electric fuses","distributed generation effect;protective device coordination;distribution system;system reliability;system controllability;system stability;fuse-fuse coordination;fuse-recloser coordination;relay-relay coordination","","189","","2","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Irrespective of the converter type, the controller is supposed to fulfill two objectives: (1) real power flow control which leads to the regulation of the DC quantity (DC voltage in VSC and DC current in CSC), and (2) reactive power flow control on the AC-side. The major difficulty in control is caused by the nonlinearities in the converter model. The existing control techniques are based on the design of the PI-controllers without the knowledge of the converter model, linearizing the nonlinear model, or splitting the original system into linear and nonlinear parts and dealing with them separately. In this paper, a power balance equation and nonlinear input transformation are used to derive a linear model from the original nonlinear model. Then, a decoupled state-feedback control method is applied to the new model. The accuracy of the new model and the performance of the applied control method are evaluated using the simulation results obtained from the PSCAD/EMTDC simulation package. It is shown that as a result of using the new model and applying the state-feedback control technique, the dynamics of the system are considerably improved resulting in short response times.

The switch constant overdrive also enhances considerably circuit linearity. Modulator coefficients of a single-loop third-order topology have been optimized for low power. Further reduction in the power consumption is obtained through a modified two-stage opamp.

The system was designed to detect in real-time the following gait phases: stance, heel-off, swing, and heel-strike. The gait phase detection system employed a gyroscope to measure the angular velocity of the foot and three force sensitive resistors to assess the forces exerted by the foot on the shoe sole during walking. A rule-based detection algorithm, which was running on a portable microprocessor board, processed the sensor signals. In the presented experimental study ten able bodied subjects and six subjects with impaired gait tested the device in both indoor and outdoor environments (0-25/spl deg/C). The subjects were asked to walk on flat and irregular surfaces, to step over small obstacles, to walk on inclined surfaces, and to ascend and descend stairs. Despite the significant variation in the individual walking styles the system achieved an overall detection reliability above 99% for both subject groups for the tasks involving walking on flat, irregular, and inclined surfaces. In the case of stair climbing and descending tasks the success rate of the system was above 99% for the able body subjects and above 96% for the subjects with impaired gait. The experiments also showed that the gait phase detection system, unlike other similar devices, was insensitive to perturbations caused by nonwalking activities such as weight shifting between legs during standing, feet sliding, sitting down, and standing up.","1558-0210","","10.1109/7333.928571","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=928571","","Phase detection;Legged locomotion;Force measurement;Foot;Control systems;Real time systems;Gyroscopes;Velocity measurement;Phase measurement;Angular velocity","gait analysis;prosthetics;neurophysiology;biomedical equipment;angular velocity measurement","reliable gait phase detection system;neuroprosthesis;walking;stance;heel-off;swing;heel-strike;gyroscope;rule-based detection algorithm;able bodied subjects;impaired gait;flat surfaces;irregular surfaces;stepping over small obstacles;walking on inclined surfaces;descending stairs;ascending stairs;individual walking styles;weight shifting between legs;feet sliding;sitting down;standing up;0 to 25 C","Adult;Algorithms;Automation;Biomechanics;Electromyography;Female;Gait;Humans;Male;Microcomputers;Middle Aged;Muscle, Skeletal","277","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In these measurements, as opposed to total gate capacitance, gate-drain and gate source capacitance are given and, thus, the electron and hole contributions of particular interface areas are separated. This paper shows split C-V measurement results of MOS transistors made in different technologies. The idea was to show that this method is widely applicable. Interpretation of experimental results is confirmed by numerical 2D calculations of the split C-V characteristics in device simulator MINIMOS6 by means of small signal ac analysis and by numerical quasi-static analysis. The influence of irradiation on split C-V characteristics and annealing process after radiation is also shown.

This paper studies an efficient ICI cancellation method termed ICI self-cancellation scheme. The scheme works in two very simple steps. At the transmitter side, one data symbol is modulated onto a group of adjacent subcarriers with a group of weighting coefficients. The weighting coefficients are designed so that the ICI caused by the channel frequency errors can be minimized. At the receiver side, by linearly combining the received signals on these subcarriers with proposed coefficients, the residual ICI contained in the received signals can then be further reduced. The carrier-to-interference power ratio (CIR) can be increased by 15 and 30 dB when the group size is two or three, respectively, for a channel with a constant frequency offset. Although the redundant modulation causes a reduction in bandwidth efficiency, it can be compensated, for example, by using larger signal alphabet sizes. Simulations show that OFDM systems using the proposed ICI self-cancellation scheme perform much better than standard systems while having the same bandwidth efficiency in multipath mobile radio channels with large Doppler frequencies.","1558-0857","","10.1109/26.935159","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=935159","","Mobile communication;OFDM modulation;Laboratories;Radiofrequency interference;Frequency division multiplexing;Land mobile radio;Bandwidth;Communication systems;Phase shift keying;Radio transmitters","OFDM modulation;land mobile radio;radiofrequency interference;interference suppression;multipath channels;Doppler effect","intercarrier interference self-cancellation;OFDM mobile communication systems;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;frequency offsets;mobile radio channels;subcarriers;intercarrier interference;ICI self-cancellation;transmitter;weighting coefficients;channel frequency errors;receiver;coefficients;carrier-to-interference power ratio;group size;redundant modulation;bandwidth efficiency;signal alphabet size;simulations;multipath mobile radio channels;Doppler frequencies","","512","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

NCS design objectives revolve around the performance and stability of a target physical device rather than of the network. The problem of stabilizing queue lengths, for example, is of secondary importance. Integrating computer networks into control systems to replace the traditional point-to-point wiring has enormous advantages, including lower cost, reduced weight and power, simpler installation and maintenance, and higher reliability.

Inst. of Sci. & Technol., Seoul, South Korea; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","","2001","11","4","475","484","An advanced histogram-equalization algorithm for contrast enhancement is presented. Histogram equalization is the most popular algorithm for contrast enhancement due to its effectiveness and simplicity. It can be classified into two branches according to the transformation function used: global or local. Global histogram equalization is simple and fast, but its contrast-enhancement power is relatively low. Local histogram equalization, on the other hand, can enhance overall contrast more effectively, but the complexity of computation required is very high due to its fully overlapped sub-blocks. In this paper, a low-pass filter-type mask is used to get a nonoverlapped sub-block histogram-equalization function to produce the high contrast associated with local histogram equalization but with the simplicity of global histogram equalization. This mask also eliminates the blocking effect of nonoverlapped sub-block histogram-equalization. The low-pass filter-type mask is realized by partially overlapped sub-block histogram-equalization (POSHE). With the proposed method, since the sub-blocks are much less overlapped, the computation overhead is reduced by a factor of about 100 compared to that of local histogram equalization while still achieving high contrast. The proposed algorithm can be used for commercial purposes where high efficiency is required, such as camcorders, closed-circuit cameras, etc.","1558-2205","","10.1109/76.915354","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=915354","","Histograms;Pixel;Low pass filters;Video equipment;Cameras;Image processing;Dynamic range;Image edge detection;Hardware;Image coding","image enhancement;equalisers;low-pass filters;filtering theory","advanced contrast enhancement;partially overlapped sub-block histogram equalization;histogram-equalization algorithm;transformation function;global histogram equalization;local histogram equalization;computational complexity;blocking effect elimination;low-pass filter-type mask;nonoverlapped sub-block histogram-equalization;computation overhead;high efficiency;camcorders;closed-circuit cameras","","320","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The channel capacity of the MIMO architecture in independent Rayleigh channels scales linearly as the number of antennas. However, the correlation of a real-world wireless channel may result in a substantial degradation of the MIMO architecture performance. In this letter, we investigate the MIMO channel capacity in correlated channels using the exponential correlation matrix model. We prove that, for this model, an increase in correlation is equivalent to a decrease in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For example, r=0.7 is the same as 3-dB decrease in SNR.","1558-2558","","10.1109/4234.951380","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=951380","","Channel capacity;MIMO;Signal to noise ratio;Receiving antennas;Predictive models;Wireless communication;Rayleigh channels;Degradation;Frequency;Rayleigh scattering","MIMO systems;channel capacity;correlation methods;multipath channels;Rayleigh channels;matrix algebra","MIMO architecture;channel capacity;exponential correlation matrix;multiple-input multiple output channel;wireless communications;rich multipath environment;Rayleigh channels;correlated channels;signal-to-noise ratio;SNR","","486","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Quantization index modulation: a class of provably good methods for digital watermarking and information embedding","B. Chen; G. W. Wornell","Dept. of Electr. Eng. & Comput.

The embedding is designed to achieve efficient tradeoffs among the three conflicting goals of maximizing the information-embedding rate, minimizing the distortion between the host signal and composite signal, and maximizing the robustness of the embedding. We introduce new classes of embedding methods, termed quantization index modulation (QIM) and distortion-compensated QIM (DC-QIM), and develop convenient realizations in the form of what we refer to as dither modulation. Using deterministic models to evaluate digital watermarking methods, we show that QIM is ""provably good"" against arbitrary bounded and fully informed attacks, which arise in several copyright applications, and in particular it achieves provably better rate distortion-robustness tradeoffs than currently popular spread-spectrum and low-bit(s) modulation methods. Furthermore, we show that for some important classes of probabilistic models, DC-QIM is optimal (capacity-achieving) and regular QIM is near-optimal. These include both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, which may be good models for hybrid transmission applications such as digital audio broadcasting, and mean-square-error-constrained attack channels that model private-key watermarking applications.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.923725","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=923725","","Digital audio broadcasting","copy protection;AWGN channels;digital audio broadcasting;modulation;data encapsulation;security of data;quantisation (signal);mean square error methods;rate distortion theory","quantization index modulation;digital watermarking;information embedding;composite signal;distortion;host signal;embedding methods;QIM;distortion-compensated QIM;DC-QIM;dither modulation;fully informed attacks;copyright applications;rate distortion-robustness;probabilistic models;additive white Gaussian noise channels;AWGN channels;hybrid transmission application;digital audio broadcasting;mean-square-error-constrained attack channel;private-key watermarking applications","","1267","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Roadmaps are employed as decision aids to improve coordination of activities and resources in increasingly complex and uncertain environments. Specific uses of roadmaps include: S&T management including strategy, planning, executing, reviewing, and transitioning; S&T marketing; enhancing communications among researchers, technologists, product managers, suppliers, users, and other stakeholders; identifying gaps and opportunities in S&T programs; and identifying obstacles to rapid and low-cost product development. S&T managers also use roadmaps to help identify those S&T areas that have high potential promise, and to accelerate the transfer of the S&T to eventual products. However, there has been little attention paid to the practice of roadmapping in the published literature. This paper is a first attempt to bring some common definition to roadmapping practices and display the underlying unity of seemingly fragmented roadmap approaches. The paper begins with generic roadmap definitions, including a taxonomy of roadmaps that attempts to better classify and unify the broad spectrum of roadmap objectives and uses. Characteristics of retrospective and prospective roadmaps are then identified and analyzed, as well as summary characteristics of bibliometric-based S&T mapping techniques.

Eng., California Univ., Berkeley, CA, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","","2001","14","2","112","133","The abrasion mechanism in solid-solid contact mode of the chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process is investigated in detail. Based on assumptions of plastic contact over wafer-abrasive and pad-abrasive interfaces, the normal distribution of abrasive size and an assumed periodic roughness of pad surface, a novel model is developed for material removal in CMP. The basic model is MRR=/spl rho//sub w/NVol/sub removed/, where /spl rho//sub w/ is the density of wafer N the number of active abrasives, and Vol/sub removed/ the volume of material removed by a single abrasive. The model proposed integrates process parameters including pressure and velocity and other important input parameters including the wafer hardness, pad hardness, pad roughness, abrasive size, and abrasive geometry into the same formulation to predict the material removal rate (MRR). An interface between the chemical effect and mechanical effect has been constructed through a fitting parameter H/sub w/ a ""dynamical"" hardness value of the wafer surface, in the model. It reflects the influences of chemicals on the mechanical material removal. The fluid effect in the current model is attributed to the number of active abrasives. It is found that the nonlinear down pressure dependence of material removal rate is related to a probability density function of the abrasive size and the elastic deformation of the pad. Compared with experimental results, the model accurately predicts MRR. With further verification of the model, a better understanding of the fundamental mechanism involved in material removal in the CMP process, particularly different roles played by the consumables and their interactions, can be obtained.","1558-2345","","10.1109/66.920723","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=920723","","Abrasives;Semiconductor device modeling;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Predictive models;Surface fitting;Chemical processes;Plastics;Gaussian distribution;Solid modeling","chemical mechanical polishing;abrasion;hardness;surface topography;semiconductor process modelling","chemical mechanical polishing;material removal mechanism;abrasion mechanism;solid-solid contact mode;plastic contact;pad-abrasive interfaces;wafer-abrasive interfaces;abrasive size;periodic roughness;wafer hardness;pad hardness;pad roughness;abrasive geometry;material removal rate;fitting parameter;fluid effect;nonlinear down pressure dependence;probability density function;elastic deformation","","358","","42","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the system, several channel ADCs operate at interleaved sampling times as if they were effectively a single ADC operating at a much higher sampling rate. However, mismatches such as offset, gain mismatches among channel ADCs as well as timing skew of the clocks distributed to them degrade S/N of the ADC system as a whole. This paper analyzes the channel mismatch effects in the time-interleaved ADC system. Previous analysis showed the effect for each mismatch individually, however in this paper we derive explicit formulas for the mismatch effects when all of offset, gain and timing mismatches exist together. We have clarified that the gain and timing mismatch effects interact with each other but the offset mismatch effect is independent from them, and this can be seen clearly in frequency domain. We also discuss the bandwidth mismatch effect. The derived formulas can be used for calibration algorithms to compensate for the channel mismatch effects.","1558-1268","","10.1109/81.915383","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=915383","","Sampling methods;Timing;Clocks;Calibration;Degradation;Bandwidth;Instruments;Large scale integration;Circuit testing;Circuit noise","analogue-digital conversion","channel mismatch;time-interleaved analog-digital converter;sampling rate;offset mismatch;gain mismatch;clock skew;timing mismatch;bandwidth mismatch;calibration algorithm","","315","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

From these observations, reference models comprising the most important kinds of traceability links for various development tasks have been synthesized.

Most reported single-stage PFC rectifiers cascade a boost-type converter with a forward or a flyback DC-DC converter so that input current shaping, isolation, and fast output voltage regulation are performed in one single stage. The cost and performance of single-stage PFC converters depend greatly on how its input current shaper (ICS) and the DC-DC converter are integrated together. For the cascade connected single-stage PFC rectifiers, the energy storage capacitor is found in either series or parallel path of energy flow. The second group appears to represent the main stream. Therefore, the focus of this paper is on the second group. It is found that many of these topologies can be implemented by combining a two-terminal or three-terminal boost ICS cell with DC-DC converter along with an energy storage capacitor in between. A general rule is observed that translates a three-terminal ICS cell to a two-terminal ICS cell using an additional winding from the transformer and vice verse. According to the translation rule, many of the reported single-stage PFC topologies can be viewed as electrically equivalent to one another.

As a consequence of the time-varying channel, the orthogonality between subcarriers is destroyed in conventional frequency-domain approaches, resulting in interchannel interference, which increases an irreducible error floor in proportion to the normalized Doppler frequency. An important feature of the proposed technique is the ability to exploit the time-selective channel as a provider of time diversity. This enables us to achieve performance superior to any other structure without increasing bandwidth or incorporating redundancy, in order to reduce the complexity of the estimator, we apply the theory of optimal low rank approximation to a minimum mean squared error channel estimator and present a theoretical calculation of mean squared error and simulations to confirm that the estimator is robust to changes in channel characteristics.","1558-0857","","10.1109/26.939860","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=939860","","Channel estimation;Signal detection;Time domain analysis;Frequency estimation;Fading;Time-varying channels;Interchannel interference;Bandwidth;Redundancy;Robustness","Rayleigh channels;signal detection;time-domain analysis;estimation theory;time-varying channels;least mean squares methods;radio receivers;equalisers","channel estimation;multicarrier signals;fast Rayleigh fading channels;selective Rayleigh fading channels;time-domain channel estimation;time-varying channel;orthogonality;subcarriers;interchannel interference;irreducible error floor;normalized Doppler frequency;time-selective channel;time diversity;performance;redundancy;minimum mean squared error channel estimator","","398","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Forney","Lab. for Inf. & Decision Syst., MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA","IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","","2001","47","2","520","548","A generalized state realization of the Wiberg (1996) type is called normal if symbol variables have degree 1 and state variables have degree 2. A natural graphical model of such a realization has leaf edges representing symbols, ordinary edges representing states, and vertices representing local constraints. Such a graph can be decoded by any version of the sum-product algorithm. Any state realization of a code can be put into normal form without essential change in the corresponding graph or in its decoding complexity. Group or linear codes are generated by group or linear state realizations. On a cycle-free graph, there exists a well-defined minimal canonical realization, and the sum-product algorithm is exact. However, the cut-set bound shows that graphs with cycles may have a superior performance-complexity tradeoff, although the sum-product algorithm is then inexact and iterative, and minimal realizations are not well-defined. Efficient cyclic and cycle-free realizations of Reed-Muller (RM) codes are given as examples. The dual of a normal group realization, appropriately defined, generates the dual group code. The dual realization has the same graph topology as the primal realization, replaces symbol and state variables by their character groups, and replaces primal local constraints by their duals. This fundamental result has many applications, including to dual state spaces, dual minimal trellises, duals to Tanner (1981) graphs, dual input/output (I/O) systems, and dual kernel and image representations. Finally a group code may be decoded using the dual graph, with appropriate Fourier transforms of the inputs and outputs; this can simplify decoding of high-rate codes.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.910573","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910573","","Dual codes","dual codes;group codes;linear codes;cyclic codes;Reed-Solomon codes;graph theory;decoding;computational complexity","codes on graphs;normal realizations;generalized state realization;symbol variables;state variables;graphical model;leaf edges;ordinary edges;vertices;local constraints;sum-product algorithm;decoding complexity;linear codes;group codes;cycle-free graph;minimal canonical realization;cut-set bound;performance-complexity tradeoff;iterative algorithm;Reed-Muller codes;normal group realization;dual group code;graph topology;primal realization;character groups;dual state spaces;dual minimal trellises;Tanner graphs;dual input/output systems;dual kernel representation;Fourier transforms;high-rate codes;cyclic codes","","332","","50","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Following a thorough singular value and eigenvalue analysis of the system dynamic interactions, five control sites consisting of four generators and one synchronous condenser are chosen to implement new power system stabilizers with a supplementary input from remote phasor measuring units, geographically spread over nine electrically coherent areas. Since the remote feedback loops are built on top of an existing decentralized control system, this design approach results in a decentralized/hierarchical control architecture with significant advantages in terms of reliability and operational flexibility. A systematic control and measurement pairing yielded four dominant natural loops, each associated with a significant open-loop inter-area oscillatory mode at 0.06, 0.4, 0.7 and 0.95 Hz respectively. These PSSs have a speed sensitive local loop operating in the usual way, and a wide-area measurement based global loop which involves a single differential frequency signal between two suitably selected areas. The tuning and coordination technique for these advanced multiple input signals PSSs is described. Their impacts on the system is assessed using both small-signal analysis and nonlinear simulations in a transient stability program. Wide-area stabilizing controllers have a significant potential in improving the dynamic performance of the Hydro-Quebec's existing power system.","1558-0679","","10.1109/59.910791","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910791","","Wide area measurements;Power system stability;Power system dynamics;Control systems;Power system analysis computing;Open loop systems;Power system simulation;Power system transients;Frequency synchronization;Voltage","power transmission control;power system stability;power system measurement;voltage control;voltage regulators;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;feedback;oscillations","wide-area measurement;stabilizing control;large power systems;hierarchical approach;decentralized approach;synchronized phasor measurement technology;Hydro-Quebec transmission system;voltage regulators;eigenvalue analysis;singular value analysis;system dynamic interactions;generators;synchronous condenser;power system stabilizers;remote phasor measuring units;electrically coherent areas;remote feedback loops;dominant natural loops;open-loop inter-area oscillatory mode;speed sensitive local loop;differential frequency signal;coordination technique;tuning technique;small-signal analysis;nonlinear simulations;transient stability program;wide-area stabilizing controllers","","407","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, we apply the quantization technique and orthogonal design to tailor a new crossover operator, such that this crossover operator can generate a small, but representative sample of points as the potential offspring.

OLSR is an optimization over a pure link state protocol as it compacts the size of information sent in the messages, and furthermore, reduces the number of retransmissions to flood these messages in an entire network. For this purpose, the protocol uses the multipoint relaying technique to efficiently and economically flood its control messages.

Noise analysis is further complicated by the time-varying circuit models, the fact that the reset transistor operates in subthreshold during reset, and the nonlinearity of the charge to voltage conversion, which is becoming more pronounced as CMOS technology scales. The paper presents a detailed and rigorous analysis of temporal noise due to thermal and shot noise sources in CMOS active pixel sensor (APS) that takes into consideration these complicating factors. Performing time-domain analysis, instead of the more traditional frequency-domain analysis, we find that the reset noise power due to thermal noise is at most half of its commonly quoted kT/C value. This result is corroborated by several published experimental data including data presented in this paper. The lower reset noise, however, comes at the expense of image lag. We find that alternative reset methods such as overdriving the reset transistor gate or using a pMOS transistor can alleviate lag, but at the expense of doubling the reset noise power. We propose a new reset method that alleviates lag without increasing reset noise.","1558-173X","","10.1109/4.896233","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896233","","Active noise reduction;Photodiodes;Circuit noise;CMOS image sensors;CMOS technology;Image sensors;Lighting;Charge-coupled image sensors;Photodetectors;Pixel","CMOS image sensors;photodiodes;integrated circuit noise;shot noise;1/f noise;thermal noise;time-domain analysis;network analysis","temporal noise analysis;CMOS photodiode active pixel sensor;image sensor performance;low illumination;video applications;thermal noise;1/f noise;time-varying circuit models;reset transistor;subthreshold operation;charge to voltage conversion nonlinearity;shot noise;time-domain analysis;reset noise power;image lag;reset method","","232","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown that for the symmetric DG device, ""volume inversion"" only occurs under subthreshold conditions, with a slightly negative impact on performance. Comparisons under the same off-state conditions show that the on-state inversion charge density of an asymmetric DG with one channel is only slightly less than that of a symmetric DG with two channels, if the silicon film is thin. From the analytic solutions, explicit expressions for the various components of the equivalent capacitance circuit are derived for symmetric and asymmetric DG devices.

The need to build forecasting models is eliminated, and better trading performance is obtained. The direct reinforcement approach differs from dynamic programming and reinforcement algorithms such as TD-learning and Q-learning, which attempt to estimate a value function for the control problem. We find that the RRL direct reinforcement framework enables a simpler problem representation, avoids Bellman's curse of dimensionality and offers compelling advantages in efficiency. We demonstrate how direct reinforcement can be used to optimize risk-adjusted investment returns (including the differential Sharpe ratio), while accounting for the effects of transaction costs. In extensive simulation work using real financial data, we find that our approach based on RRL produces better trading strategies than systems utilizing Q-learning (a value function method).

The proposed receiver implements a dual-gain-stage folded-cascode architecture which allows a 1.2-Gb/s transmission speed with the minimum common-mode and differential voltage at the input. The circuits were implemented in a 3.3-V 0.35-/spl mu/m CMOS technology in a couple of test chips.

In order for an LSMA-based estimator to produce accurate amounts of material abundance, it generally requires two constraints imposed on the linear mixture model used in LSMA, which are the abundance sum-to-one constraint and the abundance nonnegativity constraint. The first constraint requires the sum of the abundance fractions of materials present in an image pixel to be one and the second imposes a constraint that these abundance fractions be nonnegative. While the first constraint is easy to deal with, the second constraint is difficult to implement since it results in a set of inequalities and can only be solved by numerical methods. Consequently, most LSMA-based methods are unconstrained and produce solutions that do not necessarily reflect the true abundance fractions of materials. In this case, they can only be used for the purposes of material detection, discrimination, and classification, but not for material quantification. The authors present a fully constrained least squares (FCLS) linear spectral mixture analysis method for material quantification. Since no closed form can be derived for this method, an efficient algorithm is developed to yield optimal solutions. In order to further apply the designed algorithm to unknown image scenes, an unsupervised least squares error (LSE)-based method is also proposed to extend the FCLS method in an unsupervised manner.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.911111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=911111","","Least squares methods;Spectral analysis;Pixel;Hyperspectral sensors;Hyperspectral imaging;Image analysis;Remote sensing;Layout;Image processing;Algorithm design and analysis","geophysical techniques;geophysical signal processing;remote sensing;multidimensional signal processing;least squares approximations;image processing;image colour analysis","geophysical measurement technique;remote sensing;multispectral method;hyperspectral imaging;multidimensional signal processing;fully constrained least squares;linear spectral mixture analysis;material quantification;hyperspectral imagery;constraint;abundance fraction;algorithm;unsupervised least squares error;visible region;optical imaging;image processing","","1012","","39","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thanks to the closed-loop operation, full compensation of the desired harmonics is achieved even in the presence of a significant delay in the current control. Thanks to the selective approach, active filter interactions with possible dynamic components of the load are minimized. Moreover, the complexity of the synchronous frame controllers is overcome using equivalent stationary frame controllers.

Dynamic power management (DPM) is an effective tool in reducing system power consumption without significantly degrading performance. The basic idea is to shut down devices when not needed and wake them up when necessary. DPM, in general, is not a trivial problem. If the energy and performance overheads in sleep-state transition were negligible, then a simple greedy algorithm that makes the system enter the deepest sleep state when idling would be perfect. However, in reality, sleep-state transitioning has the overhead of storing processor state and turning off power. Waking up also takes a finite amount of time. Therefore, implementing the correct policy for sleep-state transitioning is critical for DPM success. It is argued that power-aware methodology uses an embedded microoperating system to reduce node energy consumption by exploiting both sleep state and active power management.","1558-1918","","10.1109/54.914626","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=914626","","Energy management;Intelligent networks;Wireless sensor networks;Power system management;Voltage control;Frequency;Power system modeling;Computer network management;Energy consumption;Central Processing Unit","microsensors;radio access networks;algorithm theory","dynamic power management;wireless sensor networks;sensor nodes;greedy algorithm;sleep-state transitioning;embedded microoperating system","","443","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

However, if even a very small part of photovoltaic module (PV module) is prevented from receiving light, the generation power of the PV module is decreased disproportionately. This greater than expected decrease occurs because PV modules which do not receive adequate light cannot operate on the normal operating point, but rather operate as loads. As a result, the total power from the PV modules is decreased if even only a small part of the PV modules are shaded. In the present paper, a novel circuit, referred to as the generation control circuit (GCC), which enables maximum power to be obtained from all of the PV modules even if some of the modules are prevented from receiving light. The proposed circuit enables the individual PV modules to operate effectively at the maximum power point tracking, irrespective of the series connected PV module system. In addition, the total generated power is shown experimentally to increase for the experimental set-up used in the present study.","1941-0107","","10.1109/63.923760","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=923760","","Circuits;Photovoltaic systems;Solar power generation;Power generation;Power generation economics;Inverters;Lighting control;Costs;Voltage;Choppers","photovoltaic power systems;solar cell arrays;power system control;optimal control;invertors;DC-AC power convertors;choppers (circuits);control system synthesis;control system analysis","photovoltaic modules;generation control circuit;inverter;operating point;maximum power generation;PV power systems;control design;control simulation;control performance","","289","","4","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method is based on two recent results on scale space: (1) Interest points can be adapted to scale and give repeatable results (geometrically stable). (2) Local extrema over scale of normalized derivatives indicate the presence of characteristic local structures. Our method first computes a multi-scale representation for the Harris interest point detector. We then select points at which a local measure (the Laplacian) is maximal over scales. This allows a selection of distinctive points for which the characteristic scale is known. These points are invariant to scale, rotation and translation as well as robust to illumination changes and limited changes of viewpoint. For indexing, the image is characterized by a set of scale invariant points; the scale associated with each point allows the computation of a scale invariant descriptor. Our descriptors are, in addition, invariant to image rotation, of affine illumination changes and robust to small perspective deformations. Experimental results for indexing show an excellent performance up to a scale factor of 4 for a database with more than 5000 images.","","0-7695-1143-0","10.1109/ICCV.2001.937561","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=937561","","Indexing;Robustness;Detectors;Laplace equations;Lighting;Image databases;Layout;Filters","database indexing;computer vision","scale invariant interest points;indexing;normalized derivatives;multi-scale representation;Harris interest point detector;scale invariant points;affine illumination changes","","493","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"The double-directional radio channel","M. Steinbauer; A. F. Molisch; E. Bonek","Inst. fur Nachrichtentech. und Hochfrequenztech., Tech. Univ. Wien, Austria; NA; NA","IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","","2001","43","4","51","63","We introduce the concept of the double-directional mobile radio channel. It is called this because it includes angular information at both link ends, e.g., at the base station and at the mobile station. We show that this angular information can be obtained with synchronized antenna arrays at both link ends. In wideband high-resolution measurements, we use a switched linear array at the receiver and a virtual-cross array at the transmitter. We evaluate the raw measurement data with a technique that alternately used estimation and beamforming, and that relied on ESPRIT (estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques) to obtain superresolution in both angular domains and in the delay domain. In sample microcellular scenarios (open and closed courtyard, line-of-sight and obstructed line-of-sight), up to 50 individual propagation paths are determined. The major multipath components are matched precisely to the physical environment by geometrical considerations. Up to three reflection/scattering points per propagation path are identified and localized, lending insight into the multipath spreading properties in a microcell. The extracted multipath parameters allow unambiguous scatterer identification and channel characterization, independently of a specific antenna, its configuration (single/array), and its pattern. The measurement results demonstrate a considerable amount of power being carried via multiply reflected components, thus suggesting revisiting the popular single-bounce propagation models. It turns out that the wideband double-directional evaluation is a most complete method for separating multipath components. Due to its excellent spatial resolution, the double-directional concept provides accurate estimates of the channel's multipath-richness, which is the important parameter for the capacity of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels.","1558-4143","","10.1109/74.951559","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=951559","","Antenna measurements;Delay estimation;Antenna arrays;Wideband;Linear antenna arrays;Spatial resolution;MIMO;Land mobile radio;Base stations;Radio transmitters","microcellular radio;multipath channels;transmitting antennas;receiving antennas;linear antenna arrays;array signal processing;parameter estimation;MIMO systems;millimetre wave antenna arrays;millimetre wave propagation","double-directional radio channel;double-directional mobile radio channel;angular information;synchronized antenna arrays;wideband high-resolution measurements;switched linear array;virtual-cross array;receiver;transmitter;ESPRIT;estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques;superresolution;delay domain;microcellular scenarios;open courtyard;closed courtyard;line-of-sight;obstructed line-of-sight;propagation paths;multipath components;reflection point;scattering points;scatterer identification;channel characterization;multiply reflected components;single-bounce propagation models;spatial resolution;multiple-input multiple-output channels;MIMO channels;5.2 GHz","","340","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The utilization of these energy sources can significantly reduce the system fuel costs but can also have considerable impact on the system reliability.

Traditional routing protocols do not take into account that a node contains only a limited energy supply. Optimal routing tries to maximize the duration over which the sensing task can be performed, but requires future knowledge. As this is unrealistic, we derive a practical guideline based on the energy histogram and develop a spectrum of new techniques to enhance the routing in sensor networks. Our first approach aggregates packet streams in a robust way, resulting in energy reductions of a factor 2 to 3. Second, we argue that a more uniform resource utilization can be obtained by shaping the traffic flow. Several techniques, which rely only on localized metrics are proposed and evaluated.

Network generalization capabilities of the stochastic network maintain a squared error within 10 percent of that of a floating-point implementation for a wide range of noise levels.

The study of mechanical legged motion has been motivated by its potential use as a means of locomotion in rough terrain, as well as its potential benefits to prothesis development and testing. The paper concentrates on issues related to the automatic control of biped robots. More precisely, its primary goal is to contribute a means to prove asymptotically-stable walking in planar, underactuated biped robot models. Since normal walking can be viewed as a periodic solution of the robot model, the method of Poincare sections is the natural means to study asymptotic stability of a walking cycle. However, due to the complexity of the associated dynamic models, this approach has had limited success. The principal contribution of the present work is to show that the control strategy can be designed in a way that greatly simplifies the application of the method of Poincare to a class of biped models, and, in fact, to reduce the stability assessment problem to the calculation of a continuous map from a subinterval of R to itself. The mapping in question is directly computable from a simulation model. The stability analysis is based on a careful formulation of the robot model as a system with impulse effects and the extension of the method of Poincare sections to this class of models.","1558-2523","","10.1109/9.898695","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=898695","","Legged locomotion;Sliding mode control;Robotics and automation;Robots;Torque control;Asymptotic stability;Biology computing;Control design;Control systems;Oscillators","legged locomotion;asymptotic stability;limit cycles;robot dynamics;nonlinear control systems","asymptotically stable walking;biped robots;impulse effects;walking robots;legged robots;mechanical legged motion;rough terrain;automatic control;planar underactuated robot models;Poincare sections;walking cycle;stability assessment problem;continuous map","","630","","59","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, from space, large antennas (several meters) are required to achieve an adequate spatial resolution at L-band. So as to reduce the problem of putting into orbit a large filled antenna, the possibility of using antenna synthesis methods has been investigated. Such a system, relying on a deployable structure, has now proved to be feasible and has led to the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, which is described. The main objective of the SMOS mission is to deliver key variables of the land surfaces (soil moisture fields), and of ocean surfaces (sea surface salinity fields). The SMOS mission is based on a dual polarized L-band radiometer using aperture synthesis (two-dimensional [2D] interferometer) so as to achieve a ground resolution of 50 km at the swath edges coupled with multiangular acquisitions. The radiometer will enable frequent and global coverage of the globe and deliver surface soil moisture fields over land and sea surface salinity over the oceans. The SMOS mission was proposed to the European Space Agency (ESA) in the framework of the Earth Explorer Opportunity Missions. It was selected for a tentative launch in 2005. The goal of this paper is to present the main aspects of the baseline mission and describe how soil moisture will be retrieved from SMOS data.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.942551","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=942551","","Soil moisture;Oceans;SMOS mission;Microwave radiometry;L-band;Surface soil;Sea surface salinity;Frequency estimation;Microwave theory and techniques;Spatial resolution","soil;moisture measurement;terrain mapping;hydrological techniques;hydrological equipment;remote sensing;radiometry;radiometers;satellite antennas;microwave antennas","soil moisture;hydrology;satellite remote sensing;microwave radiometry;radiometer;instrument;terrain mapping;land surface;Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity mission;SMOS;UHF;L-band;aperture synthesis;antenna synthesis;deployable structure;two dimensional interferometer;measurement technique;1.4 GHz","","1032","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The advantage of proposed tracking control design is that only a simple fuzzy controller is used in our approach without feedback linearization technique and complicated adaptive scheme. By the proposed method, the fuzzy tracking control design problem is parameterized in terms of a linear matrix inequality problem (LMIP).

Due to its open architecture and achieved scale, Gnutella is an interesting P2P architecture case study. Gnutella, like most other P2P applications, builds at the application level a virtual network with its own routing mechanisms. The topology of this overlay network and the routing mechanisms used have a significant influence on application properties such as performance, reliability, and scalability. We built a 'crawler' to extract the topology of Gnutella's application level network, we analyze the topology graph and evaluate generated network traffic. We find that although Gnutella is not a pure power-law network, its current configuration has the benefits and drawbacks of a power-law structure. These findings lead us to propose changes to the Gnutella protocol and implementations that bring significant performance and scalability improvements.","","0-7695-1503-7","10.1109/P2P.2001.990433","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=990433","","Peer to peer computing;Computer aided software engineering;Network topology;Routing;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Application software;Computer architecture;Mechanical factors;Scalability","telecommunication network routing;open systems;Internet;protocols;computer network reliability","peer-to-peer architecture;Gnutella network;open architecture;virtual network;routing mechanisms;overlay network topology;performance;reliability;scalability;crawler;topology graph;network traffic","","108","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Design and implementation of the extended Kalman filter for the speed and rotor position estimation of brushless DC motor","B. Terzic; M. Jadric","Fac. of Electr. Eng., Mech. & Naval Archit., Univ. of Split, Croatia; NA","IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","","2001","48","6","1065","1073","A method for speed and rotor position estimation of a brushless DC motor (BLDCM) is presented in this paper. An extended Kalman filter (EKF) is employed to estimate the motor state variables by only using measurements of the stator fine voltages and currents. When applying the EKF, it was necessary to solve some specific problems related to the voltage and current waveforms of the BLDCM. During the estimation procedure, the voltage- and current-measuring signals are not filtered, which is otherwise usually done when applying similar methods. The voltage average value during the sampling interval is obtained by combining measurements and calculations, owing to the application of the predictive current controller which is based on the mathematical model of motor. Two variants of the estimation algorithm are considered: (1) speed and rotor position are estimated with constant motor parameters and (2) the stator resistance is estimated simultaneously with motor state variables. In order to verify the estimation results, the laboratory setup has been constructed using a motor with ratings of 1.5 kW, 2000 r/min, fed by an insulated gate bipolar transistor inverter. The speed and current controls, as well as the estimation algorithm, have been implemented by a digital signal processor (TMS320C50). The experimental results show that is possible to estimate the speed and rotor position of the BLDCM with sufficient accuracy in both steady-state and dynamic operation. Introducing the estimation of the stator resistance, the speed estimation accuracy is increased, particularly at low speeds. At the end of the paper, the characteristics of the sensorless drive are analyzed. A sensorless speed control system has been achieved with maximum steady-state error between reference and actual motor speed of /spl plusmn/1% at speeds above 5% of the rated value.","1557-9948","","10.1109/41.969385","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=969385","","Brushless DC motors;DC motors;State estimation;Rotors;Stators;Voltage;Current measurement;Signal processing algorithms;Steady-state;Sampling methods","brushless DC motors;Kalman filters;electric current control;predictive control;insulated gate bipolar transistors;stators;electric resistance;digital signal processing chips;machine control;DC motor drives;rotors;angular velocity control;parameter estimation","brushless DC motor;rotor position estimation;extended Kalman filter;speed estimation;stator fine voltages;stator fine currents;current-measuring signals;voltage-measuring signals;predictive current controller;mathematical model;stator resistance estimation;insulated gate bipolar transistor inverter;digital signal processor;TMS320C50;steady-state operation;dynamic operation;sensorless drive;sensorless speed control system;1.5 kW","","88","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These two algorithms are complementary in terms of applicability, and they produce accurate stability information for single-loop networks. After a brief primer on feedback and stability, we review Bode's feedback theory, where the return difference and return ratio concepts are applicable to general feedback configurations and avoid the necessity of identifying μ and /spl beta/. Middlebrook's null double-injection technique, which provides a laboratory-based way to measure return ratio, is then discussed in the modern circuit analysis context; we then extend the unilateral feedback-model used in Middlebrook's approach to accommodate both normal-and reverse-loop transmission and characterize the return loop using a general two-port-analysis. This loop-based two-port algorithm determines the stability of a feedback network in which a critical wire can be located to break all return loops. The device-based gain-nulling algorithm is then discussed to evaluate the influence of the local return loops upon network stability. This algorithm determines the stability of a feedback network in which a controlled source can be nulled to render the network to be passive. Conditions under which these two algorithms can be applied are discussed.","1558-1888","","10.1109/101.900125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=900125","","Circuit stability;Frequency;Stability analysis;Output feedback;Feedback circuits;Oscillators;Poles and zeros;Voltage;Gain measurement;Information analysis","circuit stability;Bode diagrams;two-port networks;circuit feedback;frequency-domain analysis;linear network analysis","small-signal stability;Bode's definition;return ratio;loop-based two-port algorithm;device-based gain-nulling;single-loop networks;return difference;null double-injection technique;unilateral feedback-model;reverse-loop transmission;general two-port-analysis;feedback network;critical wire;network stability","","33","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Experiments using spatial, polarization, and pattern diversity were conducted for both line-of-sight (LOS) and obstructed outdoor and indoor multipath channels that experienced Ricean fading. Antenna separation, polarization, and pattern were varied independently to the extent possible. Envelope correlation, power imbalance, and diversity gain were calculated from the measurements. Diversity performance is measured by diversity gain, which is the difference in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) between the output of a diversity combiner and the signal on a single branch, measured at a given probability level. Diversity gain increases with decreasing envelope correlation between the antenna diversity branches. However, diversity gain decreases as the power imbalance between diversity branches increases because a branch that has a weak signal has only a small contribution to the combined signal. Diversity gain values of 7-9 dB at the 99% reliability level were achieved in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channels for all diversity configurations even with very small antenna spacings. The use of polarization diversity reduced polarization mismatches, improving SNR by up to 12 dB even in LOS channels.","1558-2221","","10.1109/8.947018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=947018","","Polarization;Diversity methods;Antennas and propagation;Antenna measurements;Gain measurement;Directive antennas;Base stations;Fading;Receiving antennas;Telephone sets","radio equipment;telecommunication terminals;land mobile radio;diversity reception;mobile antennas;electromagnetic wave polarisation;multipath channels;antenna radiation patterns;noise;correlation methods;antenna arrays;Rician channels;antenna testing","pattern diversity;wireless handheld terminals;polarization diversity;spatial diversity;antenna diversity configurations;performance;handheld radios;LOS indoor multipath channels;line-of-sight outdoor multipath channels;obstructed outdoor multipath channels;Rician fading;obstructed indoor multipath channels;antenna separation;antenna polarization;antenna pattern;envelope correlation;power imbalance;diversity gain;measurements;diversity performance;signal-to-noise ratio;SNR;diversity combiner;probability level;antenna diversity branches;reliability level;nonline-of-sight channels;NLOS channels;polarization mismatch reduction;handheld antenna array testbed","","297","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We find the general form of power, BER and data rate adaptation that maximizes spectral efficiency for a large class of modulation techniques and fading distributions. The optimal adaptation of these parameters is to increase the power and data rate and decrease the BER as the channel quality improves. Surprisingly, little spectral efficiency is lost when the power or rate is constrained to be constant. Hence, the spectral efficiency of adaptive modulation is relatively insensitive to which degrees of freedom are adapted.","1558-0857","","10.1109/26.950343","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=950343","","Bit error rate;Fading;Modulation coding;Constellation diagram;Power system reliability;Channel estimation;Feedback;Transmitters;Estimation error;Delay estimation","adaptive modulation;error statistics;Rayleigh channels;quadrature amplitude modulation","degrees of freedom;adaptive modulation;flat-fading channels;data rate;transmit power;instantaneous BER;spectral efficiency;average power;continuous-rate adaptation;discrete-rate adaptation;optimal adaptation;channel quality;wireless networks","","815","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We show that the link-level performance of a HARQ type-II system can be significantly better with IR compared to Chase combining. The largest gains are obtained for high channel-coding rates and high modulation orders. For low modulation and coding schemes (MCS), the link-level performance gains with IR are less significant. We further show that in a system that uses link adaptation we can not expect any large gains with IR as long as the link adaptation errors are reasonably small.

However, this protocol was not designed for multihop networks. Although it can support some ad hoc network architecture, it is not intended to support the wireless mobile ad hoc network, in which multihop connectivity is one of the most prominent features. In this article we focus on the following question: can the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol function well in multihop networks? By presenting several serious problems encountered in an IEEE 802.11-based multihop network and revealing the in-depth cause of these problems, we conclude that the current version of this wireless LAN protocol does not function well in multihop ad hoc networks. We thus doubt whether the WaveLAN-based system is workable as a mobile ad hoc testbed.","1558-1896","","10.1109/35.925681","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=925681","","Media Access Protocol;Wireless application protocol;Intelligent networks;Spread spectrum communication;Ad hoc networks;Multiaccess communication;Wireless LAN;Cascading style sheets;Access protocols;Cyclic redundancy check","IEEE standards;telecommunication standards;access protocols;wireless LAN;land mobile radio;digital simulation","IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol;multihop wireless ad hoc networks;wireless LAN standard;simulations;wireless mobile ad hoc network;multihop connectivity;wireless LAN protocol;WaveLAN-based system;mobile ad hoc testbed","","618","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Additionally, heterogeneous integration of different technologies in one single chip is becoming increasingly desirable, for which planar (two-dimensional) ICs may not be suitable. This paper analyzes the limitations of the existing interconnect technologies and design methodologies and presents a novel three-dimensional (3-D) chip design strategy that exploits the vertical dimension to alleviate the interconnect related problems and to facilitate heterogeneous integration of technologies to realize a system-on-a-chip (SoC) design. A comprehensive analytical treatment of these 3-D ICs has been presented and it has been shown that by simply dividing a planar chip into separate blocks, each occurring a separate physical level interconnected by short and vertical interlayer interconnects (VILICs), significant improvement in performance and reduction in wire-limited chip area can be achieved, without the aid of any other circuit or design innovations. A scheme to optimize the interconnect distribution among different interconnect tiers is presented and the effect of transferring the repeaters to upper Si layers has been quantified in this analysis for a two-layer 3-D chip. Furthermore, one of the major concerns in 3-D ICs arising due to power dissipation problems has been analyzed and an analytical model has been presented to estimate the temperatures of the different active layers. It is demonstrated that advancement in heat sinking technology will be necessary in order to extract maximum performance from these chips. Implications of 3-D device architecture on several design issues have also been discussed with special attention to SoC design strategies. Finally some of the promising technologies for manufacturing 3-D ICs have been outlined.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.929647","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=929647","","Chip scale packaging;Integrated circuit interconnections;System-on-a-chip;Very large scale integration;Wire;Integrated circuit technology;Design methodology;Performance analysis;Technological innovation;Repeaters","VLSI;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit modelling","VLSI chip design;deep-submicron interconnect;heterogeneous integration;three-dimensional integrated circuit;system-on-a-chip;vertical interlayer interconnect;analytical model","","696","","132","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Enterprise resource planning (ERP) packages are often viewed as off-the-shelf software, because adopters implement them by setting parameters (called configuration), rather traditional programming. Making changes to ERP software code (called modification) is usually strongly discouraged by vendors and implementation consultants. Nevertheless, field research has shown that many companies have had to modify ERP software in various ways to meet essential business needs. This suggests that ERP packages do not fit cleanly into the custom/off-the shelf distinction. The authors describe a portfolio of tailoring options between configuration and modification, with important implications for implementation risk and the difficulty of ERP system upgrades.

The Bluetooth specifications (currently in version 1.1) define a radiofrequency (RF) wireless communication interface and the associated set of communication protocols and usage profiles. The link speed, communication range and transmission power level for Bluetooth were chosen to support low-cost, power-efficient, single-chip implementations of the current technology. In fact, Bluetooth is the first attempt at making a single-chip radio that can operate in the 2.4-GHz ISM (industrial, scientific and medical) RF band. While most early Bluetooth solutions are dual-chip, vendors have recently announced single-chip versions as well.

Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, USA","Proceedings 42nd IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","","2001","","","136","145","We propose a novel paradigm for defining security of cryptographic protocols, called universally composable security. The salient property of universally composable definitions of security is that they guarantee security even when a secure protocol is composed of an arbitrary set of protocols, or more generally when the protocol is used as a component of an arbitrary system. This is an essential property for maintaining security of cryptographic protocols in complex and unpredictable environments such as the Internet. In particular, universally composable definitions guarantee security even when an unbounded number of protocol instances are executed concurrently in an adversarially controlled manner, they guarantee non-malleability with respect to arbitrary protocols, and more. We show how to formulate universally composable definitions of security for practically any cryptographic task. Furthermore, we demonstrate that practically any such definition can be realized using known techniques, as long as only a minority of the participants are corrupted. We then proceed to formulate universally composable definitions of a wide array of cryptographic tasks, including authenticated and secure communication, key-exchange, public-key encryption, signature, commitment, oblivious transfer, zero knowledge and more. We also make initial steps towards studying the realizability of the proposed definitions in various settings.","1552-5244","0-7695-1390-5","10.1109/SFCS.2001.959888","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=959888","","Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Mathematical model;Computer security;Application software;Radio access networks;Reactive power;Job design;Computer science","bibliographies;cryptography;protocols;message authentication;computability","universally composable security;cryptographic protocol paradigm;universally composable definitions;secure protocol;arbitrary system;complex unpredictable environments;Internet;adversarially controlled execution;non-malleability;arbitrary protocols;cryptographic task;authenticated communication;secure communication;key-exchange;public-key encryption;oblivious transfer;zero knowledge;concurrent composition","","955","","61","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Loop-freedom is guaranteed by using a notion of ""advertised hopcount"". Link-disjointness of multiple paths is achieved by using a particular property of flooding.

This perspective is particularly useful in studying complex nonlinear systems by decomposing them into simpler subsystems that, upon interconnection, add up their energies to determine the full system's behavior. The action of a controller may also be understood in energy terms as another dynamical system. The control problem can then be recast as finding a dynamical system and an interconnection pattern such that the overall energy function takes the desired form. This energy-shaping approach is the essence of passivity-based control (PBC), a controller design technique that is very well known in mechanical systems. Our objectives in the article are threefold. First, to call attention to the fact that PBC does not rely on some particular structural properties of mechanical systems, but hinges on the more fundamental (and universal) property of energy balancing. Second, to identify the physical obstacles that hamper the use of standard PBC in applications other than mechanical systems. In particular, we show that standard PBC is stymied by the presence of unbounded energy dissipation, hence it is applicable only to systems that are stabilizable with passive controllers. Third, to revisit a PBC theory that has been developed to overcome the dissipation obstacle as well as to make the incorporation of process prior knowledge more systematic. These two important features allow us to design energy-based controllers for a wide range of physical systems.","1941-000X","","10.1109/37.915398","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=915398","","Control systems;Mechanical systems;Nonlinear systems;Mechanical factors;Intelligent control;Performance gain;Lyapunov method;Nonlinear control systems;Fasteners;Energy dissipation","control system synthesis;intelligent control;stability;nonlinear control systems","energy-transformation devices;complex nonlinear systems;dynamical system;interconnection pattern;overall energy function;energy-shaping approach;passivity-based control;controller design technique;mechanical systems;passive controllers;unbounded energy dissipation;energy-based controllers;physical systems","","472","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

We compare the performance of two prominent on-demand routing protocols for mobile ad hoc networks: dynamic source routing (DSR) and ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing (AODV). A detailed simulation model with MAC and physical layer models is used to study interlayer interactions and their performance implications. We demonstrate that even though DSR and AODV share similar on-demand behavior, the differences in the protocol mechanics can lead to significant performance differentials. The performance differentials are analyzed using varying network load, mobility, and network size.

This work is motivated by the fact that the ability of a converter to perform effectively as an active filter is limited by the power and the frequency distribution of the distortion for which it must compensate. This system is comprised of a three-phase shunt active filter and series AC line smoothing reactance installed in front of the target load. The proposed system significantly reduces the required shunt active filter bandwidth. The space-vector pulse width modulation (PWM) controller is based on a dead-beat control model. It is implemented digitally using a single 16-bit microcontroller. This controller requires only the supply current to be monitored, an approach different from conventional methods. The paper provides background on the operation of the filter, the details of the power circuit, the details of the control design, representative waveforms, and spectral performance for a filter which supports a 15 kVA phase controlled rectifier load. Experimental data indicate that the active filter typically consumes 2% or less of the average load power, suggesting that a parallel filter is an efficient compensation approach. The spectral performance shows that the active filter brings the system into compliance with IEEE519-1992 up to the 33rd harmonic for an AC line smoothing reactance of 0.13 p.u.","1941-0107","","10.1109/63.903994","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=903994","","Active filters;Passive filters;Power filters;Space vector pulse width modulation;Smoothing methods;Power harmonic filters;Frequency conversion;Bandwidth;Power system modeling;Microcontrollers","power harmonic filters;compensation;active filters;PWM power convertors;harmonic distortion;electric reactance;microcontrollers;phase control;rectifying circuits","passive series active shunt filter;high power applications;high power nonlinear loads;converter;frequency distribution;distortion compensation;three-phase shunt active filter;series AC line smoothing reactance;required shunt active filter bandwidth;space-vector pulse width modulation controller;PWM controller;dead-beat control model;16-bit microcontroller;spectral performance;phase controlled rectifier load;average load power;parallel filter;IEEE519-1992;33rd harmonic;AC line smoothing reactance;power quality;15 kVA","","60","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The DGS on the ground plane provides an additional effective inductive component to the microstrip line. This enables the microstrip line to be realized with very high impedance of over 150 /spl Omega/. By employing the DGS to the unequal Wilkinson topology, 4:1 power dividing ratio can be obtained easily without any problem in realization, while it has been impractical to fabricate a 4:1 divider using the conventional microstrip line because of very thin conductor width and extremely low aspect ratio (W/H). As an example, a 4:1 divider has been designed and measured at 1.5 GHz in order to show the validity of the proposed DGS and unequal divider. The measured performances of the 4:1 unequal power divider well agree with the exactly same dividing ratio as that expected.","1558-1764","","10.1109/7260.915624","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=915624","","Power dividers;Microstrip;Impedance;Conductors;Power measurement;Performance evaluation;Topology;Inductance;Fabrication;Resistors","microstrip components;power dividers","unequal Wilkinson power divider;defected ground structure;microstrip line;aspect ratio;1.5 GHz","","164","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Group, Christian Albrechts Univ., Kiel, Germany; NA","IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","","2001","49","12","3136","3144","This paper introduces a two-dimensional (2-D) generalization of the analytic signal. This novel approach is based on the Riesz transform, which is used instead of the Hilbert transform. The combination of a 2-D signal with the Riesz transformed one yields a sophisticated 2-D analytic signal: the monogenic signal. The approach is derived analytically from irrotational and solenoidal vector fields. Based on local amplitude and local phase, an appropriate local signal representation that preserves the split of identity, i.e., the invariance-equivariance property of signal decomposition, is presented. This is one of the central properties of the one-dimensional (1-D) analytic signal that decomposes a signal into structural and energetic information. We show that further properties of the analytic signal concerning symmetry, energy, allpass transfer function, and orthogonality are also preserved, and we compare this with the behavior of other approaches for a 2-D analytic signal. As a central topic of this paper, a geometric phase interpretation that is based on the relation between the 1-D analytic signal and the 2-D monogenic signal established by the Radon (1986) transform is introduced. Possible applications of this relationship are sketched, and references to other applications of the monogenic signal are given.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.969520","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=969520","","Signal analysis;Signal processing;Band pass filters;Information analysis;Frequency estimation;Image edge detection;Radar signal processing;Image processing;Phase measurement;Information filtering","multidimensional signal processing;signal representation;Radon transforms;Hilbert transforms","monogenic signal;2D analytic signal;Riesz transform;irrotational vector fields;solenoidal vector fields;local amplitude representation;local phase representation;Hilbert transform;local signal representation;allpass transfer function;signal symmetry;signal energy;geometric phase interpretation;1D analytic signal;2D monogenic signal;Radon transform","","526","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed FLL contains a frequency-to-voltage converter (FVC), an operational amplifier (opamp) and a differential voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). The operation of the proposed circuit is based on frequency comparison of reference and feedback signals. The architecture of the FVC is built upon capacitor charge redistribution principle, whereas the architecture of the VCO is based on differential delay cells in order to minimize the effect of the power supply and the substrate noise. Simulation carried out with HSpice using the CMOS 0.35-/spl mu/m process shows that the FLL is very fast and operates over a wide frequency range. Two versions of the FLL are reported; the basic architecture could show a static offset due to the two employed FVCs. To alleviate this effect, a second version is proposed to completely eliminate the offset. The area of the proposed FLL is very small, and the design could be easily integrated in the same die together with other analog, digital and mixed-signal blocks. A functional test of five samples of a first version of this FLL proved that the proposed FLL works as expected from simulation results. Examples of the application of the proposed FLL are a high-precision VCO and a frequency synthesizer with true-fractional multiplication and division that does not require binary frequency dividers.","1558-125X","","10.1109/82.938354","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=938354","","Frequency locked loops;Voltage-controlled oscillators;Frequency conversion;Frequency synthesizers;Differential amplifiers;Operational amplifiers;Feedback circuits;Capacitors;Delay effects;Power supplies","voltage-frequency convertors;frequency synthesizers;voltage-controlled oscillators;CMOS integrated circuits;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;SPICE;circuit simulation","frequency-locked loop;CMOS frequency-to-voltage converter;operational amplifier;differential voltage-controlled oscillator;capacitor charge redistribution principle;differential delay cells;substrate noise;HSpice;mixed-signal blocks;high-precision VCO;frequency synthesizer;true-fractional multiplication;0.35 micron","","47","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There are two types of filter choices: orthogonal and biorthogonal. Orthogonal filters have the property that there are energy or norm preserving. Nevertheless, modern wavelet coders use biorthogonal filters which do not preserve energy. Reasons for these specific design choices are explained. Another purpose of this article is to compare and contrast ""early"" wavelet coding with ""modern"" wavelet coding. This article compares the techniques of the modern wavelet coders to the subband coding techniques so that the reader can appreciate how different modern wavelet coding is from early wavelet coding. It discusses basic properties of the wavelet transform which are pertinent to image compression. It builds on the background material in generic transform coding given, shows that boundary effects motivate the use of biorthogonal wavelets, and introduces the symmetric wavelet transform.

We review these dispersive properties and point out some of the inherent tradeoffs involved in generating large group delay. Fiber Bragg gratings and recent results on optical all-pass filters are used as examples.","1558-1713","","10.1109/3.914401","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=914401","","Optical filters;Delay lines;Fiber nonlinear optics;Nonlinear optics;Phased arrays;Delay effects;Resonance;Optical arrays;Dispersion;Radio frequency","optical delay lines;optical communication equipment;Bragg gratings;optical filters;optical arrays;all-pass filters;optical dispersion","optical delay lines;optical filters;optical communication systems;phased arrays;optical group delay;dispersive properties;group delay response;large group delay;fiber Bragg gratings;optical all-pass filters","","259","","60","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An image is represented by a set of regions, roughly corresponding to objects, which are characterized by color, texture, shape, and location. The system classifies images into semantic categories. Potentially, the categorization enhances retrieval by permitting semantically-adaptive searching methods and narrowing down the searching range in a database. A measure for the overall similarity between images is developed using a region-matching scheme that integrates properties of all the regions in the images. The application of SIMPLIcity to several databases has demonstrated that our system performs significantly better and faster than existing ones. The system is fairly robust to image alterations.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.955109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=955109","","Libraries;Image retrieval;Image databases;Information retrieval;Content based retrieval;Image segmentation;Image classification;Robustness;Image storage;Pixel","image retrieval;content-based retrieval;visual databases;image classification;feature extraction;image segmentation;pattern matching;pattern clustering;wavelet transforms","SIMPLIcity;content based image retrieval;semantics classification;wavelet;feature extraction;region matching;image segmentation;visual databases;clustering","","1247","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The increasing influence of interconnect parasitics on crosstalk noise and R(L)C delay as well as electromigration and power dissipation concerns have stimulated the introduction of low-resistivity copper and low-permittivity (k) dielectrics to provide performance and reliability enhancement. Integration of these new materials into integrated circuit fabrication is a formidable task, requiring material, process, design, and packaging innovations.

Distinction is made between strategies where maintenance consists of replacement by a new (or ""good as new"") component and where it is represented by a less costly activity resulting in a limited improvement of the component's condition. Methods are also divided into categories where maintenance is performed at fixed intervals and where it is carried out as needed. A further distinction is made between heuristic methods and those based on mathematical models; the models themselves can be deterministic or probabilistic. From a review of present maintenance policies in electric utilities, it is concluded that maintenance at fixed intervals is the most frequently used approach, often augmented by additional corrections. Newer ""as needed""-type methods, such as reliability-centered maintenance (RCM), are increasingly considered for application in North America, but methods based on mathematical models are hardly ever used or even considered. Yet only mathematical approaches where component deterioration and condition improvement by maintenance are quantitatively linked can determine the effect of maintenance on reliability. Although more complex, probabilistic models have advantages over deterministic ones: they are capable of describing actual processes more realistically, and also facilitate optimization for maximal reliability or minimal costs.","1558-0679","","10.1109/59.962408","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=962408","","Maintenance;Power system reliability;Mathematical model;Power industry;Power system modeling;North America;Cost function;Frequency;System performance;Degradation","electricity supply industry;maintenance engineering;power system reliability;optimisation","power system maintenance strategies;reliability impact;component replacement;heuristic methods;mathematical models;probabilistic models;deterministic models;electric utilities;fixed maintenance intervals;reliability-centered maintenance;North America","","209","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such patterns are very common in medical images. Vessel detection is interesting for the computation of parameters related to blood flow. Its tree-like geometry makes it a usable feature for registration between images that can be of a different nature. In order to define vessel-like patterns, segmentation is performed with respect to a precise model. We define a vessel as a bright pattern, piece-wise connected, and locally linear, mathematical morphology is very well adapted to this description, however other patterns fit such a morphological description. In order to differentiate vessels from analogous background patterns, a cross-curvature evaluation is performed. They are separated out as they have a specific Gaussian-like profile whose curvature varies smoothly along the vessel. The detection algorithm that derives directly from this modeling is based on four steps: (1) noise reduction; (2) linear pattern with Gaussian-like profile improvement; (3) cross-curvature evaluation; (4) linear filtering. We present its theoretical background and illustrate it on real images of various natures, then evaluate its robustness and its accuracy with respect to noise.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.931095","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=931095","","Morphology;Image segmentation;Working environment noise;Biomedical imaging;Blood flow;Geometry;Performance evaluation;Gaussian processes;Detection algorithms;Noise reduction","mathematical morphology;medical image processing;blood vessels;noise;interference suppression;image segmentation;edge detection;Gaussian processes;digital filters;eye","vessel-like patterns;mathematical morphology;curvature evaluation;noisy environment;medical images;vessel detection;blood flow;tree-like geometry;registration;Gaussian-like profile;detection algorithm;noise reduction;linear pattern;cross-curvature evaluation;linear filtering;blood vessels","","485","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, these methods are only applicable when projects are independent and are evaluated in a common funding cycle. When projects are interdependent, the complexity of optimizing even a moderate number of projects over a small number of objectives and constraints can become overwhelming. This paper presents a model developed for the Boeing Company, Seattle, WA, USA, to optimize a portfolio of product development improvement projects. Using a dependency matrix, which quantifies the interdependencies between projects, a nonlinear, integer program model was developed to optimize project selection. The model also balances risk, overall objectives and the cost and benefit of the entire portfolio.

Comm., Varese, Italy; NA","IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","2001","39","2","309","320","A new segmentation method based on the morphological characteristic of connected components in images is proposed. Theoretical definitions of morphological leveling and morphological spectrum are used in the formal definition of a morphological characteristic. In multiscale segmentation, this characteristic is formalized through the derivative of the morphological profile. Multiscale segmentation is particularly well suited for complex image scenes such as aerial or fine resolution satellite images, where very thin, enveloped and/or nested regions must be retained. The proposed method performs well in the presence of both low radiometric contrast and relatively low spatial resolution. Those factors may produce a textural effect, a border effect, and ambiguity in the object/background distinction.

Center, North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh, NC, USA","Proceedings of the IEEE","","2001","89","6","822","832","Power electronic systems have benefited greatly during the past ten years from the revolutionary advances that have occurred in power discrete devices. The introduction of power metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) in the 1970s and the insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) in the 1980s enabled design of very compact high-efficiency systems due to the greatly enhanced power gain resulting from the high input impedance of these structures. Recently, significant improvements in the performance of silicon-power MOSFETs has been achieved by using innovative vertical structures with charge coupled regions. Meanwhile, silicon IGBTs continue to dominate the medium- and high-voltage application space sue to scaling of their voltage ratings and refinements to their gate structure achieved by using very large scale integration (VLSI) technology and trench gate regions. Research on a variety of MOS-gated thyristors has also been conducted, resulting in some promising improvements in the tradeoff between on-state power loss, switching power loss, and the safe-operating-area. Concurrent improvements in power rectifiers have been achieved at low-voltage ratings using Schottky rectifier structures containing trenches and at high-voltage ratings using structures that combine junction and Schottky barrier contacts. On the longer term, silicon carbide Schottky rectifiers and power MOSFETs offer at least another tenfold improvement in performance. Although the projected performance enhancements have been experimentally demonstrated, the defect density and cost of the starting material are determining the pace of commercialization of this technology at present.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.931471","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=931471","","Power semiconductor devices;MOSFETs;Insulated gate bipolar transistors;Rectifiers;Space technology;Very large scale integration;Power electronics;FETs;Impedance;Silicon","power bipolar transistors;insulated gate bipolar transistors;power MOSFET;VLSI;MOS-controlled thyristors;AC-DC power convertors;rectifying circuits;power semiconductor switches","power semiconductor device technology future;MOSFETs;IGBTs;VLSI;very large scale integration;Schottky barrier contacts;Schottky rectifier;silicon power rectifiers;innovative vertical structures;charge coupled regions;MOS-gated thyristors;on-state power loss;switching power loss;safe-operating-area;defect density;technology commercialization","","99","","85","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Miller","NA","Computer","","2001","34","7","16","18","Increasingly, companies and individuals are using wireless technology for important communications they want to keep private, such as mobile e-commerce transactions, email, and corporate data transmissions. At the same time, as wireless platforms mature, grow in popularity, and store valuable information, hackers are stepping up their attacks on these new targets. This is a particular problem because wireless devices, including smart cellular phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs) with Internet access, were not originally designed with security as a top priority. Now, however, wireless security is becoming an important area of product research and development. As in the wired world, wireless security boils down to protecting information and preventing unauthorized system access. However, it is challenging to implement security in small-footprint devices with low processing power and small memory capacities and that use unreliable, low bandwidth wireless networks. Vendors and others have developed several security approaches for the various wireless technologies, although each of these early efforts has some shortcomings. Security researchers are thus busy developing new technologies and fixing holes in existing ones. The paper discusses wireless security technology and its shortcomings.","1558-0814","","10.1109/2.933495","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=933495","","Communication system security;Power system security;Information security;Personal digital assistants;Communications technology;Mobile communication;Data communication;Computer hacking;Cellular phones;Internet","wireless LAN;mobile computing;cellular radio;security of data;telecommunication security","mobile e-commerce transactions;email;corporate data transmissions;hacking;smart cellular phones;personal digital assistants;Internet;low bandwidth wireless networks;wireless security technology","","33","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

We exploit previous results to develop a new highly efficient super-resolution reconstruction algorithm for this case, which separates the treatment into de-blurring and measurements fusion.

Applications include the restoration of damaged photographs and movies and the removal of selected objects. We introduce a class of automated methods for digital inpainting. The approach uses ideas from classical fluid dynamics to propagate isophote lines continuously from the exterior into the region to be inpainted. The main idea is to think of the image intensity as a 'stream function for a two-dimensional incompressible flow. The Laplacian of the image intensity plays the role of the vorticity of the fluid; it is transported into the region to be inpainted by a vector field defined by the stream function. The resulting algorithm is designed to continue isophotes while matching gradient vectors at the boundary of the inpainting region. The method is directly based on the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid dynamics, which has the immediate advantage of well-developed theoretical and numerical results. This is a new approach for introducing ideas from computational fluid dynamics into problems in computer vision and image analysis.","1063-6919","0-7695-1272-0","10.1109/CVPR.2001.990497","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=990497","","Fluid dynamics;Streaming media;Filling;Image restoration;Motion pictures;Laplace equations;Algorithm design and analysis;Navier-Stokes equations;Computational fluid dynamics;Computer vision","image restoration;image matching;video signal processing;computational fluid dynamics","video inpainting;image inpainting;surrounding area;damaged photograph restoration;selected object removal;automated methods;digital inpainting;classical fluid dynamics;isophote line propagation;image intensity;stream function;two-dimensional incompressible flow;Laplacian;vector field;gradient vector matching;Navier-Stokes equations;computational fluid dynamics;computer vision;image analysis;missing data","","321","","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

From the results of computer simulations, we have found that these approaches are feasible for wireless optical communication systems utilizing white LED lights.","","0-7803-7244-1","10.1109/PIMRC.2001.965300","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=965300","","Light emitting diodes;LED lamps;Optical fiber communication;High speed optical techniques;Wireless communication;Optical mixing;OFDM;Stimulated emission;Optical communication equipment;Computer simulation","light emitting diodes;optical links;lighting;OFDM modulation;codes","indoor visible communication;plural white LED;light emitting diodes;indoor wireless optical communication;lighting;on-off keying return-to-zero coding;optical OFDM;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;OOK-RZ coding;optical path difference","","103","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Artificial consciousness: Utopia or real possibility?","G. Buttazzo","Pavia Univ., Italy","Computer","","2001","34","7","24","30","Since the beginnings of computer technology, researchers have speculated about the possibility of building smart machines that could compete with human intelligence. Given the current pace of advances in artificial intelligence and neural computing, such an evolution seems to be a more concrete possibility. Many people now believe that artificial consciousness is possible and that, in the future, it will emerge in complex computing machines. However, a discussion of artificial consciousness gives rise to several philosophical issues: can computers think or do they just calculate? Is consciousness a human prerogative? Does consciousness depend on the material that comprises the human brain, or can computer hardware replicate consciousness? Answering these questions is difficult because it requires combining information from many disciplines including computer science, neurophysiology, philosophy, and religion. Further, we must consider the influence of science fiction, especially science fiction films, when addressing artificial consciousness. As a product of the human imagination, such works express human desires and fears about future technologies and may influence the course of progress. At a societal level, science fiction simulates future scenarios that can help prepare us for crucial transitions by predicting the consequences of significant technological advances. The paper considers robots in science fiction, the Turing test, computer chess and artificial consciousness.","1558-0814","","10.1109/2.933500","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=933500","","Humans;Artificial intelligence;Intelligent structures;Machine intelligence;Concrete;Hardware;Computer science;Neurophysiology;Computational modeling;Predictive models","artificial intelligence;philosophical aspects;robots","artificial consciousness;smart machines;artificial intelligence;neural computing;philosophical issues;neurophysiology;religion;science fiction;robots;Turing test;computer chess","","20","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Constrained minimum power adaptive beamforming, which has been suggested by Frost (1972) and, in particular, the generalized sidelobe canceler (GSC) version, which has been developed by Griffiths and Jim (1982), are the most widely used beamforming techniques. These methods rely on the assumption that the received signals are simple delayed versions of the source signal. The good interference suppression attained under this assumption is severely impaired in complicated acoustic environments, where arbitrary TFs may be encountered. In this paper, we consider the arbitrary TF case. We propose a GSC solution, which is adapted to the general TF case. We derive a suboptimal algorithm that can be implemented by estimating the TFs ratios, instead of estimating the TFs. The TF ratios are estimated by exploiting the nonstationarity characteristics of the desired signal. The algorithm is applied to the problem of speech enhancement in a reverberating room.

Each customer chooses some constant d servers independently and uniformly at random from the n servers and waits for service at the one with the fewest customers. Customers are served according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) protocol and the service time for a customer is exponentially distributed with mean 1. We call this problem the supermarket model. We wish to know how the system behaves and in particular we are interested in the effect that the parameter d has on the expected time a customer spends in the system in equilibrium. Our approach uses a limiting, deterministic model representing the behavior as n/spl rarr//spl infin/ to approximate the behavior of finite systems. The analysis of the deterministic model is interesting in its own right. Along with a theoretical justification of this approach, we provide simulations that demonstrate that the method accurately predicts system behavior, even for relatively small systems. Our analysis provides surprising implications. Having d=2 choices leads to exponential improvements in the expected time a customer spends in the system over d=1, whereas having d=3 choices is only a constant factor better than d=2. We discuss the possible implications for system design.","1558-2183","","10.1109/71.963420","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=963420","","Load management;Queueing analysis;Protocols;Load modeling;Predictive models;System analysis and design;Computer applications;Resource management;H infinity control;Differential equations","resource allocation;queueing theory;exponential distribution;stochastic processes;distributed algorithms","randomized load balancing;Poisson stream;first-in first-out protocol;service time;exponential distribution;supermarket model;deterministic model;finite systems;simulations;queuing theory;distributed systems;limiting systems","","355","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We describe the nonlinear/non-Gaussian tracking problem and its optimal Bayesian solution. Since the optimal solution is intractable, several different approximation strategies are then described. These approaches include the extended Kalman filter and particle filters. For a particular problem, if the assumptions of the Kalman filter hold, then no other algorithm can out-perform it. However, in a variety of real scenarios, the assumptions do not hold and approximate techniques must be employed. The extended Kalman filter approximates the models used for the dynamics and measurement process, in order to be able to approximate the probability density by a Gaussian. Particle filtering approximates the density directly as a finite number of samples. A number of different types of particle filter exist and some have been shown to outperform others when used for particular applications. However, when designing a particle filter for a particular application, it is the choice of importance density that is critical. These notes are of a tutorial nature and so, to facilitate easy implementation, 'pseudo-code' for algorithms are included at relevant points.","","","10.1049/ic:20010246","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1031865","","","Kalman filters;target tracking;tracking filters;Bayes methods;state estimation;approximation theory;Gaussian distribution","particle filters;nonlinear Bayesian tracking;nonGaussian Bayesian tracking;Bayes methods;dynamic state estimation;approximation strategies;extended Kalman filter;probability density;Gaussian distribution;importance density;target tracking;tracking filters","","27","","","","","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Modulation and demodulation is achieved by using fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms. Mismatch in sampling frequencies between transmitter and receiver can lead to serious degradation due to the loss of orthogonality between the subcarriers. Therefore, the sampling frequency offset has to be estimated, and the error has to be compensated at the receiver side. In this paper, a novel sampling frequency offset estimation algorithm is proposed, which is based on the repetition of a symbol at the communication start-up. The estimate is calculated from the phase difference between successive symbols. Furthermore, a sampling frequency correction algorithm that does not require interpolation of signal samples is presented. Simulations were performed for both algorithms separately.

It is shown that this can be achieved without any external sensing provided that certain observability conditions are met. A theoretical analysis is provided together with a comparison of experimental results between a nonlinear implementation of the algorithm and an IMU/GPS navigation system. This comparison demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm. The real time implementation is also addressed through a multiple observation inertial aiding algorithm based on the information filter. The results show that the use of these constraints and vehicle speed guarantees the observability of the velocity and the attitude of the inertial unit, and hence bounds the errors associated with these states.

The mission of the UAV is low altitude navigation from an initial position to a final position in a partially known 3-D environment while avoiding obstacles and minimizing path length. We use a hierarchical approach to path planning. We distinguish between a global offline computation, based on a coarse known model of the environment and a local online computation, based on the information coming from the vision system.

The parameters under consideration are the motor armature-winding resistance and inductance, back e.m.f. constant, motor torque constant, moment of inertia, and the viscous friction. The dynamometer outputs are the discrete measurements of the armature current, angular velocity, armature voltage (system input), and the torque developed by the motor. In this paper parameter identification of a DC motor, employing the least-squares algorithm, is implemented without the use of a D/A converter and a power amplifier. In particular, the armature voltage is generated using a prime mover and a synchronous generator. The data acquisition system is composed of the existing dynamometer data acquisition coupled with special software resulting in collecting different measurements automatically at a desired fixed time interval. A Kalman filter is also implemented, as a state observer, to estimate the angular acceleration and the derivative of the armature current. In addition, to improve the overall identification performance, the DC parameters were first estimated by decoupling the AC parameters using a DC input signal. Subsequently, the estimated DC parameters are then used to identify the AC parameters.

"Contact resistance calculations: generalizations of Greenwood's formula including interface films","L. Boyer","Lab. de Genie Electr., Paris VI Univ., France","IEEE Transactions on Components and Packaging Technologies","","2001","24","1","50","58","The calculation of the contact resistance between two rough electrodes is a difficult task, since the contact interface comprises many spots corresponding to more or less conducting paths for the electrons. The present paper starts with an analytical formula derived by J.A. Greenwood (1966) to find the electrical resistance of a cluster of perfect circular microcontacts. It is first shown that Greenwood's formula can be used to derive known and new formulas for the constriction resistance of single spots of various shapes. Then we consider the case where the microcontacts are not perfect, and characterize each microcontact by a film resistance. To generalize Greenwood's formula, we use an intermediate expression derived by this author, and substitute for the constriction resistance term of each spot, a term comprising the constriction resistance and the film resistance. We then test the formulas proposed. In all situations the electrical contact area is modeled by means of a set of square spots. At first, we consider experimental results concerning long rectangular spots. Then, we consider numerical results concerning square ring-shaped spots. And lastly, we consider the ease where two large electrodes communicate through two concentric thin flat rings of variable conductivity. The contact resistance is then calculated using Greenwood's generalized formula and by means of the finite-element method. All tests are passed satisfactorily.","1557-9972","","10.1109/6144.910802","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910802","","Contact resistance;Electric resistance;Electrodes;Conductive films;Shape;Finite element methods;Testing;Conductivity;Electrons;Boundary element methods","contact resistance;finite element analysis;boundary-elements methods;electrical contacts;electrodes","contact resistance calculation;Greenwood's formula generalization;interface films;rough electrodes;perfect circular microcontacts;constriction resistance;single spots;film resistance;set of square spots;long rectangular spots;square ring-shaped spots;concentric thin flat rings;finite-element method;BEM","","27","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Illumination and geometrical invariant properties are derived from the reflectance model. Invariance and discriminative power of the color invariants is experimentally investigated, showing the invariants to be successful in discounting shadow, illumination, highlights, and noise. Extensive experiments show the different invariants to be highly discriminative, while maintaining invariance properties.

So far, there has not been much systematic research on ethical aspects in engineering design and on how engineers deal with such aspects. Engineering design is also an interesting topic to research from the point of view of engineering ethics because design is one of the main activities in which engineers are involved. Moreover, technology has social and ethical implications, mainly because of the kinds of products produced, which are the eventual outcomes of design processes. We focus on two ethical aspects of design processes: the formulation of design requirements and criteria, and the acceptance of tradeoffs between different design criteria. When calling an aspect of the design process ""ethical"", we have used the following criteria: the aspect of the design process is connected to, or brings about possible negative consequences, for people other than the designers involved; more or less generally accepted values or norms are at stake; and the norms and values of the different engineers involved in the design clash with each other.","1937-416X","","10.1109/44.952761","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=952761","","Design engineering;Process design;Ethics;Marine vehicles;Ethical aspects;Social implications of technology;Engineering education;Technology management;Engineering management;Safety","design engineering;professional aspects","engineering design processes;engineering ethics;education;research;social implications;design requirements;design criteria;tradeoffs;negative consequences;values;norms","","13","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

However, IGBT technology with high speed and greater packaging density leads to higher power densities on the chips and increases higher operating temperatures. These operating temperatures in turn lead to an increase of the failure rate and a reduction of the reliability. In this paper, the static and dynamic thermal behavior of IGBT module system mounted on a water-cooled heat sink is analyzed. Although three-dimensional finite element method (3-D FEM) delivers very accurate results, its usage is limited by an imposed computation time in arbitrary load cycles. Therefore, an RC component model (RCCM) is investigated to extract thermal resistances and time constants for a thermal network. The uniqueness of the RCCM is an introduction of the time constants based on the Elmore delay, which represents the propagation delay of the heat flux through the physical geometry of each layer. The dynamic behavior predicted by the thermal network is equivalent to numerical solutions of the 3-D FEM. The RCCM quickly offers insight into the physical layers of the components and provides useful information in a few minutes for the arbitrary or periodic power waveforms. This approach enables a system designer to couple the thermal prediction with a circuit simulator to analyze the electrothermal behavior of IGBT module system, simultaneously.","1557-9980","","10.1109/6040.938309","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=938309","","Electrothermal effects;Insulated gate bipolar transistors;Electronic packaging thermal management;Temperature;Thermal resistance;Propagation delay;Power system modeling;Power electronics;Voltage;Power system reliability","thermal analysis;insulated gate bipolar transistors;power semiconductor switches;semiconductor device packaging;failure analysis;semiconductor device reliability;heat sinks;thermal resistance","thermal component model;electrothermal analysis;IGBT module systems;power electronic systems;high voltage switching components;packaging density;power densities;operating temperatures;failure rate;reliability;water-cooled heat sink;computation time;RC component model;thermal resistances;time constants;Elmore delay;propagation delay;physical geometry;dynamic behavior;physical layers;periodic power waveforms;circuit simulator","","78","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This growth has placed excessive strain on the Internet infrastructure, especially on routers. The IP address lookup is the operation that searches the longest matching prefix for the destination address of an incoming packet in order to determine the next hop of the packet. This operation is complex and is a major bottleneck in high-performance routers. In this paper, we propose a fast and updatable lookup scheme that can be easily implemented in hardware.

Since our lookup scheme can be implemented with the small-bit logic and SRAM, the average delay per one lookup is about 18 ns.

In particular, characteristics such as frequency stop-bands, pass-bands and band-gaps could be identified. Surveying the literature, one observes that various terminology have been used depending on the domain of the applications.

"Protecting respondents identities in microdata release","P.

While in the past released information was mostly in tabular and statistical form, many situations call for the release of specific data (microdata). In order to protect the anonymity of the entities (called respondents) to which information refers, data holders often remove or encrypt explicit identifiers such as names, addresses, and phone numbers. Deidentifying data, however, provides no guarantee of anonymity. Released information often contains other data, such as race, birth date, sex, and ZIP code, that can be linked to publicly available information to reidentify respondents and inferring information that was not intended for disclosure. In this paper we address the problem of releasing microdata while safeguarding the anonymity of respondents to which the data refer. The approach is based on the definition of k-anonymity. A table provides k-anonymity if attempts to link explicitly identifying information to its content map the information to at least k entities. We illustrate how k-anonymity can be provided without compromising the integrity (or truthfulness) of the information released by using generalization and suppression techniques. We introduce the concept of minimal generalization that captures the property of the release process not distorting the data more than needed to achieve k-anonymity, and present an algorithm for the computation of such a generalization. We also discuss possible preference policies to choose among different minimal generalizations.","1558-2191","","10.1109/69.971193","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=971193","","Protection;Demography;Databases;Joining processes;Statistics;Vehicles;Licenses;Intelligent networks;Computer Society;Cryptography","data privacy;security of data","respondent identity protection;microdata release;k-anonymity;suppression techniques;generalization techniques;preference policies","","1078","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We introduce an algorithm for the blind estimation of symbol timing and carrier frequency offset in wireless OFDM systems. The proposed estimator is an extension of the Gini-Giannakis (see IEEE Trans. Commun., vol.46, p.400-411, 1998) estimator for single-carrier systems. It exploits the cyclostationarity of OFDM signals and relies on second-order statistics only. Our method can be applied to pulse shaping OFDM systems with arbitrary time-frequency guard regions, OFDM based on offset quadrature amplitude modulation, and biorthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems. We furthermore propose the use of different subcarrier transmit powers (subcarrier weighting) and periodic transmitter precoding to achieve a carrier frequency acquisition range of the entire bandwidth of the OFDM signal, and a symbol timing acquisition range of arbitrary length. Finally, we provide simulation results demonstrating the performance of the new estimator.","1558-0857","","10.1109/26.930629","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=930629","","Frequency estimation;Timing;OFDM;Frequency division multiplexing;Frequency synchronization;Wireless sensor networks;Statistics;Pulse shaping methods;Time frequency analysis;Quadrature amplitude modulation","OFDM modulation;frequency estimation;timing;quadrature amplitude modulation;pulse shaping;statistical analysis;radio transmitters;land mobile radio;radio links","blind estimation;symbol timing estimation;carrier frequency offset estimation;wireless OFDM systems;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;synchronization errors;algorithm;Gini-Giannakis estimator;cyclostationary OFDM signals;second-order statistics;time-frequency guard regions;offset quadrature amplitude modulation;biorthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;subcarrier transmit power;subcarrier weighting;periodic transmitter precoding;carrier frequency acquisition range;bandwidth;symbol timing acquisition range;simulation results;estimator performance;mobile radio systems;downlink;pulse shaping OFDM/QAM;OFDM/OQAM","","261","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper describes a new type of BCI system that uses rapid prototyping to enable a fast transition of various types of parameter estimation and classification algorithms to real-time implementation and testing. Rapid prototyping is possible by using Matlab, Simulink, and the Real-Time Workshop. It is shown how to automate real-time experiments and perform the interplay between on-line experiments and offline analysis. The system is able to process multiple EEG channels on-line and operates under Windows 95 in real-time on a standard PC without an additional DSP board. The BCI can be controlled over the Internet, LAN or modem. This BCI was tested on 3 subjects whose task it was to imagine either left or right hand movement.

The hyper-parameters of the model are inferred on the second level of inference. The inferred hyper-parameters, related to the volatility, are used to construct a volatility model within the evidence framework. Model comparison is performed on the third level of inference in order to automatically tune the parameters of the kernel function and to select the relevant inputs. The LS-SVM formulation allows one to derive analytic expressions in the feature space and practical expressions are obtained in the dual space replacing the inner product by the related kernel function using Mercer's theorem.

When approached as a pattern recognition problem, the success of a myoelectric control scheme depends largely on the classification accuracy. A novel approach is described that demonstrates greater accuracy than in previous work. Fundamental to the success of this method is the use of a wavelet-based feature set, reduced in dimension by principal components analysis. Further, it is shown that four channels of myoelectric data greatly improve the classification accuracy, as compared to one or two channels. It is demonstrated that exceptionally accurate performance is possible using the steady-state myoelectric signal. Exploiting these successes, a robust online classifier is constructed, which produces class decisions on a continuous stream of data. Although in its preliminary stages of development, this scheme promises a more natural and efficient means of myoelectric control than one based on discrete, transient bursts of activity.","1558-2531","","10.1109/10.914793","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=914793","","Continuous wavelet transforms;Control systems;Pattern recognition;Wavelet analysis;Biomedical engineering;Motion control;Principal component analysis;Steady-state;Prosthetics;Wavelet packets","wavelet transforms;electromyography;biocontrol;artificial limbs;principal component analysis;pattern recognition;medical signal processing","multifunction myoelectric control;wavelet-based continuous classification scheme;dexterous natural control;powered upper limbs;pattern recognition problem;classification accuracy;wavelet-based feature set;robust online classifier;discrete transient activity bursts;continuous data stream;EMG","Algorithms;Arm;Artificial Limbs;Electrocardiography;Feasibility Studies;Hand;Humans;Movement;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Prosthesis Design;Reference Values;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Wrist","411","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Some, such as location, deployment, and tracking, are fundamental issues, in that many applications rely on them for needed information. We address one of the fundamental problems, namely coverage. Coverage in general, answers the questions about quality of service (surveillance) that can be provided by a particular sensor network. We first define the coverage problem from several points of view including deterministic, statistical, worst and best case, and present examples in each domain. By combining the computational geometry and graph theoretic techniques, specifically the Voronoi diagram and graph search algorithms, we establish the main highlight of the paper-optimal polynomial time worst and average case algorithm for coverage calculation.

Both singleand double-wire structures have been considered, the latter under the assumption of parallel wires. Two electrical models of the bonding wire are discussed. First, the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is proposed for the rigorous analysis of such structures. This method uses a suitable discretization technique, which accounts for the wire curvature by means of a polygonal approximation. A quasi-static model of the bonding wire, suitable for commercial microwave computer-aided-design tools is then proposed. This model is based on the representation of the structure with four sections of a uniform transmission line and the model parameters are evaluated analytically from the dimensions of the interconnection. Accuracy and applicability of the quasi-static model have been assessed by analyzing several test structures, the reference results being obtained with the FDTD method. Finally, the quasi-static model has been used to provide an extensive electrical characterization of the bonding wire versus its main geometrical parameters. This characterization is given in terms of an equivalent series inductance and two equivalent shunt capacitances forming a /spl pi/ low-pass network. This representation is particularly useful in the matching of the bonding-wire discontinuity.","1557-9670","","10.1109/22.899975","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=899975","","Bonding;Wire;Finite difference methods;Integrated circuit interconnections;Time domain analysis;MMICs;Microwave integrated circuits;Transmission lines;Inductance;Microwave devices","lead bonding;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit packaging;modelling;finite difference time-domain analysis;circuit CAD;MMIC;MIMIC","interconnection modeling;electrical characterization;bonding-wire interconnection;single-wire structures;double-wire structures;parallel wires;electrical models;finite-difference time-domain method;FDTD method;discretization technique;wire curvature;polygonal approximation;quasi-static model;commercial microwave CAD tools;microwave computer-aided-design tools;uniform transmission line;model parameters evaluation;geometrical parameters;equivalent series inductance;equivalent shunt capacitances;/spl pi/ low-pass network;bonding-wire discontinuity matching;MMIC;MIC;MCM;MIMIC","","84","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, it is now clear that not all three phase induction motors are capable of generating such harmonics in the line current. Recent research has shown that the presence of these harmonics is primarily dependent on the number of rotor slots and the number of fundamental pole pairs of the machine. While the number of fundamental pole pairs of a three phase induction motor usually is within one to four (higher pole pairs are generally avoided due to increased magnetizing current), the number of rotor slots can vary widely. The present paper investigates this phenomenon further and obtains a hitherto nebulous theoretical basis for the experimentally verified results. Detailed coupled magnetic circuit simulation results are presented for a four pole, three phase induction motor with 44, 43, and 42 rotor slots under healthy, static, dynamic and mixed eccentricity conditions. The simulation is flexible enough to accommodate other pole numbers also. These simulations are helpful in quantifying the predicted harmonics under different combinations of load, pole pair numbers, rotor slots and eccentricity conditions, thus making the problem easier for drive designers or diagnostic tools' developers. Data from three different induction machines, namely, a 4 pole, 44 bar, 3 hp, a 4 pole, 28 bar, 3 hp and a 2 pole, 39 bar, 100 hp motor have been used to verify the results experimentally. The simulation and the experimental results clearly validate the theoretical findings put forward in this paper.","1558-0059","","10.1109/60.937205","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=937205","","Rotors;Induction motors;Circuit simulation;Fault detection;Phase detection;Phase estimation;Induction generators;Coupling circuits;Magnetic circuits;Predictive models","squirrel cage motors;rotors;harmonics;machine theory;fault diagnosis;machine testing;magnetic circuits","rotor slot harmonics detection;eccentricity-related harmonics detection;three-phase induction motor;rotor cages;sensorless speed estimation;eccentricity related fault detection;fundamental pole pairs;coupled magnetic circuit simulation;pole pair numbers;load;3 hp;100 hp","","249","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With SILK, designers can quickly sketch an interface using an electronic pad and stylus, and SILK recognizes widgets and other interface elements as the designer draws them. Unlike paper-based sketching, however, designers can exercise these elements in their sketchy state. For example, a sketched scroll-bar is likely to contain an elevator or thumbnail, the small rectangle a user drags with a mouse. In a paper sketch, the elevator would just sit there, but in a SILK sketch, designers can drag it up and down, which lets them test component or widget behavior. SILK also supports the creation of storyboards-the arrangement of sketches to show how design elements behave, such as how a dialog box appears when the user activates a button. Storyboards are important because they give designers a way to show colleagues, customers, or end users early on how an interface will behave.","1558-0814","","10.1109/2.910894","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910894","","Humans;Testing;Mice;Computer interfaces;Elevators;Prototypes;Text recognition;Writing;Usability;Liquid crystal displays","user interfaces","SILK;Sketching Interfaces Like Krazy;informal sketching tool;electronic pad and stylus;widgets;interface elements;storyboards","","189","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Once established, these positions are propagated to more distant nodes, allowing the entire network to create an accurate map of itself. Major obstacles include overcoming inaccuracies in range measurements as great as /spl plusmn/50%, as well as the development of initial guesses for node locations in clusters with few or no anchor nodes.

Virtual leaders can be used to manipulate group geometry and direct the motion of the group. The approach provides a construction for a Lyapunov function to prove closed-loop stability using the system kinetic energy and the artificial potential energy.

Patt","Texas Univ., Austin, TX, USA","Proceedings of the IEEE","","2001","89","11","1553","1559","The first microprocessor the Intel 4004, showed up in 1971. It contained 2300 transistors and operated at a clockfrequency of 108 kHz. Today, 30 years later the microprocessor contains almost 200 million transistors, operating at a frequency of more than 1 GHz. In five years, those numbers are expected to grow to more than a billion transistors on a single chip, operating at a clockfrequency of from 6 to 10 GHz. The evolution of the microprocessor from where it started in 1971 to where it is today and where it is likely to be in five years, has come about because of several contributing forces. Our position is that this evolution did not just happen, that each step forward came as a result of one of three things, and always within the context of a computer architect making tradeoffs. The three things are: 1) new requirements; 2) bottlenecks; and 3) good fortune. I call them collectively agents for evolution. This article attempts to do three things: describe a basic framework for the field of microprocessors, show some of the important developments that have come along in the 30 years since the arrival of the first microprocessor and finally, suggest some of the new things you can expect to see in a high-performance microprocessor in the next five years.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.964437","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=964437","","Microprocessors;Natural languages;Electrons;Instruction sets;Clocks;Computer architecture;Hardware;Consumer electronics;Hip;Read only memory","microprocessor chips","microprocessor;computer architecture;microarchitecture;microprocessor design;microprocessor evolution","","14","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Eng., Heriot-Watt Univ., Edinburgh, UK; NA; NA","IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","","2001","26","2","240","251","This paper describes a new framework for segmentation of sonar images, tracking of underwater objects and motion estimation. This framework is applied to the design of an obstacle avoidance and path planning system for underwater vehicles based on a multi-beam forward looking sonar sensor. The real-time data flow (acoustic images) at the input of the system is first segmented and relevant features are extracted. We also take advantage of the real-time data stream to track the obstacles in following frames to obtain their dynamic characteristics. This allows us to optimize the preprocessing phases in segmenting only the relevant part of the images. Once the static (size and shape) as well as dynamic characteristics (velocity, acceleration,...) of the obstacles have been computed, we create a representation of the vehicle's workspace based on these features. This representation uses constructive solid geometry (CSG) to create a convex set of obstacles defining the workspace. The tracking takes also into account obstacles which are no longer in the field of view of the sonar in the path planning phase. A well-proven nonlinear search (sequential quadratic programming) is then employed, where obstacles are expressed as constraints in the search space. This approach is less affected by local minima than classical methods using potential fields. The proposed system is not only capable of obstacle avoidance but also of path planning in complex environments which include fast moving obstacles. Results obtained on real sonar data are shown and discussed. Possible applications to sonar servoing and real-time motion estimation are also discussed.","1558-1691","","10.1109/48.922790","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=922790","","Underwater vehicles;Path planning;Image segmentation;Underwater tracking;Motion estimation;Sonar applications;Vehicle dynamics;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems;Acoustic sensors","underwater vehicles;remotely operated vehicles;path planning;collision avoidance;motion estimation;quadratic programming;sonar imaging;sonar tracking;image segmentation;feature extraction;Kalman filters;covariance matrices;search problems","underwater vehicle;obstacle avoidance;path planning;multibeam forward looking sonar;sonar images segmentation;underwater object tracking;motion estimation;real-time data flow;feature extraction;dynamic characteristics;static characteristics;workspace representation;constructive solid geometry;convex set of obstacles;nonlinear search;sequential quadratic programming;fast moving obstacles;sonar servoing;underwater robotics;Kalman filters;covariance matrix","","127","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Knowledge of the spatial distribution of wireless callers will facilitate the planning, design, and operation of next generation broadband wireless networks. Mobile users will gain the ability to get local traffic information and detailed directions to gas stations, restaurants, hotels, and other services. Police and rescue teams will be able to quickly and precisely locate people who are lost or injured but cannot give their precise location. Companies will use geolocation based applications to track personnel, vehicles, and other assets. The driving force behind the development of this technology is a US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) mandate stating that by 1 October 2001 all wireless carriers must provide the geolocation of an emergency 911 caller to the appropriate public safety answering point. Location technologies requiring new modified, or upgraded mobile stations must determine the caller's longitude and latitude within 50 meters for 67 percent of emergency calls, and within 150 meters for 95 percent of the calls. Otherwise, they must do so within 100 meters and 300 meters, respectively, for the same percentage of calls. Currently deployed wireless technology can locate 911 calls within an area no smaller than 10 to 15 square kilometers.

Power-supply noise is often the most common and dominant source of jitter on a phase-locked loop's (PLL) output clock. Jitter can be minimized by regulating the supply to the PLL's noise-sensitive analog circuit blocks in order to filter out supply noise. This paper introduces a PLL-based clock generator intended for use in a high-speed highly integrated system-on-a-chip design. The generator produces clocks with accurate duty cycles and phase relationships by means of a high-speed divider design. The PLL also achieves a power-supply rejection ratio (PSRR) greater than 40 dB while operating at frequencies exceeding 4 GHz. The high level of noise rejection exceeds that of earlier designs by using a combination of both passive and active filtering of the PLL's analog supply voltage. The PLL system has been integrated in a 0.15-/spl mu/m single-poly 5-metal digital CMOS technology. The measured performance indicates that at a 4-GHz output frequency the circuit achieves a PSRR greater than 40 dB. The peak cycle-to-cycle jitter is 25 ps at 700 MHz and a 2.8-GHz VCO frequency with a 500-mV step on the regulator's 3.3-V supply.

The power control principles of VSI are described. Various system configurations and switching strategies are examined by analysis, simulation and experimental methods. It is shown that better utilisation of semiconductors and more flexible control may be achieved by using a separately controlled DC link, rather than a directly connected VSI that has to operate at a lower modulation ratio at higher power. In some cases, multipulse inverter structures may be preferred, despite higher component count, because of reduced switching losses, fault tolerance and the absence of filters.

Our rigorous analysis based on martingales, our methodology for constructing good irregular codes, and the demonstration that irregular structure improves performance constitute key points of our contribution. We also consider irregular codes under belief propagation. We report the results of experiments testing the efficacy of irregular codes on both binary-symmetric and Gaussian channels. For example, using belief propagation, for rate 1/4 codes on 16000 bits over a binary-symmetric channel, previous low-density parity-check codes can correct up to approximately 16% errors, while our codes correct over 17%. In some cases our results come very close to reported results for turbo codes, suggesting that variations of irregular low density parity-check codes may be able to match or beat turbo code performance.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.910576","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910576","","Error correction coding","error correction codes;graph theory;decoding;Gaussian channels","low-density parity-check codes;irregular graphs;irregular parity-check matrices;hard-decision decoding;irregular structures;decoding algorithms;martingales;irregular codes;performance;belief propagation;binary-symmetric channels;Gaussian channels;code rate;turbo code performance;error correction codes","","432","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Genomic signal processing","D. Anastassiou","NA","IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","","2001","18","4","8","20","Genomics is a highly cross-disciplinary field that creates paradigm shifts in such diverse areas as medicine and agriculture. It is believed that many significant scientific and technological endeavors in the 21st century will be related to the processing and interpretation of the vast information that is currently revealed from sequencing the genomes of many living organisms, including humans. Genomic information is digital in a very real sense; it is represented in the form of sequences of which each element can be one out of a finite number of entities. Such sequences, like DNA and proteins, have been mathematically represented by character strings, in which each character is a letter of an alphabet. In the case of DNA, the alphabet is size 4 and consists of the letters A, T, C and G; in the case of proteins, the size of the corresponding alphabet is 20. As the list of references shows, biomolecular sequence analysis has already been a major research topic among computer scientists, physicists, and mathematicians. The main reason that the field of signal processing does not yet have significant impact in the field is because it deals with numerical sequences rather than character strings. However, if we properly map a character string into, one or more numerical sequences, then digital signal processing (DSP) provides a set of novel and useful tools for solving highly relevant problems. For example, in the form of local texture, color spectrograms visually provide significant information about biomolecular sequences which facilitates understanding of local nature, structure, and function. Furthermore, both the magnitude and the phase of properly defined Fourier transforms can be used to predict important features like the location and certain properties of protein coding regions in DNA. Even the process of mapping DNA into proteins and the interdependence of the two kinds of sequences can be analyzed using simulations based on digital filtering. These and other DSP-based approaches result in alternative mathematical formulations and may provide improved computational techniques for the solution of useful problems in genomic information science and technology.","1558-0792","","10.1109/79.939833","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=939833","","Genomics;Bioinformatics;Signal processing;Sequences;DNA;Proteins;Biomedical signal processing;Digital signal processing;Agriculture;Organisms","medical signal processing;sequences;proteins;Fourier transforms;DNA;molecular biophysics;digital simulation;digital filters","genomic signal processing;medicine;agriculture;genomes sequences;living organisms;DNA;proteins;character strings;alphabet size;biomolecular sequence analysis;numerical sequences;digital signal processing;DSP;local texture;color spectrograms;biomolecular sequences;phase magnitude;Fourier transforms;protein coding regions;simulations;digital filtering;genomic information science;genomic information technology","","247","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

On-demand routing in particular, is widely developed in bandwidth constrained mobile wireless ad hoc networks because of its effectiveness and efficiency. Most proposed on-demand routing protocols however, build and rely on a single route for each data session. Whenever there is a link disconnection on the active route, the routing protocol must perform a route recovery process. In QoS routing for wired networks, multiple path routing is popularly used. Multiple routes are however, constructed using link-state or distance vector algorithms which are not well-suited for ad hoc networks. We propose an on-demand routing scheme called split multipath routing (SMR) that establishes and utilizes multiple routes of maximally disjoint paths. Providing multiple routes helps minimizing route recovery process and control message overhead. Our protocol uses a per-packet allocation scheme to distribute data packets into multiple paths of active sessions. This traffic distribution efficiently utilizes available network resources and prevents nodes of the route from being congested in heavily loaded traffic situations. We evaluate the performance of our scheme using extensive simulation.","","0-7803-7097-1","10.1109/ICC.2001.937262","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=937262","","Intelligent networks;Ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Mobile communication;Telecommunication traffic;Bandwidth;Communication system traffic control;Traffic control;Packet radio networks;Wireless networks","mobile radio;packet radio networks;telecommunication network routing;protocols;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication traffic","split multipath routing;maximally disjoint paths;mobile wireless ad hoc networks;on-demand routing;routing protocols;QoS routing;distance vector algorithms;link-state algorithms;multiple routes;route recovery process;control message overhead;per-packet allocation scheme;data packets;traffic distribution","","561","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We then invert the process to enable the removal of haze from images. The method can be used with as few as two images taken through a polarizer at different orientations. This method works instantly, without relying on changes of weather conditions. We present experimental results of complete dehazing in far from ideal conditions for polarization filtering.

All packets belonging to the same flow obey a predefined rule and are processed in a similar manner by the router. For example, all packets with the same source and destination IP addresses may be defined to form a flow. Packet classification is needed for non-best-effort services, such as firewalls and quality of service; services that require the capability to distinguish and isolate traffic in different flows for suitable processing. In general, packet classification on multiple fields is a difficult problem. Hence, researchers have proposed a variety of algorithms which, broadly speaking, can be categorized as basic search algorithms, geometric algorithms, heuristic algorithms, or hardware-specific search algorithms.

Voltage sags accompanied by a phase jump are in some cases more likely to trip loads and a satisfactory voltage compensation are more difficult to achieve. Different control methods to compensate voltage sags with phase jump are proposed and compared. Two promising control methods are tested with simulations carried out in Saber and finally tested on a 10 kVA rated dynamic voltage restorer in the laboratory. Both methods can be used to reduce load voltage disturbances caused by voltage sags with phase jump. One method completely compensates the phase jump, which is the best solution for very sensitive loads.

"TCP in a wireless world","G.

One approach to supporting the wireless environment is the so-called ""walled garden"". Here the transport protocol used within the mobile wireless environment is not TCP, but is instead a transport protocol that has been specifically adapted to mobile wireless. In this model, Internet applications interact with an application gateway to reach the wireless world, and the application gateway uses a wireless transport protocol and potentially a modified version of the application data to interact with the wireless device. The most common implementation of this approach is to extend a Web client into the mobile wireless device, using some form of proxy server at the boundary of the wireless network and the Internet. This is the approach adopted by the Wireless Access Protocol (WAP) Forum. An alternative is to allow mobile wireless devices to function as any other Internet-connected device. This approach requires some form of end-to-end direct IP continuity and an associated end-to-end TCP functionality, where the TCP path straddles both wired and wireless segments. Ensuring the efficient operation of TCP in this environment becomes integral to the development of the environment itself; the problem is no longer one of adjusting TCP to match the requirements of the wireless environment, but one of providing seamless interworking between the wired and wireless worlds.","1941-0131","","10.1109/4236.914651","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=914651","","Delay;Automatic repeat request;Internet;TCPIP;Bit error rate;Transport protocols;Bandwidth;Forward error correction;Performance loss;Wireless application protocol","mobile computing;Internet;transport protocols;wireless LAN","TCP;wireless world;Internet applications;Internet protocols;application gateway;walled garden;mobile wireless environment;wireless transport protocol;application data;wireless device;Web client;mobile wireless device;proxy server;Internet;Wireless Access Protocol;WAP;mobile wireless devices;Internet-connected device;end-to-end direct IP continuity;end-to-end TCP functionality;seamless interworking","","24","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In the proposed method, the frequency domain data windowing is used to reduce the aliasing errors for the interpolation case and get better noise filtering performance for the noninterpolation case. The time domain MMSE weighting is also used to suppress the channel noise for both cases. Moreover, the optimal generalized Hanning window shape is searched to minimize the channel estimation mean square error (MSE). Analysis and simulation results show that the proposed method performance is close to the optimal MMSE estimator and is much better than the direct DFT-based estimator for both cases. Compared with the optimal MMSE estimator, however, the computation load of the proposed method can be significantly reduced because the IDFT/DFT transforms can be implemented with the fast algorithms IFFT/FFT.","1558-0857","","10.1109/26.966074","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=966074","","Discrete Fourier transforms;Mean square error methods;Interpolation;Multi-stage noise shaping;Frequency estimation;Frequency division multiplexing;OFDM;Mobile communication;Frequency domain analysis;Noise reduction","OFDM modulation;interpolation;discrete Fourier transforms;computational complexity;least mean squares methods;parameter estimation;land mobile radio;multipath channels;Rayleigh channels","low-complexity channel estimator;windowed DFT-based MMSE channel estimator;OFDM systems;discrete Fourier transform;minimum mean square error;interpolation;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;mobile communications systems;frequency domain data windowing;aliasing errors reduction;noise filtering performance;noninterpolation case;time domain MMSE weighting;channel noise suppression;optimal generalized Hanning window shape;simulation results;optimal MMSE estimator;DFT-based estimator;computation load reduction;IDFT/DFT transforms;fast algorithms;IFFT/FFT;multipath fading channels;Rayleigh fading","","120","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Improvements in lithography are responsible for roughly half of the improvement in cost per function in integrated circuit (IC) technology. The underlying reason for the driving force in semiconductor technology has been the ability to keep the cost for printing a silicon wafer roughly constant while dramatically increasing the number of transistors that can be printed per chip. ICs have always been printed optically with improvements in lens and imaging material technology along with decreases in wavelength used fueling the steady improvement of lithography technology. The end of optical lithography technology has been predicted by many and for many years. Many technologies have been proposed and developed to improve on the performance of optical lithography, but so far none has succeeded. This has been true largely because it has always been more economical to push incremental improvements in the existing optical technology rather than displace it with a new one. At some point in time, the costs for pushing optical lithography technology beyond previously conceived limits may exceed the cost of introducing new technologies. In this paper the author examines the limits of lithography and possible future technologies from both a technical and economic point of view.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.915379","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=915379","","Lithography;Integrated circuit technology;Economic forecasting;Fuel economy;Driver circuits;Electronics industry;Cost function;Printing;Silicon;Lenses","lithography;integrated circuit manufacture;integrated circuit technology;nanotechnology","lithography technology limitations;integrated circuit technology;IC technology;semiconductor technology;Si wafer;optical lithography;ownership costs;EUV lithography;UV lithography;electron projection lithography;direct write E-beam lithography;economics","","114","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a result, the amplifier design problem can be expressed as a special form of optimization problem called geometric programming, for which very efficient global optimization methods have been developed. As a consequence we can efficiently determine globally optimal amplifier designs or globally optimal tradeoffs among competing performance measures such as power, open-loop gain, and bandwidth. Our method, therefore, yields completely automated sizing of (globally) optimal CMOS amplifiers, directly from specifications. In this paper, we apply this method to a specific widely used operational amplifier architecture, showing in detail how to formulate the design problem as a geometric program.

Both legs are controlled by the impedance control, where the desired impedance at the hip and the swing foot are specified. The impedance parameters are changed depending on the gait phase of the biped robot. To reduce the magnitude of impact and to guarantee a stable footing at foot landings on the ground, the damping coefficient of the impedance of the landing foot is increased drastically and the reference trajectory of the landing foot is reset at its initial contact with the ground. A series of computer simulations of a 12-degree-of-freedom (DOF) biped robot with a 6-DOF environment model which consists of nonlinear and linear compliant spring-and-dampers, shows that the proposed control method works well and is superior to position-oriented control methods such as the computed-torque control method in impact regulation during foot landings and adaptation to some ground irregularity.","2374-958X","","10.1109/70.976014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=976014","","Robot control;Foot;Legged locomotion;Stability;Humans;Leg;Hip;Surface impedance;Damping;Computer simulation","legged locomotion;stability","biped robot locomotion;impedance control;impedance modulation;biped robot;stable footing;damping coefficient","","139","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Obtaining such an estimate is a central part of solving the color constancy problem. Thus, the work presented will have applications in fields such as color-based object recognition and digital photography. Rather than attempting to recover a single estimate of the illuminant, we instead set out to recover a measure of the likelihood that each of a set of possible illuminants was the scene illuminant. We begin by determining which image colors can occur (and how these colors are distributed) under each of a set of possible lights. We discuss how, for a given camera, we can obtain this knowledge. We then correlate this information with the colors in a particular image to obtain a measure of the likelihood that each of the possible lights was the scene illuminant. Finally, we use this likelihood information to choose a single light as an estimate of the scene illuminant. Computation is expressed and performed in a generic correlation framework which we develop. We propose a new probabilistic instantiation of this correlation framework and show that it delivers very good color constancy on both synthetic and real images. We further show that the proposed framework is rich enough to allow many existing algorithms to be expressed within it: the gray-world and gamut-mapping algorithms are presented in this framework and we also explore the relationship of these algorithms to other probabilistic and neural network approaches to color constancy.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.969113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=969113","","Layout;Lighting;Object recognition;Digital photography;Cameras;Reflectivity;Particle measurements;Neural networks;Shape;Light sources","image colour analysis;lighting;image restoration;maximum likelihood estimation;correlation theory","color by correlation;unifying framework;illuminant estimation;color constancy problem;illuminant independent representation;reflectances;color-based object recognition;digital photography;scene illuminant;likelihood measure;likelihood information;single light;generic correlation framework;probabilistic instantiation;gray-world;gamut-mapping algorithms;neural network approaches;probabilistic approaches;correlation matrix","","360","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However system designers still must design thermal heat sinks to withstand the worse-case scenario. We define and investigate the major components of any dynamic thermal management scheme.

"Novel soft-switching DC-DC converter with full ZVS-range and reduced filter requirement. I. Regulated-output applications","R. Ayyanar; N. Mohan","Dept. of Electr. Eng., Arizona Univ., Tempe, AZ, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","","2001","16","2","184","192","A novel soft-switching topology for DC-DC converters is proposed. It is well suited for applications in the range of a few hundred watts to a few kilowatts. It is essentially a hybrid combination of an uncontrolled half-bridge section and a phase-shift controlled full-bridge section, realized with just four switches. The main features of the proposed topology are zero-voltage-switching down to no-load without serious conduction loss penalty, constant frequency operation and, near-ideal filter waveforms. The improved filter waveforms result in significant savings in the input and output filter requirement, resulting in high power-density. The new topology requires two transformers and two DC-bypass capacitors. The combined VA rating of the two transformers is more than that of the single transformer of conventional full-bridge converters, for variable-input applications. In Part I of the paper, the converter operation is analyzed for typical switch-mode power supply applications, where the input voltage varies widely but the output voltage is fixed and is well regulated. Experimental results obtained from a 100 W/200 kHz proof-of-concept prototype confirm the superior features of the proposed hybrid configuration.","1941-0107","","10.1109/63.911142","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=911142","","DC-DC power converters;Topology;Filters;Transformers;Switches;Frequency;Capacitors;Switching converters;Power supplies;Prototypes","DC-DC power convertors;transformers;capacitors;bridge circuits;switched mode power supplies;switching circuits;phase control","soft-switching DC-DC converter;full ZVS-range;reduced filter requirement;regulated-output applications;soft-switching topology;uncontrolled half-bridge section;phase-shift controlled full-bridge section;zero-voltage-switching;near-ideal filter waveforms;constant frequency operation;high power-density;transformers;DC-bypass capacitors;switch-mode power supply;input voltage variation;100 W;200 kHz","","129","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Design, analysis, and performance evaluation for BICM-ID with square QAM constellations in Rayleigh fading channels","A. Chindapol; J. A. Ritcey","Dept. of Electr.

We propose the design criteria that utilize a large Hamming distance inherited in a low-rate code and a new labeling technique designed specifically for fading channels. This results in a large coding gain over noniterative coded modulation and performance close to that of ""turbo"" coded modulation with less complexity. We also show that BICM-ID designed for fading channels usually has a very good performance over the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel while the converse is difficult to achieve. When combined with signal space diversity, diversity order can be improved to twice the diversity order of conventional BICM-ID; therefore, the code complexity can further be reduced while maintaining the same level of performance. Specifically, with the bandwidth efficiency of 2 bits/s/Hz over Rayleigh fading channels, a bit error rate (BER) of 10/sup -6/ can be achieved with 16-QAM, a four-state rate 1/2 code at E/sub b//N/sub 0/ of about seven dB.

This approach also enables the control of stereo disparity, giving larger baselines for faraway scenes, and a smaller baseline for closer scenes. Capturing panoramic omnistereo images with a rotating camera makes it impossible to capture dynamic scenes at video rates and limits omnistereo imaging to stationary scenes. We present two possibilities for capturing omnistereo panoramas using optics without any moving parts. A special mirror is introduced such that viewing the scene through this mirror creates the same rays as those used with the rotating cameras. The lens used for omnistereo panorama is also introduced, together with the design of the mirror.

No.01CH37148)","","2001","3","","2301","2308 vol.3","This paper describes a receding-horizon optimal control scheme for autonomous trajectory generation and flight control of an unmanned air vehicle in urban terrain. In such environments, the mission objective or terrain may be dynamic, and the vehicle may change dynamics mid-flight due to sensor or actuator failure; thus off-line pre-planned flight trajectories axe limiting and insufficient. This technology is aimed at supporting guidance and control for future missions that will require vehicles with increased autonomy in dangerous situations and with tight maneuvering and operational capability e.g., missions in urban environments. A Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme is described here that navigates a vehicle with nonlinear dynamics through a vector of known way-points to a goal, and manages constraints. In this MPC-based approach to trajectory planning with constraints, a feedforward nominal trajectory is used to convert the nonconvex, nonlinear optimal control problem into a time-varying linear, convex optimization or quadratic programming problem. The nonconvex, admissible path space is converted to a sequence of overlapping, convex spaces. The feedforward control that produces the nominal trajectory is found from the vehicle's differentially flat outputs. MPC is used to determine the optimal perturbations to the nominal control that will suitably navigate the vehicle through a constrained input/output space while minimizing actuation effort. Simulation results with a non-real-time, online MPC controller for a UAV in a planar urban terrain are included to support the proposed approach.","0743-1619","0-7803-6495-3","10.1109/ACC.2001.946095","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=946095","","Unmanned aerial vehicles;Optimal control;Vehicle dynamics;Navigation;Trajectory;Aerospace control;Remotely operated vehicles;Actuators;Predictive models;Predictive control","optimal control;predictive control;time-varying systems;linear systems;convex programming;quadratic programming","trajectory generation;UAV;urban terrain;receding-horizon optimal control;autonomous trajectory generation;flight control;unmanned air vehicle;sensor failure;actuator failure;flight trajectories;operational capability;feedforward nominal trajectory;time-varying linear system;convex optimization;quadratic programming;admissible path space;constrained input/output space;nonlinear model predictive control","","58","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We show that the classical gated nearest neighbor approach, which considers each matching between sensor observations and features independently, ignores the fact that measurement prediction errors are correlated. This leads to easily accepting incorrect matchings when clutter or vehicle errors increase.

This reveals the critical need of having a sophisticated switching scheme and an adaptive weighted median filter. We propose a novel switching-based median filter with incorporation of fuzzy-set concept, called the noise adaptive soft-switching median (NASM) filter, to achieve much improved filtering performance in terms of effectiveness in removing impulse noise while preserving signal details and robustness in combating noise density variations. The proposed NASM filter consists of two stages. A soft-switching noise-detection scheme is developed to classify each pixel to be uncorrupted pixel, isolated impulse noise, nonisolated impulse noise or image object's edge pixel. ""No filtering"" (or identity filter), standard median (SM) filter or our developed fuzzy weighted median (FWM) filter will then be employed according to the respective characteristic type identified. Experimental results show that our NASM filter impressively outperforms other techniques by achieving fairly close performance to that of ideal-switching median filter across a wide range of noise densities, ranging from 10% to 70%.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.902289","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=902289","","Adaptive filters;Filtering;Samarium;Pixel;Noise level;Degradation;Interference;Noise robustness;Standards development;Image enhancement","impulse noise;adaptive filters;adaptive signal processing;filtering theory;median filters;switching circuits;fuzzy set theory;image classification;adaptive signal detection","noise adaptive soft-switching median filter;switching-based median filters;noise density variations;pixel classification;high noise density interference;adaptive weighted median filter;fuzzy-set concept;filtering performance;soft-switching noise-detection;uncorrupted pixel;isolated impulse noise;nonisolated impulse noise;image object edge pixel;experimental results","","360","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This makes it practicable for only a few independent power suppliers to service a given geographic region and in this imperfect market each power supplier can increase its own profit through strategic bidding. The profit of each supplier is influenced to varying extents by differences in the degree of imperfection of knowledge of rival suppliers. A new framework to build bidding strategies for power suppliers in an electricity market is presented in this paper. It is assumed that each supplier bids a linear supply function, and that the system is dispatched to minimize customer payments. Each supplier chooses the coefficients in the linear supply function to maximize benefits, subject to expectations about how rival suppliers will bid. A stochastic optimization formulation is developed and two methods proposed for describing and solving this problem. A numerical example serves to illustrate the essential features of the approach and the results are used to investigate the potential market power.","1558-0679","","10.1109/59.910776","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910776","","Electricity supply industry;Costs;Power supplies;Power generation;Oligopoly;Stochastic processes;Power markets;Production;Investments;Propagation losses","electricity supply industry;stochastic processes;optimisation;Monte Carlo methods;power system economics","optimal bidding strategies;imperfect information modeling;competitive generators;electricity market;competitive market;large investment size;transmission constraints;transmission losses;independent power suppliers;strategic bidding;power suppliers;linear supply function;customer payments minimisation;stochastic optimization;Monte Carlo simulation","","210","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Div., California Univ., Berkeley, CA, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","","2001","47","2","736","744","Graphical models, such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields (MRFs), represent statistical dependencies of variables by a graph. The max-product ""belief propagation"" algorithm is a local-message-passing algorithm on this graph that is known to converge to a unique fixed point when the graph is a tree. Furthermore, when the graph is a tree, the assignment based on the fixed point yields the most probable values of the unobserved variables given the observed ones. Good empirical performance has been obtained by running the max-product algorithm (or the equivalent min-sum algorithm) on graphs with loops, for applications including the decoding of ""turbo"" codes. Except for two simple graphs (cycle codes and single-loop graphs) there has been little theoretical understanding of the max-product algorithm on graphs with loops. Here we prove a result on the fixed points of max-product on a graph with arbitrary topology and with arbitrary probability distributions (discrete- or continuous-valued nodes). We show that the assignment based on a fixed point is a ""neighborhood maximum"" of the posterior probability: the posterior probability of the max-product assignment is guaranteed to be greater than all other assignments in a particular large region around that assignment. The region includes all assignments that differ from the max-product assignment in any subset of nodes that form no more than a single loop in the graph. In some graphs, this neighborhood is exponentially large.

Lipa","MultiGig Ltd., Northampton, UK; NA; NA","IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","","2001","36","11","1654","1665","Rotary traveling-wave oscillators (RTWOs) represent a new transmission-line approach to gigahertz-rate clock generation. Using the inherently stable LC characteristics of on-chip VLSI interconnect, the clock distribution network becomes a low-impedance distributed oscillator. The RTWO operates by creating a rotating traveling wave within a closed-loop differential transmission line. Distributed CMOS inverters serve as both transmission-line amplifiers and latches to power the oscillation and ensure rotational lock. Load capacitance is absorbed into the transmission-line constants whereby energy is recirculated giving an adiabatic quality. Unusually for an LC oscillator, multiphase (360/spl deg/) square waves are produced directly. RTWO structures are compact and can be wired together to form rotary oscillator arrays (ROAs) to distribute a phase-locked clock over a large chip. The principle is scalable to very high clock frequencies. Issues related to interconnect and field coupling dominate the design process for RTWOs. Taking precautions to avoid unwanted signal couplings, the rise and fall times of 20 ps, suggested by simulation, may be realized at low power consumption. Experimental results of the 0.25-/spl mu/m CMOS test chip with 950-MHz and 3.4-GHz rings are presented, indicating 5,5-ps jitter and 34-dB power supply rejection ratio (PSRR).

We introduce a stochastic model of a battery, which can simultaneously model two key phenomena affecting the battery life and the amount of energy that can be delivered by the battery: the rate capacity effect and the recovery effect. We model the battery behavior mathematically in terms of parameters that can be related to physical characteristics of the electro-chemical cell. We show how this model can be used for battery life estimation of a HW/SW embedded system, by calculating battery discharge demand waveforms using a power co-estimation technique. Based on the discharge demand, the battery model estimates the battery lifetime as well as the delivered energy. Application of the battery life estimation methodology to three system implementations of an example TCP/IP network interface subsystem demonstrates that different system architectures can have significantly different delivered energy and battery lifetimes.","1063-9667","0-7695-0831-6","10.1109/ICVD.2001.902640","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=902640","","Batteries;Life estimation;Embedded system;Power system modeling;Hardware;Embedded software;Stochastic processes;Mathematical model;Lifetime estimation;TCPIP","mobile computing;hardware-software codesign;secondary cells;low-power electronics;transport protocols;stochastic processes","battery life estimation;mobile embedded systems;battery model;hardware/software embedded systems;stochastic model;rate capacity effect;recovery effect;electro-chemical cell;battery discharge demand waveforms;power co-estimation technique;delivered energy;TCP/IP network interface subsystem","","129","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main reason for considering CLRFs is construction of robust stabilizing control laws for time delay systems. Most existing universal formulas that apply to CLFs, are not applicable to CLRFs. It turns out that the domination redesign control law applies, achieving global practical stability and, under an additional assumption, global asymptotic stability. This additional assumption is satisfied in the practically important case when the quadratic part of a CLRF is itself a CLRF for the Jacobian linearization of the system. The CLRF based domination redesign possesses robustness to input unmodeled dynamics including an infinite gain margin.

Performance improvement with respect to existing algorithms is obtained by means of a new approach to mask the watermark according to the characteristics of the human visual system (HVS). In contrast to conventional methods operating in the wavelet domain, masking is accomplished pixel by pixel by taking into account the texture and the luminance content of all the image subbands. The watermark consists of a pseudorandom sequence which is adaptively added to the largest detail bands. As usual, the watermark is detected by computing the correlation between the watermarked coefficients and the watermarking code, and the detection threshold is chosen in such a way that the knowledge of the watermark energy used in the embedding phase is not needed, thus permitting one to adapt it to the image at hand.

Maximum likelihood timing synchronization techniques can be easily incorporated into the polyphase filter bank in a natural way. An M-stage polyphase filterbank with input data sampled at approximately N samples/symbol can be used in a loop that operates at MN samples/symbol, N samples/symbol, or 1 sample/symbol.

The study of the GSC(M, L) receiver is also important from a theoretical standpoint because this model encapsulates both the classical selection combining receiver and the maximal-ratio combining receiver as limiting cases. Despite its importance, published results on GSC(M, L) receiver performance in a generalized fading channel are still very limited, mainly due to the mathematical difficulty encountered while computing the first-order statistics of a linear sum of ordered random variables. This paper provides a partial solution to the problem on hand by deriving relatively simple-to-evaluate expressions for the moment generating function (MGF) of GSC output SNR in a variety of fading environments given that the individual branch SNRs are independent and identically distributed. Moreover, our generic single integral expression for the MGF of GSC output SNR reduces to a closed-form formula if the branch amplitudes follow either Rayleigh or Nakagami-m (positive integer fading index) distribution. An easily programmable recursive solution of the MGF in Nakagami-m channels is also provided. Our expressions hold for any M and L values, and thus facilitate a comprehensive analysis of GSC systems including the average symbol error probability (ASEP) analysis of a broad class of binary and M-ary modulations, average combined SNR and the outage rate of error probability analysis.","1090-3038","0-7803-7005-8","10.1109/VTC.2001.957159","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=957159","","Diversity reception;Rayleigh channels;Error probability;Error analysis;Wideband;Multiaccess communication;Millimeter wave communication;Fading;Statistics;Random variables","Rayleigh channels;fading channels;error statistics;statistical analysis;diversity reception;radio receivers;cellular radio;code division multiple access;spread spectrum communication","generalized selection diversity receivers;wireless channels;wideband cellular DS-CDMA;millimeter-wave communications;generalized selection combining receiver;maximal-ratio combining receiver;generalized fading channel;first-order statistics;moment generating function;SNR;generic single integral expression;Rayleigh fading channels;Nakagami fading channels;Nakagami-m channels;average symbol error probability;binary modulation;outage rate;M-ary modulations","","38","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This strategy, termed discontinuous leading/trailing edge (DLTE) modulation, serves to maximize the duty cycle of the input switch while keeping the current in the buck-boost inductor discontinuous. Hence, the crest factors of the currents in the switching devices are minimized, the input switch is turned on at zero current and the zero-voltage switching ranges of the bridge switches are unaffected by the integration. A conventional isolated, PFC AC/DC converter typically consists of a boost converter cascaded with a forward converter. The ratings required of the power switching devices of the 2SBBDAB employing the DLTE modulation strategy are similar to those required of the conventional design for wide line voltage operation. However, the 2SBBDAB converter has higher line voltage surge immunity than that of the conventional design and, unlike the conventional design, it has inherent inrush current limiting. The DLTE modulation strategy may be applied to the family of converters composed of the two switch buck-boost integrated with half and full-bridge forward converters.","1941-0107","","10.1109/63.903987","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=903987","","DC-DC power converters;Switches;Bridge circuits;Analog-digital conversion;Surges;Switching converters;Reactive power;Inductors;Zero voltage switching;Current limiters","AC-DC power convertors;power factor correction;switching circuits;bridge circuits;surges;DC-DC power convertors;modulation","modulation strategy;buck-boost input AC/DC converter;power factor correction;isolated AC/DC converter;nonisolated two switch buck-boost AC/DC converter;isolated dual active bridge DC/DC converter;discontinuous leading/trailing edge modulation;input switch duty cycle maximisation;buck-boost inductor;current crest factors;switching devices;zero-voltage switching;bridge switches;boost converter;forward converter;wide line voltage operation;voltage surge immunity;inrush current limiting;full-bridge forward converters;half-bridge forward converters","","12","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the calibration loop, the fractional spurs caused by the delay mismatches are reduced to -55 dBc, and the corresponding maximum phase offsets between the multiphase signals is less than 0.20. The frequency synthesizer PLL operates from 1.7 to 1.9 GHz and the closed-loop phase noise is -105 dBc/Hz at 100-kHz offset from the carrier.

No.01TH8589)","","2001","","","413","418","To meet the increasing world demand for energy, the rate of depletion of non-renewable energy sources must be reduced while developing alternative renewable sources. This can be achieved by increasing the overall thermal efficiency of conventional power plants. One way to do this is by waste heat recovery. Most of the techniques currently available recover waste heat in the form of thermal energy which is then converted to electricity in a conventional steam power plant. Another approach which has received little attention so far is direct conversion of thermal waste energy into electricity. Thermoelectrics is the science dealing with both low-temperature and high-temperature thermal to electrical energy conversion systems. The paper describes a pilot program to investigate the applicability of thermoelectric generators to the recovery of medium-temperature waste heat from a low-power stationary diesel engine. Commercial thermoelectric modules using bismuth telluride based alloys and consisting of 98 couples were used. The modules require a heat source capable of supplying a heat flux of about 8 W/cm/sup 2/. With a temperature difference of 200/spl deg/C, each module converts 5% of the thermal energy that passes through it into electricity generating 14 W of electrical power. Heat transfer modelling was used to locate the optimum mounting position of the waste heat recovery system (WHRS) on the exhaust pipe. A compact device was then designed incorporating six modules with the exhaust pipe acting as the heat source. The required minimum temperature on the cold side of the modules was provided by using water-cooled heat sinks. Tests have shown that the performance specified by the manufacturer can be reproduced. One promising application for the tested WHRD is as a source of electrical power in motor vehicles in lieu of or in addition to the alternator. A detailed analysis of this application is also presented.","1094-2734","0-7803-7205-0","10.1109/ICT.2001.979919","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=979919","","Heat engines;Heat recovery;Waste heat;Diesel engines;Energy conversion;Power generation;Thermoelectricity;Temperature;Heat transfer;Testing","thermoelectric conversion;internal combustion engines","power plants thermal efficiency;waste heat recovery;low-power diesel engine;thermoelectrics;high-temperature thermal to electrical energy conversion;low-temperature thermal to electrical energy conversion;thermoelectric generators;medium-temperature waste heat;low-power stationary diesel engine;bismuth telluride based alloys;heat source;heat flux;heat transfer modelling;optimum mounting position;exhaust pipe;water cooled heat sinks;14 W;200 C","","24","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typically, currents are injected into the object through electrodes placed on its surface, and the resulting electrode voltages are measured. An appropriate set of current patterns, with each pattern specifying the value of the current for each electrode, is applied to the object, and a reconstruction algorithm uses knowledge of the applied current patterns and the measured electrode voltages to solve the inverse problem, computing the electrical conductivity and permittivity distributions in the object. This article focuses on the type of EIT called adaptive current tomography (ACT) in which currents are applied simultaneously to all the electrodes. A number of current patterns are applied, where each pattern defines the current for each electrode, and the subsequent electrode voltages are measured to generate the data required for image reconstruction. A ring of electrodes may be placed in a single plane around the object, to define a two-dimensional problem, or in several layers of such rings, to define a three-dimensional problem. The reconstruction problem is described and two algorithms are discussed, a one-step, two-dimensional (2-D) Newton-Raphson algorithm and a one-step, full three-dimensional (3-D) reconstructor.

A complete vision-based system, consisting of hand gesture acquisition, segmentation, filtering, representation and classification, is developed to robustly classify hand gestures. The algorithms in the subsystems are formulated or selected to optimality classify hand gestures. The gray-scale image of a hand gesture is segmented using a histogram thresholding algorithm. A morphological filtering approach is designed to effectively remove background and object noise in the segmented image. The contour of a gesture is represented by a localized contour sequence whose samples are the perpendicular distances between the contour pixels and the chord connecting the end-points of a window centered on the contour pixels. Gesture similarity is determined by measuring the similarity between the localized contour sequences of the gestures. Linear alignment and nonlinear alignment are developed to measure the similarity between the localized contour sequences. Experiments and evaluations on a subset of American Sign Language (ASL) hand gestures show that, by using nonlinear alignment, no gestures are misclassified by the system.

The research has demonstrated that linear active noise control (ANC) systems can be successfully applied to reduce the broadband noise and narrowband noise, specifically, such linear ANC systems are very efficient in reduction of low-frequency noise. However, in some situations, the noise that comes from a dynamic system may he a nonlinear and deterministic noise process rather than a stochastic, white, or tonal noise process, and the primary noise at the canceling point may exhibit nonlinear distortion. Furthermore, the secondary path estimate in the ANC system, which denotes the transfer function between the secondary source (secondary speaker) and the error microphone, may have nonminimum phase, and hence, the causality constraint is violated. If such situations exist, the linear ANC system will suffer performance degradation. An implementation of a Volterra filtered-X LMS (VFXLMS) algorithm based on a multichannel structure is described for feedforward active noise control. Numerical simulation results show that the developed algorithm achieves performance improvement over the standard filtered-X LMS algorithm for the following two situations: (1) the reference noise is a nonlinear noise process, and at the same time, the secondary path estimate is of nonminimum phase; (2) the primary path exhibits the nonlinear behavior. In addition, the developed VFXLMS algorithm can also be employed as an alternative in the case where the standard filtered-X LMS algorithm does not perform well.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.934136","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=934136","","Programmable control;Adaptive control;Active filters;Adaptive filters;Active noise reduction;Low-frequency noise;Noise cancellation;Least squares approximation;Phase estimation;Standards development","adaptive filters;adaptive signal processing;filtering theory;active noise control;least mean squares methods;feedforward","adaptive Volterra filters;nonlinear noise processes;Volterra filtered-X LMS algorithm;feedforward active noise control;linear active noise control;low-frequency noise reduction;broadband noise;narrowband noise;linear ANC systems;dynamic system;deterministic noise;nonlinear distortion;secondary path estimate;transfer function;secondary source;secondary speaker;error microphone;nonminimum phase estimate;causality constraint;multichannel structure;numerical simulation results;filtered-X LMS algorithm;reference noise","","194","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, we introduce a randomized tracking algorithm adapted from an existing probabilistic data association filter (PDAF) that is resistant to clutter and follows agile motion. The algorithm is applied to three different tracking modalities-homogeneous regions, textured regions, and snakes-and extensibly defined for straightforward inclusion of other methods. Second, we add the capacity to track multiple objects by adapting to vision a joint PDAF which oversees correspondence choices between same-modality trackers and image features. We then derive a related technique that allows mixed tracker modalities and handles object overlaps robustly. Finally, we represent complex objects as conjunctions of cues that are diverse both geometrically (e.g., parts) and qualitatively (e.g., attributes). Rigid and hinge constraints between part trackers and multiple descriptive attributes for individual parts render the whole object more distinctive, reducing susceptibility to mistracking.

In general, they have a complex structure of dependencies. Pairwise dependency is easily represented by correlation, but it is more difficult to measure effects of pure triplewise or higher order interactions (dependencies) among these variables. Stochastic dependency is decomposed quantitatively into an ""orthogonal"" sum of pairwise, triplewise, and further higher order dependencies. This gives a new invariant decomposition of joint entropy. This problem is important for extracting intrinsic interactions in firing patterns of an ensemble of neurons and for estimating its functional connections.

CVPR 2001","","2001","1","","I","I","A problem in uncalibrated stereo reconstruction is that cameras which deviate from the pinhole model have to be pre-calibrated in order to correct for nonlinear lens distortion. If they are not, and point correspondence is attempted using the uncorrected images, the matching constraints provided by the fundamental matrix must be set so loose that point matching is significantly hampered. This paper shows how linear estimation of the fundamental matrix from two-view point correspondences may be augmented to include one term of radial lens distortion. This is achieved by (1) changing from the standard radial-lens model to another which (as we show) has equivalent power, but which takes a simpler form in homogeneous coordinates, and (2) expressing fundamental matrix estimation as a quadratic eigenvalue problem (QEP), for which efficient algorithms are well known. I derive the new estimator, and compare its performance against bundle-adjusted calibration-grid data. The new estimator is fast enough to be included in a RANSAC-based matching loop, and we show cases of matching being rendered possible by its use. I show how the same lens can be calibrated in a natural scene where the lack of straight lines precludes most previous techniques. The modification when the multi-view relation is a planar homography or trifocal tensor is described.","1063-6919","0-7695-1272-0","10.1109/CVPR.2001.990465","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=990465","","Geometry;Lenses;Nonlinear distortion;Transmission line matrix methods;Stereo image processing;Image reconstruction;Cameras;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Layout;Tensile stress","calibration;lenses;image matching;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;matrix algebra","linear estimation;fundamental matrix;two-view point correspondences;radial lens distortion;multiple view geometry;homogeneous coordinates;quadratic eigenvalue problem;bundle-adjusted calibration grid data;RANSAC-based matching loop;natural scene;planar homography;trifocal tensor;uncalibrated stereo reconstruction;matching constraints","","192","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Department of Energy's (DOE's) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) is developing fuel cells for various applications in partnership with the private sector. Fuel cell technologies-solid oxide fuel cells, molten carbonate fuel cells, and polymer electrolyte fuel cells-are being developed for the distributed generation market shortly after 2003. Some of the evolving fuel cell systems are incorporating gas turbines in hybrid configurations. The combination of the gas turbine with the fuel cell promises to lower system costs and increase efficiency to enhance market penetration. Hybrid efforts are underway at Honeywell, Fuel Cell Energy and Siemens Westinghouse. In the long term, solid state fuel cell technology with stack costs under $100/kilowatt (kW) promises deeper and wider market penetration in a range of applications including a residential, auxiliary power, and the mature distributed generation markets. The Solid State Energy Conversion Alliance (SECA) with its vision for fuel cells in 2010 was recently formed to commercialize solid-state fuel cells and realize the full potential of the fuel cell technology. Ultimately, the SECA concept could lead to megawatt-size fuel cell systems for commercial and industrial applications and Vision 21 fuel cell turbine hybrid energy plants in 2015. Substantial new efforts in SECA are underway at Honeywell, McDermott and Delphi.","","0-7803-7173-9","10.1109/PESS.2001.970132","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=970132","","Fuel cells;Turbines;Solid state circuits;Laboratories;Distributed control;Costs;US Department of Energy;Polymers;Tellurium;Energy conversion","fuel cell power plants;gas turbine power stations;gas turbines;solid oxide fuel cells;molten carbonate fuel cells;proton exchange membrane fuel cells","US Department of Energy;solid oxide fuel cells;molten carbonate fuel cells;polymer electrolyte fuel cells;distributed power generation;gas turbines;solid state fuel cell technology;fuel cell turbine hybrid energy plants","","21","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using a continuous perturbation of the width of the coupled lines following a sinusoidal law, the wave impedance is modulated so that the harmonic passband of the filter is rejected while the desired passband response is maintained virtually unaltered. This strip-width perturbation does not require the filter parameters to be recalculated and, this way, the classical design methodology for coupled-line microstrip filters can still be used. At the same time, the fabrication of the resulting filter layout does not involve more difficulties than those for typical coupled-line microstrip filters. To test this novel technique, 3rd-order Butterworth bandpass filters have been designed at 2.5 GHz, with a 10% fractional bandwidth and different values of the perturbation amplitude. It is shown that for a 47.5 % sinusoidal variation of the nominal strip width, a harmonic rejection of more than 40 dB is achieved in measurement while the passband at 2.5 GHz is almost unaltered.","1557-9670","","10.1109/22.942571","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=942571","","Microstrip filters;Band pass filters;Passband;Power harmonic filters;Impedance;Design methodology;Fabrication;Testing;Bandwidth;Strips","microstrip filters;band-pass filters;passive filters;UHF filters;harmonics suppression;microwave filters;coupled transmission lines;Butterworth filters;linear network synthesis","microstrip wiggly-line filters;spurious passband suppression;parallel-coupled-line microstrip filter;microstrip bandpass filter;wave impedance modulation;harmonic passband rejection;strip-width perturbation;coupled-line microstrip filters;3rd-order Butterworth filters;2.5 GHz","","221","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The site matching is based on identifying optimum turbine speed parameters from turbine performance index curve, which is obtained from the normalized curves, so as to yield higher energy production at higher capacity factor. The wind speeds are parameterized using cubic mean cuberoot and statistically modeled using Weibull probability density function. An expression for normalized power and capacity factor, expressed entirely in normalized rated speed, is derived. Wind Turbine Performance Index, a new ranking parameter, is defined to optimally match turbines to a potential wind site. The plots of normalized power, capacity factor and turbine performance index versus normalized rated wind speed are drawn for a known value of Weibull shape parameter of a site. Usefulness of these normalized curves for identifying optimum wind turbine generator parameters for a site is presented by means of two illustrative case studies. The generalized curves, if used at the planning and development stages of wind power stations, will serve as useful tool to make a judicious choice of a wind turbine generator that yields higher energy at higher capacity factor.","1558-0059","","10.1109/60.937209","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=937209","","Wind turbines;Wind energy generation;Performance analysis;Power generation;Wind speed;Production;Probability density function;Shape;Wind energy;Capacity planning","wind power plants;wind turbines;turbogenerators;parameter estimation;optimisation;power generation planning;Weibull distribution","optimum wind turbine generator parameters identification;normalized power curves;site matching;turbine performance index curve;energy production;capacity factor;Weibull probability density function;cubic mean cuberoot;Wind Turbine Performance Index;ranking parameter;case studies;planning;development;wind turbine generator","","85","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Eng., Padova Univ., Italy","IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","","2001","37","3","864","872","In order to achieve the reduction of voltage distortion in AC power supplies (ACPSs), this paper describes an implementation of synchronous-frame control for selected frequencies in the output voltage. The regulation of the fundamental output voltage, as well as that of some low-order harmonics, is achieved using a synchronous-frame controller for each selected frequency in addition to a conventional control. The conventional part conserves good dynamic performance under load changes, while rotating-frame controllers allow a slow, but very precise compensation of the residual errors within the assumption that the harmonics produced by distorting load are slowly varying. Moreover, motivated by a fixed-point implementation, a set of refinements and modifications of the original scheme is proposed, allowing a reduction of signal processing requirements and a new control algorithm structure less sensitive to quantization and rounding errors. This solution is particularly effective for high-power fully digitally controlled ACPSs, where the voltage loop bandwidth is usually not large enough to provide regulation at harmonic frequencies. The proposed control scheme has been implemented using a fixed-point single-chip digital signal processor (ADMC401 by Analog Devices). Experimental results on a 3-kVA three-phase converter prototype show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","1939-9367","","10.1109/28.924769","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=924769","","Power system harmonics;Voltage control;Frequency;Signal processing algorithms;Power supplies;Error correction;Harmonic distortion;Quantization;Roundoff errors;Digital control","power supplies to apparatus;power conversion harmonics;harmonic distortion;harmonics suppression;voltage control;control system synthesis;DC-AC power convertors;invertors","high-performance AC power supplies;synchronous-frame harmonic control;voltage distortion reduction;fundamental output voltage regulation;synchronous-frame controller;dynamic performance;residual errors compensation;control algorithm structure;voltage loop bandwidth;fixed-point single-chip digital signal processor;ADMC401;three-phase power converter;voltage source invertors;control design;control performance;3 kVA","","189","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We derive the ergodic capacity region of an M-user fading broadcast channel for code division (CD), time division (TD), and frequency division (FD), assuming that both the transmitter and the receivers have perfect channel side information (CSI). It is shown that by allowing dynamic resource allocation, TD, FD, and CD without successive decoding have the same ergodic capacity region, while optimal CD has a larger region. Optimal resource allocation policies are obtained for these different spectrum-sharing techniques. A simple suboptimal policy is also proposed for TD and CD without successive decoding that results in a rate region quite close to the ergodic capacity region.

The latter bilateral model turns out to be equivalent to a Cournot model of a POOLCO. The models differ from other Cournot market models in that they include both of Kirchhoff's laws via a DC approximation; can include arbitragers; possess unique solutions; and are readily solved by efficient LCP algorithms.

The control law that maintains stable operation of a platoon is dependent on the lead and preceding vehicle's position, velocity and acceleration profiles. These profiles guarantee string stability of a platoon and are transmitted via wireless communication networks. Communication networks generally introduce delays and drop packets. However, these communication faults are not typically taken into account in controller designs. In this paper, we examine the robustness of current longitudinal controller designs to communication delays. The results show that string stability is seriously compromised by communication delays introduced by the network when the controllers are triggered by the receipt of either the lead vehicle information or the preceding vehicle information. We find that when all the vehicles are synchronized to update their controllers at the same time, string stability can be maintained if the delay in preceding vehicle information is small. An upper bound on the preceding vehicle information delay is derived through a simple partial fraction expansion approach. We also point out a potential problem due to the clock jitters associated with the synchronization among vehicles.","","0-7803-7194-1","10.1109/ITSC.2001.948732","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=948732","","Delay effects;Stability;Communication system control;Road vehicles;Synchronization;Throughput;Road transportation;Velocity control;Acceleration;Wireless communication","automated highways;delays;traffic information systems","communication delay;string stability;vehicle platoons;throughput of vehicles;highways;robustness;longitudinal controller designs;upper bound;partial fraction expansion approach;clock jitters;automated highway system","","29","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among a total of 27 switching states in the NPC inverter, the proposed PWM uses only 19 switching states that generate common-mode voltage of which the magnitude is the same or less than one-sixth of DC-bus voltage. Moreover, the proposed PWM strategy satisfied the constraint that the output voltage vector should be changed by only one switching action. Not requiring extra hardware, the NPC inverter with the proposed PWM results in a remarkable reduction in peak-to-peak of common-mode voltage, compared to a two-level inverter and an NPC inverter controlled by conventional PWM.

This study emphasizes fusion techniques that are suitable for noncommensurate data sampled at noncoincident points. Decision-level fusion is most convenient for such data, but it is suboptimal in principle, since targets not detected by all sensors will not obtain the full benefits of fusion. A novel algorithm for feature-level fusion of noncommensurate, noncoincidently sampled data is described, in which a model is fitted to the sensor data and the model parameters are used as features. Formulations for both feature-level and decision-level fusion are described, along with some practical simplifications. A closed-form expression is available for feature-level fusion of normally distributed data and this expression is used with simulated data to study requirements for sample position accuracy in multisensor data. The performance of feature-level and decision-level fusion algorithms are compared for experimental data acquired by a metal detector, a ground-penetrating radar, and an infrared camera at a challenging test site containing surrogate mines. It is found that fusion of binary decisions does not perform significantly better than the best available sensor. The performance of feature-level fusion is significantly better than the individual sensors, as is decision-level fusion when detection confidence information is also available (""soft-decision"" fusion).","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.927459","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=927459","","Sensor fusion;Landmine detection;Infrared detectors;Radar detection;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Ground penetrating radar;Infrared image sensors;Chemical sensors;Chemical technology;Image sensors","buried object detection;sensor fusion","feature-level fusion;decision-level fusion;noncoincidently sampled sensors;land mine detection;predetection fusion;postdetection fusion;multisensor data fusion;noncommensurate data;closed-form expression;metal detector;ground-penetrating radar;infrared camera;soft-decision fusion;IR camera","","74","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To improve efficiency, the computational costs of features are analyzed and a multiple-model cost-based approach is used to produce detection models with low cost and high accuracy.

In this way, due to the inherent current reuse, the performances can be improved using the same power consumption. Since the devices of an inductively degenerated input stage are working in moderate inversion (at least at moderate power dissipation), prior to the stage optimization an appropriate moderate inversion model is introduced. A fully differential 900-MHz 0.35-/spl mu/m CMOS LNA (plus output buffer) prototype achieves the following performances: 2-dB noise figure (NF), 17.5-dB power gain, -6-dBm IIP3 with 8-mA current consumption from a 2.7-V voltage supply.

A new deterministic maximum likelihood (ML) DOA estimator is derived. Its implementation is based on an iterative procedure which includes a stepwise concentration of the log-likelihood (LL) function with respect to the signal and noise nuisance parameters and requires only a few iterations to converge. New closed-form expressions for the deterministic and stochastic direction estimation Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) are derived for the considered nonuniform model. Our expressions can be viewed as an extension of the well-known results by Stoica and Nehorai (1989, 1990) and Weiss and Friedlander (1993) to a more general noise model than the commonly used uniform one. In addition, these expressions extend the results obtained by Matveyev et al. (see Circuits, Syst., Signal Process., vol.18, p.479-87, 1999) to the multiple source case. Comparisons with the above-mentioned earlier results help to discover several interesting properties of DOA estimation in the nonuniform noise case. To compare the estimation performance of the proposed ML technique with the results of our CRB analysis and with the performance of conventional ""uniform"" ML, simulation results are presented. Additionally, we test our technique using experimental seismic array data.

The ripple-free control current eliminates the need for an additional filtering pole, leading to a nearly 90/spl deg/ phase margin which minimizes input jitter peaking and transient locking overshoot. The PLL damping factor is made insensitive to process variations by making it dependent only upon a bandgap voltage and ratios of circuit elements.

This paper proposes to use a simple non-weighted features KNN algorithm for text categorization. We propose to use a feature selection method that finds the relevant features for the learning task at hand using feature interaction (based on word interdependencies). This will allow us to reduce considerably the number Of selected features from which to learn, making our KNN algorithm applicable in contexts where both the volume of documents and the size of the vocabulary are high, like with the World Wide Web. Therefore, the KNN algorithm that we propose becomes efficient for classifying text documents in that context (in terms of its predictability and interpretability), as is demonstrated.

The speed bottleneck in the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm is in the iterative computation of discrepancies followed by the updating of the error-locator polynomial. This bottleneck is eliminated via a series of algorithmic transformations that result in a fully systolic architecture in which a single array of processors computes both the error-locator and the error-evaluator polynomials. In contrast to conventional Berlekamp-Massey architectures in which the critical path passes through two multipliers and 1+[log/sub 2/,(t+1)] adders, the critical path in the proposed architecture passes through only one multiplier and one adder, which is comparable to the critical path in architectures based on the extended Euclidean algorithm. More interestingly, the proposed architecture requires approximately 25% fewer multipliers and a simpler control structure than the architectures based on the popular extended Euclidean algorithm. For block-interleaved Reed-Solomon codes, embedding the interleaver memory into the decoder results in a further reduction of the critical path delay to just one XOR gate and one multiplexer, leading to speed-ups of as much as an order of magnitude over conventional architectures.","1557-9999","","10.1109/92.953498","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=953498","","Reed-Solomon codes;Computer architecture;Delay;Iterative decoding;Iterative algorithms;Polynomials;Very large scale integration;Galois fields;Multiplexing;Uninterruptible power systems","Reed-Solomon codes;VLSI;high-speed integrated circuits;iterative decoding;systolic arrays;interleaved codes;pipeline processing","high-speed architectures;Reed-Solomon decoders;VLSI architectures;Berlekamp-Massey algorithm;iterative computation;updating;error-locator polynomial;algorithmic transformations;systolic architecture;error-evaluator polynomials;error-locator polynomials;multiplier;adder;block-interleaved codes;interleaver memory;critical path delay","","179","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

If the correct key is specified in the watermark extraction procedure, then an output image is returned showing a proper watermark, indicating the image is authentic and has not been changed since the insertion of the watermark. Any modification would be reflected in a corresponding error in the watermark. If the key is incorrect, or if the image was not watermarked, or if the watermarked image is cropped, the watermark extraction algorithm will return an image that resembles random noise. Since it requires a user key during both the insertion and the extraction procedures, it is not possible for an unauthorized user to insert a new watermark or alter the existing watermark so that the resulting image will pass the test.

The instantaneous direction of motion associated with this single degree of freedom is actively servo-controlled, or steered, within the higher dimensional taskspace.

For example, in Finland, more than 30% of the first pulse data of laser scanning reflect directly from the ground without any interaction with the canopy. By increasing the number of pulses, it is possible to have samples from each individual tree and also from the gaps between the trees. Basically, this means that several laser pulses can be recorded per m/sup 2/. This allows detailed investigation of forest areas and the creation of a three-dimensional (3D) tree height model. Tree height model can be calculated from the digital terrain and crown models both obtained with the laser scanner data. By analyzing the 3D tree height model by using image vision methods, e.g., segmentation, it is possible to locate individual trees, estimate individual tree heights, crown area, and, by using that data, to derive the stem diameter, number of stems, basal area, and stem volume. The advantage of the method is the capability to measure directly physical dimensions from the trees and use that information to calculate the needed stand attributes. This paper demonstrates for the first time that it is possible to accurately estimate standwise forest attributes, especially stem volume (biomass), using high-pulse-rate laser scanners to provide data, from which individual trees can be detected and characteristics of trees such as height, location, and crown dimensions can be determined. That information can be applied to provide estimates for larger areas (stands). Using the new method, the following standard errors were demonstrated for mean height, basal area and stem volume: 1.8 m (9.9%), 2.0 m/sup 2//ha (10.2%), and 18.5 m/sup 3//ha (10.5%), respectively.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.921414","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=921414","","Laser modes;Remote sensing;Optical pulses;Biomass;Satellites;Laser radar;Data analysis;Image analysis;Image segmentation;Laser theory","geophysical techniques;vegetation mapping;forestry;remote sensing by laser beam;optical radar","geophysical measurement technique;laser remote sensing;airborne lidar;forest inventory;tree trunk;stem volume;biomass;forestry;vegetation mapping;three dimensional structure;tree height model;canopy;laser scanner;stem diameter;boreal forest;high pulse rate","","393","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Amin","EPRI, Palo Alto, CA, USA","IEEE Computer Applications in Power","","2001","14","1","20","28","Virtually every crucial economic and social function depends on the secure, reliable operation of energy, telecommunications, transportation, financial, and other infrastructures. However, with increased benefit has come increased risk. As they have grown more complex to handle a variety of demands, these infrastructures have become more interdependent. This strong interdependence means that an action in one part of one infrastructure network can rapidly create global effects by cascading throughout the same network and even into other networks. Moreover, interdependence is only one of several characteristics that challenge the control and reliable operation of these networks. These characteristics, in turn, present unique challenges in modeling, prediction, simulation, cause-and-effect relationships, analysis, optimization, and control. Deregulation and economic factors and policies and human performance also affect these networks. The Complex Interactive Networks/Systems Initiative (GIN/SI) is a joint program by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the US Department of Defense (DOD) that is addressing many of these issues. The goal of the 5-year, $30 million effort, which is part of the Government-Industry Collaborative University Research (GICUR) program, is to develop new tools and techniques that will enable large national infrastructures to self-heal in response to threats, material failures, and other destabilizers.

We call such time series ""ARIMA time series"". We propose the use of the linear predictive coding (LPC) cepstrum for clustering ARIMA time series, by using the Euclidean distance between the LPC cepstra of two time series as their dissimilarity measure. We demonstrate that LPC cepstral coefficients have the desired features for accurate clustering and efficient indexing of ARIMA time series. For example, just a few LPC cepstral coefficients are sufficient in order to discriminate between time series that are modeled by different ARIMA models. In fact, this approach requires fewer coefficients than traditional approaches, such as DFT (discrete Fourier transform) and DWT (discrete wavelet transform). The proposed distance measure can be used for measuring the similarity between different ARIMA models as well. We cluster ARIMA time series using the ""partition around medoids"" method with various similarity measures. We present experimental results demonstrating that, using the proposed measure, we achieve significantly better clusterings of ARIMA time series data as compared to clusterings obtained by using other traditional similarity measures, such as DFT, DWT, PCA (principal component analysis), etc. Experiments were performed both on simulated and real data.","","0-7695-1119-8","10.1109/ICDM.2001.989529","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=989529","","Linear predictive coding;Time measurement;Discrete Fourier transforms;Discrete wavelet transforms;Cepstral analysis;Principal component analysis;Cepstrum;Euclidean distance;Indexing;Fourier transforms","autoregressive moving average processes;time series;pattern clustering;linear predictive coding;cepstral analysis;environmental factors;socio-economic effects;social sciences;economic cybernetics;data mining;temporal databases","distance measure;ARIMA time-series clustering;environmental data;socioeconomic data;autoregressive integrated moving average;linear predictive coding;LPC cepstral coefficients;Euclidean distance;dissimilarity measure;indexing;partition-around-medoids method;similarity measures","","139","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the present work, the resonance behavior of a single U-slot microstrip patch antenna is studied. Two approximate equations for the operating frequencies of a single U-slot microstrip patch antenna are derived by analyzing the surface current distribution on the microstrip patch.

One way of generating electricity from renewable sources is to use wind turbines. A tendency to erect more wind turbines can be observed. As a result of this, in the near future wind turbines may start to influence the behavior of electrical power systems. To investigate the impact of increasing wind turbine penetration, power system dynamics studies need to be carried out. To this end, power system dynamics simulation software is used, in which wind turbine models must be integrated to enable the investigation of increasing wind turbine penetration on power system behavior. If wind turbine models are to be integrated into power system dynamics simulation software, it must be possible to calculate the initial conditions of the dynamic model from load flow data to be able to initialize the dynamic simulation correctly.

Queries aggregate measure values over a range of dimension values to provide results such as total sales per month of a given product. Multidimensional database technology is being applied to distributed data and to new types of data that current technology often cannot adequately analyze. For example, classic techniques such as preaggregation cannot ensure fast query response times when data-such as that obtained from sensors or GPS-equipped moving objects-changes continuously.

Level-up transition from 0.9 V to 3.6 V takes only 1 ns in time, and the level-down transition has no minimum core voltage limitation. These circuits do not consume static DC power, therefore they are very suitable for low-power and high-speed interfaces in the deep sub-quarter-micron CMOS technologies.","1524-766X","0-7803-6412-0","10.1109/VTSA.2001.934546","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=934546","","CMOS technology;MOSFET circuits;Zero voltage switching;Protection;MOS devices;Variable structure systems;Switches;Stress;Breakdown voltage;Threshold voltage","CMOS digital integrated circuits;integrated circuit interconnections;copper;VLSI;high-speed integrated circuits;reference circuits","level shifters;high-speed interfaces;Cu-interconnection CMOS technology;low-k CMOS technology;voltage clamps;NMOS switches;high voltage stress;level-down shifter;low-power interfaces;deep sub-quarter-micron CMOS technologies;1 to 3.3 V;0.13 micron;Cu","","14","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Three major issues are addressed: current regulator design; saturation techniques for current regulators in order to ensure best performance under voltage constraints; and flux regulator design to minimize transient errors when varying flux. Maximum DC-bus utilization through the proper use of saturation techniques, dynamic response and reduced sensitivity are the advantages of the proposed solution.","1939-9367","","10.1109/28.903125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=903125","","Voltage;Torque;Regulators;Inverters;Traction motors;Steady-state;Electric machines;Industry Applications Society;Power electronics;Production","induction motors;machine vector control;control system synthesis;electric current control;magnetic flux;magnetic variables control;machine theory;torque control;control system analysis;dynamic response;sensitivity analysis","field-weakening operation;current regulation;flux regulation;maximum torque capability;steady-state operation;DC-bus voltage sensitivity;machine parameters sensitivity;current regulator design;saturation techniques;flux regulator design;voltage constraints;dynamic response;maximum DC-bus utilization;induction motor vector control","","82","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Firstly, the statistical average of the ICI could be used as a performance measure. Secondly, the bit error rate (BER) caused by CFO could be approximated by assuming the ICI to be Gaussian. However, a more precise analysis of the performance (i.e., BER or SER) degradation is desirable. In this letter, we propose a precise numerical technique for calculating the effect of the CFO on the BER or symbol error in an OFDM system. The subcarriers can be modulated with binary phase shift keying (BPSK), quaternary phase shift keying (QPSK), or 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM), used in many OFDM applications. The BPSK case is solved using a series due to Beaulieu (1990). For the QPSK and 16-QAM cases, we use an infinite series expression for the error function in order to express the average probability of error in terms of the two-dimensional characteristic function of the ICI.","1558-0857","","10.1109/26.966051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=966051","","Probability;OFDM;Bit error rate;Binary phase shift keying;Performance analysis;Degradation;Quadrature amplitude modulation;Quadrature phase shift keying;Frequency division multiplexing;Interference","OFDM modulation;quadrature phase shift keying;phase shift keying;quadrature amplitude modulation;error statistics;AWGN channels","OFDM systems;intercarrier interference;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;carrier frequency offset;bit error rate;BER;precise numerical technique;symbol error rate;binary phase shift keying;BPSK;quaternary phase shift keying;QPSK;quadrature amplitude modulation;16-QAM;infinite series expression;average error probability","","202","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Eng., Gergard-Mercator Univ., Duidburg, Germany; NA","IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","","2001","49","7","1277","1288","In this paper, design equations for three-port power dividers have been derived. These design equations are available for both arbitrary power divisions and arbitrary termination impedances, and many sets of design equations are possible. Therefore, the design equations may be called general design equations and an arbitrary design impedance A is introduced to describe them. On the basis of the derived general design equations, a coplanar three-port power divider with a power split ratio (3 dB) terminated by 50, 60, and 70 /spl Omega/ is designed with A=33.33 /spl Omega/, so that a commercially available resistor 100 /spl Omega/ can be used for the isolation resistance. Additionally, to reduce the size of transmission-line impedance transformers, two types of small-sized impedance transformers are designed, named a constant VSWR-type transmission-line impedance transformer (CVT) and a constant conductance-type transmission-line impedance transformer (CCT) and compared with conventional reduced-sized impedance transformers. These impedance transformers are designed in the low-Q region on the Smith chart. Therefore, they show wide-band properties. To make sure that the derived design equations of CVTs and CCTs are reasonable, four 1;6:1 impedance transformers, CVT 20/spl deg/, CVT 30/spl deg/, CCT 15/spl deg/, and CCT 20/spl deg/ have been fabricated in microstrip technology and measured. The measured results show the expected tendency. Based on the CVTs and CCTs, small-sized three-port 3-dB power dividers are constructed and named a constant VSWR-type three-port 3-dB power divider (CVT3PD) and a constant conductance-type three-port 3-dB power divider (CCT3PD). For the CVT3PD and CCT3PD, perfect isolation conditions are derived, and it is shown that the perfect isolation circuit (I.C) must be composed of resistance combined with capacitance or inductance in the case that the length of transmission lines is not /spl lambda//4. These I.Cs are quite different from conventional ones composed of only resistance. Finally, on the basis of the derived perfect isolation impedance, CVT3PD and CCT3PD are designed and simulated, giving the possibility that a CCT3PD can be realized with the electrical length 15.30/spl deg/ of the transmission lines.","1557-9670","","10.1109/22.932248","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=932248","","Equations;Impedance;Transformers;Power dividers;Transmission lines;Power transmission lines;Resistors;Wideband;Microstrip;Isolation technology","power dividers;impedance convertors;microstrip components","constant VSWR-type three-port power divider;constant conductance-type three-port power divider;impedance transformer;general design equation;coplanar three-port power divider;constant VSWR-type transmission line impedance transformer;constant conductance-type transmission line impedance transformer;Smith chart;microstrip technology;isolation circuit","","88","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The authors obtain the power dynamics for both converter and inverter systems, and control the converter power so that it matches the required inverter power exactly. Then, in the ideal case, no power flows through the DC-link capacitors and, thus, the DC-link voltage does not fluctuate even though a very small amount of the DC-link capacitance is used. In forcing the converter power to match the inverter power, the authors utilize the master-slave control concept. They control the DC-link voltage level indirectly through the stored capacitor energy in order to exploit the advantage of the linear dynamic behavior of the capacitor energy. This helps them to circumvent a complex control method in regulating the DC-link voltage.

Load-balancing deals with partitioning a program into smaller tasks that can be executed concurrently and mapping each of these tasks to a computational resource such as a processor (e.g., in a multiprocessor system) or a computer (e.g., in a computer network). By developing strategies that can map these tasks to processors in a way that balances out the load, the total processing time will be reduced with improved processor utilization. Most of the research on load-balancing focused on static scenarios that, in most of the cases, employ heuristic methods. However, genetic algorithms have gained immense popularity over the last few years as a robust and easily adaptable search technique. The work proposed here investigates how a genetic algorithm can be employed to solve the dynamic load-balancing problem. A dynamic load-balancing algorithm is developed whereby optimal or near-optimal task allocations can ""evolve"" during the operation of the parallel computing system. The algorithm considers other load-balancing issues such as threshold policies, information exchange criteria, and interprocessor communication. The effects of these and other issues on the success of the genetic-based load-balancing algorithm as compared with the first-fit heuristic are outlined.","1558-2183","","10.1109/71.954620","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=954620","","Genetic algorithms;Processor scheduling;Heuristic algorithms;Scheduling algorithm;Computer networks;Concurrent computing;Parallel processing;Distributed computing;Multiprocessing systems;Robustness","genetic algorithms;resource allocation;processor scheduling;parallel processing","genetic algorithms;dynamic load-balancing;distributed computing systems;parallel computing systems;computational resource;static scenarios;dynamic load-balancing problem;task allocations;load-balancing;threshold policies;information exchange criteria;interprocessor communication;first-fit heuristic","","218","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

All relevant design parameters for plate fin heat sinks, including geometric parameters, heat dissipation, material properties and flow conditions can be simultaneously optimized to characterize a heat sink that minimizes entropy generation and in turn results in a minimum operating temperature. In addition, a novel approach for incorporating forced convection through the specification of a fan curve is integrated into the optimization procedure, providing a link between optimized design parameters and the system operating point.

The controller architecture works in such a way that the feedback control system can be solely controlled by the performance controller when there is no model uncertainties and external disturbances and the robustification controller can only be active when there are model uncertainties or external disturbances.","1558-2523","","10.1109/9.956059","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=956059","","Robust control;Fault tolerance;Uncertainty;Feedback control;Robust stability;Automatic control;Robustness;Adaptive control;Performance analysis;Control systems","robust control;H/sup /spl infin// control;feedback;fault tolerance","fault-tolerant control;robust control;feedback;robustness;controller architecture;H/sub /spl infin// control","","201","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The control algorithm is adaptive in the dynamic parameters that are poorly known and time-varying in the underwater environment. Moreover, the proposed control law adopts quaternions to represent attitude errors, and thus avoids representation singularities that occur when using instead Euler angles description of the orientation. The adaptive controller has been successfully implemented and experimentally validated on omnidirectional intelligent navigator (ODIN), an autonomous underwater vehicle that has been designed and built at the University of Hawaii.

The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of magnetic fields on intracellular hemoglobin conformation. A clear level-shift in the optical absorbance for the full range of the measured wavelengths was observed for the RBC suspension. The optical absorbance spectrum of oxyhemoglobin had two peaks in the range of 500 nm to 600 nm. The absorbance peak at 575 nm increased by 19% more than the peak at 540 nm under magnetic fields of 8 T. In the case of the hemoglobin solution, however, clear negative results were obtained. The results indicate that strong magnetic fields do not have any effect on the conformation of hemoglobin, but rather, magnetic fields affect the intracellular hemoglobin conformation. It was speculated that hemoglobin that binds to a cell membrane changes its conformation when a RBC orients along a magnetic field.","1941-0069","","10.1109/20.951343","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=951343","","Red blood cells;Suspensions;Magnetic fields;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical scattering;Optical sensors;Magnetic field measurement;Cells (biology);Superconducting magnets;Magnetic anisotropy","proteins;blood;biological effects of fields;magnetic field effects;light absorption;diamagnetism;biomagnetism;bio-optics;magneto-optical effects;visible spectra;cellular biophysics;biomembranes","optical absorbance;hemoglobin;red blood cell suspensions;magnetic fields;intracellular hemoglobin conformation;oxyhemoglobin;cell membrane;500 to 600 nm;8 T","","12","","4","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Advances in hardware and methods for fast spatio-temporal cardiac imaging are extending the frontiers of clinical diagnosis and research on cardiovascular diseases. In the last few years, many approaches have been proposed to analyze images and extract parameters of cardiac shape and function from a variety of cardiac imaging modalities. In particular, techniques based on spatio-temporal geometric models have received considerable attention. This paper surveys the literature of two decades of research on cardiac modeling. The contribution of the paper is three-fold: (1) to serve as a tutorial of the field for both clinicians and technologists, (2) to provide an extensive account of modeling techniques in a comprehensive and systematic manner, and (3) to critically review these approaches in terms of their performance and degree of clinical evaluation with respect to the final goal of cardiac functional analysis. From this review it is concluded that whereas 3-D model-based approaches have the capability to improve the diagnostic value of cardiac images, issues as robustness, 3-D interaction, computational complexity and clinical validation still require significant attention.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.906421","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=906421","","Functional analysis;Heart;Biomedical imaging;Hardware;Clinical diagnosis;Cardiovascular diseases;Image analysis;Shape;Solid modeling;Paper technology","reviews;physiological models;medical image processing;parameter estimation;diseases;cardiology","three-dimensional modeling;functional analysis;cardiac images;cardiovascular diseases;parameters extraction;cardiac modeling;clinical evaluation;3-D interaction;clinical validation;medical diagnostic imaging","Diagnostic Imaging;Heart;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Models, Cardiovascular","366","","227","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The control law superposes equivalent control, switching control, and fuzzy control. An equivalent control law is first designed using pole placement. Switching control is then added to guarantee that the state reaches the sliding mode in the presence of parameter and disturbance uncertainties. Fuzzy tuning schemes are employed to improve control performance and to reduce chattering in the sliding mode. The practical application of fuzzy logic is proposed here as a computational-intelligence approach to engineering problems associated with sliding-mode controllers. The proposed method can have a number of industrial applications including the joint control of a hydraulically actuated mini-excavator as presented in this paper. The control hardware is described together with simulated and experimental results. High performance and attenuated chatter are achieved.

However, the existing approaches are based on matching to individual training images. This paper presents a method for combining multiple images of a 3D object into a single model representation. This provides for recognition of 3D objects from any viewpoint, the generalization of models to non-rigid changes, and improved robustness through the combination of features acquired under a range of imaging conditions. The decision of whether to cluster a training image into an existing view representation or to treat it as a new view is based on the geometric accuracy of the match to previous model views. A new probabilistic model is developed to reduce the false positive matches that would otherwise arise due to loosened geometric constraints on matching 3D and non-rigid models. A system has been developed based on these approaches that is able to robustly recognize 3D objects in cluttered natural images in sub-second times.","1063-6919","0-7695-1272-0","10.1109/CVPR.2001.990541","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=990541","","Object recognition;Image recognition;Robustness;Solid modeling;Image databases;Spatial databases;Computer science;Layout;Lighting;Performance evaluation","object recognition;pattern clustering;image matching;stereo image processing;feature extraction","local feature view clustering;3D object recognition;invariant local image feature matching;training images;single model representation;nonrigid changes;robustness;imaging conditions;geometric accuracy;probabilistic model;loosened geometric constraints;nonrigid models;cluttered natural images","","197","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Lannes","Coll. of Eng., New Orleans Univ., LA, USA","IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management","","2001","48","1","107","115","The question, ""what is engineering management?"" has certainly been addressed before in both professional articles and textbooks. However, it seems appropriate to again address this question because of the renewed interest in engineering management. This renewed interest comes in many forms, but two stand out. The first is the increasing trend to give engineering management assignments earlier and earlier in a new engineering graduate's career. The second is the emphasis of engineering management skills in ABET 2000 in the undergraduate engineering program. Both of these initiatives seem to be led by industry and may be a direct result of industry's interest in engineering management skills as a competitive advantage as well as their downsizing practices, which have resulted in the more experienced engineers retiring early and their responsibilities being pushed down to the more junior engineers. If you believe, as does this author, that before you can become a good engineering manager you should first be a good engineer, then the trend of giving management assignments before engineers have had an opportunity to become well grounded in their engineering disciplines should be disturbing. This could eventually affect a company's ability to continue to play a leadership role in introducing new technologies. Hence, the question ""what is engineering management?"" is an important question. This article attempts to answer the question by addressing when engineering management skills are needed in an engineer's career.","1558-0040","","10.1109/17.913170","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=913170","","Engineering","engineering;management","engineering management;engineering graduate;engineering career;ABET 2000;undergraduate engineering program;downsizing practices;competitiveness;process management systems","","31","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown that this problem can be rewritten as a linear program with mixed integer/linear constraints that account for the collision avoidance. A key benefit of this approach is that the path optimization can be readily solved using the CPLEX optimization software with an AMPL/Matlab interface. An example is worked out to show that the framework of mixed integer/linear programming is well suited for path planning and collision avoidance problems. Implementation issues are also considered.

Hutchinson","NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","","2001","17","4","507","515","In image-based visual servo control, where control is effected with respect to the image, there is no direct control over the Cartesian velocities of the robot end effector. As a result, the robot executes trajectories that are desirable in the image, but which can be indirect and seemingly contorted in Cartesian space. We introduce a partitioned approach to visual servo control that overcomes this problem. In particular, we decouple the x-axis rotational and translational components of the control from the remaining degrees of freedom. Then, to guarantee that all features remain in the image throughout the entire trajectory, we incorporate a potential function that repels feature points from the boundary of the image plane. We illustrate our control scheme with a variety of results.","2374-958X","","10.1109/70.954764","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=954764","","Servosystems;Orbital robotics;Servomechanisms;Error correction;Lead;Jacobian matrices;End effectors;Three dimensional displays;Control systems;Robot vision systems","manipulators;position control;motion control;path planning;computer vision","partitioned approach;image-based visual servo control;robot end effector;Cartesian space;rotational components;translational components;potential function;feature points","","306","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Cage induction generators with their brush-less and rigid structure are at present widely used for fixed speed wind systems. To make the cage induction generators widely used also at variable speed systems, proper control strategies should be developed as well as the development or low cost and reliable power electronic devices. At high wind speeds, as is conventional fixed speed system, It is very important to limit the variable speed system to its ratings without mechanical and electrical stresses induced by wind gusts and/or control process. Ibis paper introduces a configuration of variable speed system which includes a pitch controllable horizontal axis wind turbine, a cage Induction generator, a PWM (pulse width modulation) converter and a PWM inverter, the last one being connected to utility grid. Also, the paper proposes and investigates a class of control strategies for limiting the system to its ratings, from the view point of avoiding axial torque and/or generator power fluctuations induced by wind gusts and control errors. The class adopts parallel operation of pitch angle control and electrical power control. The pitch control alms at limiting turbine rotational speed, while generator power control alms at eliminating torque and/or power fluctuations.

A DVR injects a voltage in series with the system voltage and a D-STATCOM injects a current into the system to correct the voltage sag. The steady state performance of both DVR and D-STATCOM is determined and compared for various values of voltage sag, system fault level and load level. The minimum apparent power injection required to correct a given voltage sag by these devices is also determined and compared. The maximum voltage sag that can be corrected without injecting any active power into the system is also determined.

For example, simple rotation, scaling, and/or translation (RST) of an image can prevent blind detection of a public watermark. In this paper, we propose a watermarking algorithm that is robust to RST distortions. The watermark is embedded into a one-dimensional (1-D) signal obtained by taking the Fourier transform of the image, resampling the Fourier magnitudes into log-polar coordinates, and then summing a function of those magnitudes along the log-radius axis. Rotation of the image results in a cyclical shift of the extracted signal. Scaling of the image results in amplification of the extracted signal, and translation of the image has no effect on the extracted signal. We can therefore compensate for rotation with a simple search, and compensate for scaling by using the correlation coefficient as the detection measure. False positive results on a database of 10 000 images are reported. Robustness results on a database of 2000 images are described. It is shown that the watermark is robust to rotation, scale, and translation.

Over the past several years, different algorithms for the detection of full-pixel or subpixel targets with known spectral signature have been developed. The authors take a closer and more in-depth look at the class of subpixel target detection algorithms that explore the linear mixing model (LMM) to characterize the targets and the interfering background. Sensor noise is modeled as a Gaussian random vector with uncorrelated components of equal variance. The paper makes three key contributions. First, it provides a complete and self-contained theoretical derivation of a subpixel target detector using the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) approach and the LMM. Some other widely used algorithms are obtained as byproducts. The performance of the resulting detector, under the postulated model, is discussed in great detail to illustrate the effects of the various operational factors. Second, it introduces a systematic approach to investigate how well the adopted model characterizes the data, and how robust the detection algorithm is to model-data mismatches. Finally, it compares the derived algorithms with regard to two desirable properties: capacity to operate in constant false alarm rate mode and ability to increase the separation between target and background.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.934072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=934072","","Object detection;Hyperspectral sensors;Hyperspectral imaging;Detectors;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Gaussian noise;Vectors;Automatic testing;Robustness;Detection algorithms","geophysical signal processing;geophysical techniques;remote sensing;terrain mapping;image processing;feature extraction;multidimensional signal processing","geophysical measurement technique;land surface;terrain mapping;hyperspectral remote sensing;visible;IR;subpixel target detection;linear mixing model;image processing;feature extraction;multispectral remote sensing;detectability;spectral signature;algorithm","","207","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A biomechanical model of the breast is presented using a finite element (FE) formulation. Emphasis is given to the modeling of breast tissue deformation which takes place in breast imaging procedures. The first step in implementing the FE modeling (FEM) procedure is mesh generation. For objects with irregular and complex geometries such as the breast, this step is one of the most difficult and tedious tasks. For FE mesh generation, two automated methods are presented which process MRI breast images to create a patient-specific mesh. The main components of the breast are adipose, fibroglandular and skin tissues. For modeling the adipose and fibroglandular tissues, we used eight noded hexahedral elements with hyperelastic properties, while for the skin, we chose four noded hyperelastic membrane elements. For model validation, an MR image of an agarose phantom was acquired and corresponding FE meshes were created. Based on assigned elasticity parameters, a numerical experiment was performed using the FE meshes, and good results were obtained. The model was also applied to a breast image registration problem of a volunteer's breast. Although qualitatively reasonable, further work is required to validate the results quantitatively.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.921476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=921476","","Finite element methods;Humans;Magnetic resonance imaging;Breast tissue;Deformable models;Mesh generation;Skin;Medical services;Biomedical equipment;Geometry","biomedical MRI;physiological models;biomechanics;mesh generation;image registration;mammography;biological tissues;edge detection;medical image processing;image segmentation;interpolation;elastic deformation","human breast tissue;deformation modeling;biomechanical 3D finite element modeling;MRI data;mesh generation;automated methods;patient-specific mesh;skin tissues;fibroglandular tissues;adipose tissues;eight noded hexahedral elements;hyperelastic properties;four noded hyperelastic membrane elements;agarose phantom;image registration problem;edge detection;image segmentation;interpolation","Biomechanics;Breast;Breast;Computer Simulation;Elasticity;Female;Finite Element Analysis;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Models, Biological;Phantoms, Imaging;Pressure","145","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, a battery management scheme, which exploits knowledge of the cells' state of charge, is implemented to achieve a further improvement in the battery performance.

With the growing complexity come challenges in testing the correctness of a GUI and its underlying software. We present a new technique to automatically generate test cases for GUIs that exploits planning, a well-developed and used technique in artificial intelligence. Given a set of operators, an initial state, and a goal state, a planner produces a sequence of the operators that will transform the initial state to the goal state. Our test case generation technique enables efficient application of planning by first creating a hierarchical model of a GUI based on its structure. The GUI model consists of hierarchical planning operators representing the possible events in the GUI. The test designer defines the preconditions and effects of the hierarchical operators, which are input into a plan-generation system. The test designer also creates scenarios that represent typical initial and goal states for a GUI user. The planner then generates plans representing sequences of GUI interactions that a user might employ to reach the goal state from the initial state. We implemented our test case generation system, called Planning Assisted Tester for Graphical User Interface Systems (PATHS) and experimentally evaluated its practicality and effectiveness. We describe a prototype implementation of PATHS and report on the results of controlled experiments to generate test cases for Microsoft's WordPad.","1939-3520","","10.1109/32.908959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=908959","","Graphical user interfaces;Automatic testing;Computer aided software engineering;Software testing;System testing;Artificial intelligence;Prototypes;Software measurement;Path planning;Automatic generation control","graphical user interfaces;planning (artificial intelligence);program testing;automatic testing","hierarchical GUI test case generation;automated planning;correctness testing;software;automatic test case generation;artificial intelligence;operators;initial state;goal state;plan-generation system;Planning Assisted Tester for Graphical User Interface Systems;Microsoft WordPad","","154","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the major challenges in devising such networks lies in the constrained energy and computational resources available to sensor nodes. These constraints must be taken into account at all levels of the system hierarchy. The deployment of sensor nodes is the first step in establishing a sensor network. Since sensor networks contain a large number of sensor nodes, the nodes must be deployed in clusters, where the location of each particular node cannot be fully guaranteed a priori. Therefore, the number of nodes that must be deployed in order to completely cover the whole monitored area is often higher than if a deterministic procedure were used. In networks with stochastically placed nodes, activating only the necessary number of sensor nodes at any particular moment can save energy. We introduce a heuristic that selects mutually exclusive sets of sensor nodes, where the members of each of those sets together completely cover the monitored area. The intervals of activity are the same for all sets, and only one of the sets is active at any time. The experimental results demonstrate that by using only a subset of sensor nodes at each moment, we achieve a significant energy savings while fully preserving coverage.","","0-7803-7097-1","10.1109/ICC.2001.936985","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=936985","","Wireless sensor networks;Remote monitoring;Energy consumption;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Computer networks;Circuits;Transceivers;Batteries","sensors;telecommunication networks;set theory","power efficient organization;wireless sensor networks;sensor nodes;stochastically placed nodes;energy savings;physical environment monitoring;set theory","","484","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We look at some specific image based steganography techniques and show that an observer can indeed distinguish between images carrying a hidden message and images which do not carry a message. We derive a closed form expression of the probability of detection and false alarm in terms of the number of bits that are hidden. This leads us to the notion of steganographic capacity, that is, how many bits can we hide in a message without causing statistically significant modifications? Our results are able to provide an upper bound on the this capacity. Our ongoing work relates to adaptive steganographic techniques that take explicit steps to foil the detection mechanisms.

We evaluated the performance of the algorithm by experiments with synthetic datasets as well as a chemical compound dataset. The empirical results show that our algorithm scales linearly with the number of input transactions and it is able to discover frequent subgraphs from a set of graph transactions reasonably fast, even though we have to deal with computationally hard problems such as canonical labeling of graphs and subgraph isomorphism which are not necessary for traditional frequent itemset discovery.","","0-7695-1119-8","10.1109/ICDM.2001.989534","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=989534","","Itemsets;Data mining;Transaction databases;Computer science;Chemical compounds;Labeling;Image databases;Image recognition;Computer vision;Association rules","data mining;visual databases;very large databases;chemistry computing;computational complexity","frequent subgraph discovery;data mining techniques;frequent itemsets;object modeling;data sets;subgraph discovery;computationally efficient algorithm;large graph databases;synthetic datasets;chemical compound dataset;input transactions;graph transactions;computationally hard problems;canonical labeling;subgraph isomorphism","","423","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Experience from more than 200 field measurements was combined with laboratory investigations. Small samples were used in an accelerated aging test to elucidate the correlation between water tree growth and dielectric response. Furthermore, field aged cables were investigated in the laboratory. It has been shown that the dielectric response of water tree deteriorated crosslinked polyethylene (XLPE) cables can be recognized and classified into different types of responses related to the aging status and breakdown strength. The influence of termination and artifacts such as surface currents was investigated. The measurement method enables us to separate the response of the cable from the influence of accessories.

The paper considers a synchronous generator with permanent magnet excitation. Such machines have been employed with several 100 kW and are under consideration in the MW range.","","0-7803-7091-0","10.1109/IEMDC.2001.939422","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=939422","","Permanent magnets;Synchronous generators;Wind energy generation;Magnetic variables control;Mesh generation;Electric variables control;Power generation;Wind energy;Circuits;Wind turbines","variable speed gear;wind turbines;permanent magnet generators;synchronous generators;machine control;angular velocity control;losses;commutation;invertors","permanent magnet synchronous generator control;variable speed wind energy system;stall controlled wind energy converter;variable speed mode;self-commutated converter;intermediate voltage circuit;wind turbine speed control;generator side inverter;optimal working point;losses minimisation","","48","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the commutation problem and complicated PWM method keep it from being utilized in industry. This paper discloses a novel matrix topology with advantages over the usual matrix converter topology. Firstly, it has the same performance as a conventional matrix converter in terms of voltage transfer ratio capacity, four quadrant operation, unity input power factor, no DC capacitor and pure sine waveforms with only high order harmonics in both line and load side. Secondly, the PWM method utilized for the conventional inverter can be used, which can largely simplify its control complexity. Thirdly, all the switches at the line side turn on and turn off at zero current; the converter does not have any commutation problems as required by the conventional matrix converter.

They achieve statistical power reduction by eliminating redundant transitions of internal nodes. These flip-flops also have negative setup time and thus provide small data-to-output latency and attribute of soft-clock edge for overcoming clock skew-related cycle time loss. The simulation comparison indicates that the proposed differential flip-flop achieves power savings of up to 61% with no impact on latency while the single-ended structure provides the maximum power savings of around 67%, as compared to conventional flip-flops. With a typical switching activity of 0.33, the power consumption is reduced by as much as 23-30% with comparable minimum data-to-output latency. It is also indicated that the proposed single-ended structure provides power comparable to the fully static master-slave design with significantly reduced data-to-output latency. An eight-bit counter was fabricated using a 0.35-/spl mu/m CMOS technology, and the experimental results indicate that the counter using the differential CCFF saves the overall power consumption by about 30% as compared to that using the conventional flip-flop.","1558-173X","","10.1109/4.938376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=938376","","Flip-flops;Clocks;Delay;Energy consumption;Latches;Digital systems;Timing;Frequency;Logic;Counting circuits","flip-flops;CMOS logic circuits;low-power electronics","conditional-capture flip-flop;statistical power reduction;low-power flip-flops;redundant transitions elimination;internal nodes;negative setup time;small data-to-output latency;soft-clock edge attribute;clock skew-related cycle time loss;differential flip-flop;single-ended structure;CMOS technology;master-slave latches","","79","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It seems rational to put all your engineers in one place, encourage them to share objectives, and let the project run. Why use distributed sites when it's easier to work in one location without the overhead of remote communication and planning? How is it possible to survive (and succeed with) globally dispersed projects? Working in a global context has its advantages, but it also has drawbacks. On the plus side, you gain time-zone effectiveness and reduced cost in various countries. However, working on a globally distributed project means operating costs for planning and managing people, along with language and cultural barriers. It also creates jealousy as the more expensive engineers (who are afraid of losing their jobs) are forced to train their much cheaper counterparts. In this case study, we try to summarize experiences and share best practices from projects of different types and sizes that involve several locations on different continents and in many cultures.","1937-4194","","10.1109/52.914748","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=914748","","Programming;Costs;Research and development;Product development;Productivity;ISO standards;Coordinate measuring machines;Best practices;Teamwork;Europe","software development management","global software development;distributed sites;remote communication;globally dispersed projects","","173","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The DLL provides multiple clock phases that are combined to produce the desired output frequency for the synthesizer, and provides temperature-compensated biasing for the tunable oscillator.

Using an ideal circuit model without parasitic circuit elements, we have derived the determining condition of frequency independence of circuit elements. Extending the concept, we can also obtain a broad-band phase shifter for other phase difference as well. In this case, for a given phase difference and an operating frequency, we also derive a condition to obtain minimum variation of phase difference around the operating frequency. This enables the broad-band characteristics for arbitrary phase difference.

Self-assembly is accomplished using photolithographically defined part and substrate binding sites that are complementary shapes of hydrophobic self-assembled monolayers. The patterned substrate is passed through a film of hydrophobic adhesive on water, causing the adhesive to selectively coat the binding sites. Next, the microscopic parts, fabricated from silicon-on-insulator wafers and ranging in size from 150/spl times/150/spl times/15 /spl mu/m/sup 3/ to 400/spl times/400/spl times/50 /spl mu/m/sup 3/, are directed toward the substrate surface under water using a pipette. Once the hydrophobic pattern on a part comes into contact with an adhesive-coated substrate binding site, shape matching occurs spontaneously due to interfacial free energy minimization. In water, capillary forces of the adhesive hold the parts in place with an alignment precision of less than 0.2 /spl mu/m.

Image quality is measured objectively, using peak signal-to-noise ratio or picture quality scale, and subjectively, using perceived image quality. The effects of different wavelet functions, image contents and compression ratios are assessed. A comparison with a discrete-cosine-transform-based compression system is given.

A decomposition theorem is applied to both images to obtain 64 initial clusters based on their scattering characteristics. The data sets are then classified by an iterative algorithm based on a complex Wishart density function of the 6/spl times/6 matrix. A class number reduction technique is then applied on the 64 resulting clusters to improve the efficiency of the interpretation and representation of each class.

Quasi-elliptic response filters are very popular in communication systems because of their high selectivity, which is introduced by a pair of transmission zeros. A number of ways of implementing the quasi-elliptic response filter on microstrip have been studied over the last two decades, i.e., the cascaded quadruplet filter, canonical filter, and extracted-pole filter. However, there is very little information in the literature giving the design details for microstrip extracted-pole filters. In this paper, design equations of the extracted-pole filter for microstrip are reviewed. A new class of microstrip filter is also presented here. This class of filter will have a quasi-elliptic function response and at the same time linear phase in the passband. The linear phase of the filter is introduced by an in-phase cross coupling, while the transmission zero is realized using an extracted-pole technique. Experimental results, together with a theoretical comparison between the group delay of this design, and the conventional quasi-elliptic six-pole filter are also presented.","1557-9670","","10.1109/22.903092","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=903092","","Microstrip filters;Nonlinear filters;Data mining;Filtering theory;Wireless communication;Communication systems;Information filtering;Information filters;Equations;Passband","poles and zeros;microstrip filters;elliptic filters;linear phase filters","design;microstrip six-pole quasi-elliptic filter;linear phase response;extracted-pole technique;wireless communication system;transmission zero;in-phase cross coupling","","45","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The authors propose a novel template-matching technique based on a genetic algorithm (GA) template matching (GATM) for detecting nodules existing within the lung area; the GA was used to determine the target position in the observed image efficiently and to select an adequate template image from several reference patterns for quick template matching. In addition, a conventional template matching was employed to detect nodules existing on the lung wall area, lung wall template matching (LWTM), where semicircular models were used as reference patterns; the semicircular models were rotated according to the angle of the target point on the contour of the lung wall. After initial detecting candidates using the two template-matching methods, the authors extracted a total of 13 feature values and used them to eliminate false-positive findings. Twenty clinical cases involving a total of 557 sectional images were used in this study. 71 nodules out of 98 were correctly detected by the authors' scheme (i.e., a detection rate of about 72%), with the number of false positives at approximately 1.1/sectional image.

Ultimately, we want a coverage path that minimizes some cost such as time. We take the approach of decomposing the coverage region into subregions, selecting a sequence of those subregions, and then generating a path that covers each subregion in turn. We focus on generating decompositions based upon the planar line sweep. After a general overview of the coverage problem, we describe how our assumptions lead to the optimality criterion of minimizing the sum of subregion altitudes (which are measured relative to the sweep direction assigned to that subregion). For a line-sweep decomposition, the sweep direction is the same for all subregions. We describe how to find the optimal sweep direction for convex polygonal worlds. We then introduce the minimal sum of altitudes (MSA) decomposition in which we may assign a different sweep direction to each subregion. This decomposition is better for generating an optimal coverage path. We describe a method based on multiple line sweeps and dynamic programming to generate the MSA decomposition.","1050-4729","0-7803-6576-3","10.1109/ROBOT.2001.932525","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=932525","","Robot sensing systems;Costs;Service robots;Landmine detection;Snow;Computer science;Inspection;Actuators;Spraying;Coatings","dynamic programming;path planning;minimisation;graph theory;mobile robots","optimal line-sweep-based decompositions;coverage algorithms;robotic coverage;coverage path;planar line sweep;optimality criterion;optimal sweep direction;convex polygonal worlds","","104","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The HMT is a tree-structured probabilistic graph that captures the statistical properties of the coefficients of the wavelet transform. Since the HMT is particularly well suited to images containing singularities (edges and ridges), it provides a good classifier for distinguishing between textures. Utilizing the inherent tree structure of the wavelet HMT and its fast training and likelihood computation algorithms, we perform texture classification at a range of different scales. We then fuse these multiscale classifications using a Bayesian probabilistic graph to obtain reliable final segmentations. Since HMTseg works on the wavelet transform of the image, it can directly segment wavelet-compressed images without the need for decompression into the space domain. We demonstrate the performance of HMTseg with synthetic, aerial photo, and document image segmentations.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.941855","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=941855","","Image segmentation;Hidden Markov models;Tree graphs;Wavelet transforms;Wavelet domain;Image texture;Tree data structures;Classification tree analysis;Fuses;Bayesian methods","image segmentation;image texture;wavelet transforms;image coding;transform coding;image classification;hidden Markov models;remote sensing;document image processing;trees (mathematics);Bayes methods","multiscale image segmentation;wavelet-domain hidden Markov models;image texture segmentation algorithm;HMTseg;hidden Markov tree;HMT;tree-structured probabilistic graph;statistical properties;wavelet transform;singularities;edges;ridges;textures;multiscale classifications;Bayesian probabilistic graph;wavelet-compressed images;aerial photographs;document images","","241","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

ICCV 2001","","2001","1","","362","369 vol.1","Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been widely used for the representation of shape, appearance and motion. One drawback of typical PCA methods is that they are least squares estimation techniques and hence fail to account for ""outliers"" which are common in realistic training sets. In computer vision applications, outliers typically occur within a sample (image) due to pixels that are corrupted by noise, alignment errors, or occlusion. We review previous approaches for making PCA robust to outliers and present a new method that uses an intra-sample outlier process to account for pixel outliers. We develop the theory of Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and describe a robust M-estimation algorithm for learning linear multi-variate representations of high dimensional data such as images. Quantitative comparisons with traditional PCA and previous robust algorithms illustrate the benefits of RPCA when outliers are present. Details of the algorithm are described and a software implementation is being made publically available.","","0-7695-1143-0","10.1109/ICCV.2001.937541","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=937541","","Principal component analysis;Computer vision;Noise robustness;Shape;Motion analysis;Least squares approximation;Application software;Pixel;Multi-stage noise shaping;Computer errors","principal component analysis;computer vision;least squares approximations","principal component analysis;computer vision;outliers;robust M-estimation algorithm;least squares estimation","","154","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A model is established for the wind farm Hagesholm (Denmark). This wind farm consists of six active stall controlled wind turbines from NEG-Micon with 2 MW rated power. The wind turbines are connected through two feeders to the 10kV busbar in a 50/10kV substation. The simulation model, implemented in the dedicated power system simulation tool DIgSILENT, is used in the first place to simulate the behaviour of the wind farm during normal operation of the wind farm. The model comprises a grid model, six almost identical wind turbine models, where electric, mechanic and aerodynamic aspects are included, and a model for the wind speed. The described model can be used for assessment of power quality, control strategies and behaviour in the event of grid faults. In this paper, the ability of the model to predict power quality is investigated. The simulations are used to compute power quality characteristics of a wind turbine, i.e. maximum power, reactive power consumption and flicker emission. The applied computation methods are reflecting the international power quality standards of wind turbine IEC 61400-21.

In other words, the authors discuss about an implementation method of tabu search to find how much distribution loss can be reduced if DGs are optimally allocated at the demand side of a power system.

Fundamental limits are derived from the basic axioms of electromagnetic, communication, and thermodynamic theories, which immutably restrict interconnect performance, energy dissipation, and noise reduction. At the material level, the conductor resistivity increases substantially in sub-50-nm technology due to scattering mechanisms that are controlled by quantum mechanical phenomena and structural/morphological effects. At the device and circuit level, interconnect scaling significantly increases interconnect crosstalk and latency. Reverse scaling of global interconnects causes inductance to influence on-chip interconnect transients such that even with ideal return paths, mutual inductance increases crosstalk by up to 60% over that predicted by conventional RC models. At the system level, the number of metal levels explodes for highly connected 2-D logic megacells that double in size every two years such that by 2014 the number is significantly larger than ITRS projections. This result emphasizes that changes in design, technology, and architecture are needed to cope with the onslaught of wiring demands. One potential solution is 3-D integration of transistors, which is expected to significantly improve interconnect performance. Increasing the number of active layers, including the use of separate layers for repeaters, and optimizing the wiring network, yields an improvement in interconnect performance of up to 145% at the 50-nm node.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.915376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=915376","","Integrated circuit interconnections;Conducting materials;Crosstalk;Inductance;Wiring;Thermodynamics;Energy dissipation;Noise reduction;Conductivity;Electromagnetic scattering","ULSI;integrated circuit interconnections;crosstalk;integrated circuit noise;delays;inductance;capacitance","interconnect limits;gigascale integration;GSI;physical limits;conductor resistivity;energy dissipation;noise reduction;interconnect performance;scattering mechanisms;quantum mechanical phenomena;interconnect scaling;interconnect crosstalk;interconnect latency;global interconnects;mutual inductance;onchip interconnect transients;metal levels;3D integration;material limits","","349","","52","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The problem can be modeled in detail for a hydro system that contains both conventional and pumped-storage units. Discrete and dynamic constraints such as unit startup/shutdown and minimum-up/minimum-down time limits are also included in the model for hydro unit commitment (HUC). The STHS problem is solved with a state-of-the-art package which includes an algebraic modeling language and a MILP solver. The usefulness of the proposed solution algorithm is illustrated by testing the problem with actual hydraulic system data. Numerical experiences show that the solution technique is computationally efficient, simple, and suitable for decision support of short-term hydro operations planning.

In order to focus on the passengers on the platform, background subtraction and update techniques are used. In addition, due to the high variation of brightness on the platforms, a variance filter is introduced to optimize the removal of background pixels.

The converter requires two switches, but only one set of controls. As compared to a cascaded buck converter/boost converter topology, the noninverting buck-boost converter requires one less capacitor and inductor. The system operates as a buck converter for duty cycles between 0-50% in the microcontroller, and as a boost converter (up to a gain of twice the input voltage) for duty cycles between 50-100%. The system is therefore also advantageous because the microcontroller algorithm prevents a dead short from occurring during operation in the boost converter mode. Experimental and PSpice results prove that both buck and boost operation are possible using this topology. The effect of the load resistance on the results is discussed.","","0-7803-6748-0","10.1109/SECON.2001.923091","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=923091","","Microcontrollers;Switching converters;Switches;Equations;Inductors;Capacitors;Buck converters;Voltage control;Circuit topology;Power electronics","DC-DC power convertors;switching circuits;microcontrollers;SPICE;voltage control","noninverting buck-boost converter;microcontroller implementation;component count reduction;capacitor;inductor;duty cycles;microcontroller algorithm;PSpice;load resistance effects","","12","","3","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the case of strip fin, and pin fin heat sinks, both in-line and staggered arrays have been studied. The pin fin heat sinks had circular and square cross-sections. For each type, tests were run with fin heights (H) of 10, 15, and 20 mm while the heat sink width (B) was kept constant and equal to 52.8 mm. In total, 42 different heat sinks were tested. The width of the wind tunnel duct (CB) was varied in such a way that results were obtained for B/CB=0.84, 0.53, and 0.33. The wind tunnel height (CH) was varied similarly, and data were recorded for H/CH=1, 0.67, and 0.33 while the duct Reynolds number was varied between 2000 through 16500. An empirical bypass correlation has been developed for the different fin designs. The correlation predicts the Nusselt number and the dimensionless pressure drop and takes into account the influence of duct height, duct width, fin height, fin thickness, and fin-to-fin distance. The correlation parameters are individual for each fin design. Further, a physical bypass model for plate fin heat sinks has been developed to describe the bypass effect.","1557-9972","","10.1109/6144.926376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=926376","","Strips;Heat sinks;Ducts;Testing;Thermal resistance;Computational fluid dynamics;Thermal conductivity;Resistance heating;Helium;Thermomechanical processes","heat sinks;thermal resistance;wind tunnels;electronic equipment testing;packaging","hydraulic performance;thermal performance;plate fin heat sinks;strip fin heat sinks;pin fin heat sinks;flow bypass;wind tunnel;staggered arrays;in-line arrays;fin heights;heat sink width (;duct Reynolds number;empirical bypass correlation;fin designs;Nusselt number;dimensionless pressure drop;duct height;duct width;fin height;fin thickness;fin-to-fin distance;correlation parameters;physical bypass model;10 to 20 mm;52.8 mm","","82","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For an exemplary class of stochastic strict-feedback systems with vanishing nonlinearities, where the equilibrium is preserved in the presence of noise, we develop an adaptive stabilization scheme (based on tuning functions) that requires no a priori knowledge of a bound on the covariance. Next, we introduce a control Lyapunov function formula for stochastic disturbance attenuation. Finally, we address optimality and solve a differential game problem with the control and the noise covariance as opposing players; for strict-feedback systems the resulting Isaacs equation has a closed-form solution.","1558-2523","","10.1109/9.940927","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=940927","","Stochastic systems;Stochastic resonance;Nonlinear systems;Attenuation;Lyapunov method;Optimal control;Backstepping;Stability;Robustness;Stochastic processes","nonlinear systems;stochastic systems;stability;Lyapunov methods;feedback;noise;adaptive control;differential games;optimisation","stochastic systems;nonlinear systems;disturbance attenuation;stabilization;Lyapunov function;strict-feedback systems;adaptive control;differential game;stability;backstepping;optimisation","","447","","48","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Su","Geneva Univ., Switzerland; NA; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Communications Magazine","","2001","39","8","118","126","Watermarking is a potential method for protection of ownership rights on digital audio, image, and video data. Benchmarks are used to evaluate the performance of different watermarking algorithms. For image watermarking, the Stirmark package is the most popular benchmark, and the best current algorithms perform well against it. However, results obtained by the Stirmark benchmark have to be handled carefully since Stirmark does not properly model the watermarking process and consequently is limited in its potential for impairing sophisticated image watermarking schemes. In this context, the goal of this article is threefold. First, we give an overview of the current attacking methods. Second, we describe attacks exploiting knowledge about the statistics of the original data and the embedded watermark. We propose a stochastic formulation of estimation-based attacks. Such attacks consist of two main stages: watermark estimation, exploitation of the estimated watermark to trick watermark detection or create ownership ambiguity. The full strength of estimation-based attacks can be achieved by introducing additional noise, where the attacker tries to combine the estimated watermark and the additive noise to impair watermark communication as much as possible while fulfilling a quality constraint on the attacked data. With a sophisticated quality constraint it is also possible to exploit human perception: the human auditory system in case of audio watermarks and the human visual system in case of image and video watermarks. Third, we discuss the current status of image watermarking benchmarks. We present Petitcolas'(see Electronic Imaging '99: Security and Watermarking of Multimedia Content, SPIE Proc., vol.3657, San Jose, CA, 1999) Stirmark benchmarking tool. Next, we consider the benchmark proposed by the University of Geneva Vision Group that contains more deliberate attacks. Finally, we summarize the current work of the European Certimark project, whose goal is to accelerate efforts from a number of research groups and companies in order to produce an improved ensemble of benchmarking tools.","1558-1896","","10.1109/35.940053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=940053","","Watermarking;Humans;Additive noise;Protection;Packaging;Statistics;Stochastic resonance;Auditory system;Visual system;Security","copy protection;security of data;audio coding;video coding;image coding;data compression;stochastic processes;noise;copyright;visual perception","digital watermarks;estimation based attacks;University of Geneva;classification;ownership rights protection;digital audio;Stirmark package;video data;performance evaluation;watermarking algorithms;European Certimark project;attacking methods;data statistics;embedded watermark;stochastic formulation;watermark estimation;estimated watermark;watermark detection;ownership ambiguity;additive noise;watermark communication;quality constraint;attacked data;human perception;human auditory system;audio watermarks;benchmarking tools;video watermarks;image watermarking benchmarks","","172","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The second technique has a semiparametric nature and imposes a local structure on the data to extract reliable scale information. The local scale of the underlying density is taken as the bandwidth which maximizes the magnitude of the normalized mean shift vector.

Various converter topologies have been compared in this paper. Among these converter topologies, the adjustable frequency PWM inverter is the best choice for single-phase induction motor drives. However, adjustable-frequency drives have not been widely used with single-phase induction motors. The open-loop constant V/f control law cannot be used with the single-phase induction motor drives as it is used with three phase motors. The variation of the operating frequency at lower speed range with constant load torque causes variation in the motor's slip. A constant V/f control is suitable only over the upper speed range. However, improvements in the low frequency performance require the use of constant power dissipation in the motor.

Nuseibeh","Open Univ., Milton Keynes, UK","Computer","","2001","34","3","115","119","Software development organizations often choose between alternative starting points-requirements or architectures. This invariably results in a waterfall development process that produces artificially frozen requirements documents for use in the next step in the development life cycle. Alternatively, this process creates systems with constrained architectures that restrict users and handicap developers by resisting inevitable and desirable changes in requirements. The spiral life-cycle model addresses many drawbacks of a waterfall model by providing an incremental development process, in which developers repeatedly evaluate changing project risks to manage unstable requirements and funding. An even finer-grain spiral life cycle reflects both the realities and necessities of modern software development. Such a life cycle acknowledges the need to develop software architectures that are stable, yet adaptable, in the presence of changing requirements. The cornerstone of this process is that developers craft a system's requirements and its architecture concurrently, and interleave their development.","1558-0814","","10.1109/2.910904","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910904","","Weaving;Computer architecture;Software systems;Software architecture;Buildings;Software development management;Software maintenance;Software design;Pattern analysis;Reverse engineering","software architecture;formal specification;systems analysis","software development organizations;requirements;architectures;spiral life-cycle model;waterfall model;incremental development process;changing project risk evaluation","","110","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

However, the thermomechanical behavior of SMA actuators is too complicated to accurately predict their response. Moreover the tracking control accuracy of SMA actuators is limited due to the inherent hysteresis nonlinearity. The paper presents a model of an SMA actuator for use in mechanical design and a control system for compensating the hysteresis. First, the model based on constitutive laws developed by Brinson et al. (1996) and our proposed hysteresis model is demonstrated. Next, we propose a control system composed of a proportional integral derivative (PID) feedback loop and a feedforward loop. In the feedforward loop, the desired control input corresponding to the desired displacement is obtained from a static SMA model derived by modifying the classic Preisach hysteresis model. We also propose a method for identifying parameters of the hysteresis model. This methods demands only measurement of the major loop. Application of the control system to our developed SMA actuator shows that the tracking control performance is improved.","1558-0865","","10.1109/87.896745","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896745","","Shape memory alloys;Actuators;Control system synthesis;Shape control;Hysteresis;Control systems;Thermomechanical processes;PD control;Pi control;Proportional control","intelligent actuators;shape memory effects;hysteresis;control nonlinearities;feedback;feedforward;tracking;three-term control;microactuators","shape memory alloy actuator;tracking control system;thermomechanical behavior;hysteresis nonlinearity;mechanical design;proportional integral derivative feedback loop;feedforward loop;Preisach hysteresis model","","144","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, we let a set of deformable contours define the boundaries between regions in an image where we model the data via piecewise smooth functions and employ a gradient flow to evolve these contours. Each gradient step involves solving an optimal estimation problem for the data within each region, connecting curve evolution and the Mumford-Shah functional with the theory of boundary-value stochastic processes. The resulting active contour model offers a tractable implementation of the original Mumford-Shah model (i.e., without resorting to elliptic approximations which have traditionally been favored for greater ease in implementation) to simultaneously segment and smoothly reconstruct the data within a given image in a coupled manner. Various implementations of this algorithm are introduced to increase its speed of convergence. We also outline a hierarchical implementation of this algorithm to handle important image features such as triple points and other multiple junctions. Next, by generalizing the data fidelity term of the original Mumford-Shah functional to incorporate a spatially varying penalty, we extend our method to problems in which data quality varies across the image and to images in which sets of pixel measurements are missing. This more general model leads us to a novel PDE-based approach for simultaneous image magnification, segmentation, and smoothing, thereby extending the traditional applications of the Mumford-Shah functional which only considers simultaneous segmentation and smoothing.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.935033","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=935033","","Image segmentation;Noise reduction;Smoothing methods;Active contours;Interpolation;Stochastic processes;Image reconstruction;Application software;Computer vision;Image processing","image segmentation;interpolation;stochastic processes;functional equations;smoothing methods;gradient methods;image reconstruction;partial differential equations","curve evolution;Mumford-Shah functional;image segmentation;image denoising;image interpolation;image magnification;image smoothing;deformable contours;image region boundaries;piecewise smooth functions;gradient flow;optimal estimation problem;boundary-value stochastic process;tractable implementation;Mumford-Shah model;data reconstruction;algorithm implementations;image features;triple points;multiple junctions;data fidelity term;spatially varying penalty;data quality;pixel measurements;PDE-based approach;partial differential equations","","559","","52","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many enabling technologies including wideband code-division multiple access, software-defined radio, intelligent antennas, and digital processing devices are greatly improving the spectral efficiency of third-generation systems. In the mobile network area, the trend is to move from traditional circuit-switched systems to packet-switched programmable networks that integrate both voice and packet services, and eventually evolve toward an all-IP network.

Unlike the traditional ""passive"" metal interconnect, the ""active"" RF/wireless interconnect is based on low loss and dispersion-free microwave signal transmission, near-field capacitive coupling, and modem multiple-access algorithms. In this paper we address issues relevant to the signal channeling of the RF/wireless interconnect and discuss its advantages in speed, signal integrity, and channel reconfiguration.

In this paper, we review the prior and current work in this field, and then describe our efforts to develop and extend the bandwidth of a linearized sampling technique referred to as phase-encoded optical sampling. The technique uses a dual-output electrooptic sampling transducer to achieve both high linearity and 60-dB suppression of laser amplitude noise. The bandwidth of the technique is extended by optically distributing the post-sampling pulses to an array of time-interleaved electronic quantizers. We report on the performance of a 505-MS/s (megasample per second) optically sampled ADC that includes high-extinction LiNbO/sub 3/ 1-to-8 optical time-division demultiplexers. Initial characterization of the 505-MS/s system reveals a maximum signal-to-noise ratio of 51 dB (8.2 bits) and a spur-free dynamic range of 61 dB. The performance of the present system is limited by electronic quantizer noise, photodiode saturation, and preliminary calibration procedures. None of these fundamentally limit this sampling approach, which should enable multigigahertz converters with 12-b resolution. A signal-to-noise analysis of the phase-encoded sampling technique shows good agreement with measured data from the 505-MS/s system.","1557-9670","","10.1109/22.954797","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=954797","","Analog-digital conversion;Optical saturation;Sampling methods;Optical noise;Bandwidth;Optical arrays;Quantization;Transducers;Linearity;Laser noise","analogue-digital conversion;quantisation (signal);demultiplexing equipment;timing jitter;calibration","optically sampled analog-to-digital converters;electronic quantization;bandwidth;linearized sampling technique;phase-encoded optical sampling;dual-output electrooptic sampling transducer;laser amplitude noise;time-interleaved electronic quantizers;time-division demultiplexers;signal-to-noise ratio;spur-free dynamic range;photodiode saturation;preliminary calibration procedures;sampling approach;12 bit;LiNbO/sub 3/","","222","","53","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A fully controlled rectifier and an induction motor drive system are presented as typical applications to illustrate the use of many techniques for controlling power converters. The paper then points out how a wide variety of control techniques can be applied to enhance the controller performance and bandwidth in power electronics.

The MPC has received much attention as a powerful tool for the control of industrial process systems. An MPC-based PID controller can be derived from the second-order linear model of a process. The steam generator is usually described by the well-known fourth-order linear model, which consists of the mass capacity, reverse dynamics, and mechanical oscillation terms. However the important terms in this linear model are the mass capacity and reverse dynamics terms, both of which can be described by a second-order linear system. The proposed auto-tuned PID controller was applied to a linear model of steam generators. The parameters of a linear model for steam generators are very different according to the power levels. The PID gains of the proposed controller are tuned automatically. Also, the proposed controller showed fast water level tracking and small shrink and swell performance by changing only the input-weighting factor according to the power level for the water-level deviation and sudden steam flow disturbances supposed to investigate the tracking performance and swell and shrink characteristics.","1558-1578","","10.1109/23.960354","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=960354","","Three-term control;Predictive models;Predictive control;Power system modeling;Automatic control;Pi control;Proportional control;Process control;Control systems;Electrical equipment industry","predictive control;nuclear reactor steam generators;three-term control;power station control","automatic tuning;proportional-integral-derivative control;predictive control;steam generator water level;mass capacity;reverse dynamics;auto-tuned;linear model;power level;gain;input-weighting factor;nuclear steam generator","","64","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on the analysis of a major disturbance in a grid system, interconnection or distributed generation system, the load shedding is formulated as an optimization problem subject to system, operation and security constraints. To handle the differential equations that represent the dynamics of different types of generators, a discretization technique is used to transfer differential equations into algebraic equations. The final nonlinear optimization problem is then solved by mathematical programming. The method is first tested on a small system.

This gives a set of bases which not only allows a non-subtractive (part-based) representation of images but also manifests localized features.

First, general CRB expressions are derived for a narrowband signal and array model and a space-time separable noise model that allows both spatial and temporal correlation. We discuss the relationship between the CRB and ambiguity function for this model. Then, we specialize our CRB results to the case of temporally white noise and the practically important signal shape of a linear frequency modulated (chirp) pulse sequence. We compute the CRB for a three-dimensional (3-D) array with isotropic sensors in spatially white noise and show that it is a function of the array geometry only through the ""moments of inertia"" of the array. The volume of the confidence region for the target's location is proposed as a measure of accuracy. For this measure, we show that the highest (and lowest) target location accuracy is achieved if the target lies along one of the principal axes of inertia of the array. Finally, we compare the location accuracies of several array geometries.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.923295","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=923295","","Sensor arrays;White noise;Chirp modulation;Pulse modulation;Delay effects;Doppler shift;Doppler radar;Sonar;Narrowband;Noise shaping","array signal processing;radar signal processing;sonar signal processing;direction-of-arrival estimation;white noise;chirp modulation;FM radar;Doppler shift;delay estimation;sequences","Cramer-Rao bounds;active sonar array;active radar array;range estimation;velocity estimation;direction estimation;Cramer-Rao bound expressions;point target;general CRB expressions;array model;narrowband signal;space-time separable noise model;spatial correlation;temporal correlation;ambiguity function;temporally white noise;signal shape;linear frequency modulated pulse sequence;chirp pulse sequence;3D array;isotropic sensors;spatially white noise;array geometry;moments of inertia;confidence region volume;accuracy measure;target location accuracy;DOA estimation;time delay estimation;Doppler shift estimation","","111","","39","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Earlier control results deal with the two problems separately, or employ a switching strategy of two different kinds of controllers, which causes a discontinuity of system behavior. We design in this paper a global controller to coordinate the transient stabilizer and voltage regulator. The designed controller is smooth and robust with respect to different transient faults.

We derive a reweighted interacting multiple model algorithm. Although the IMM algorithm is an approximation of the conditional mean state estimator, our algorithm is a recursive implementation of a maximum a posteriori (MAP) state sequence estimator.

The point cloud is sampled from the boundary surface of a mechanical component with arbitrary shape. The proposed approach is composed of three steps. In the first step, a mesh surface domain is reconstructed to establish an explicit topological relation among the discrete points. The topological adjacency is further optimized to recover the second order object geometry. In the second step, curvature-based border detection is applied on the irregular mesh to extract both sharp borders with tangent discontinuity and smooth borders with curvature discontinuity. Finally, the mesh patches separated by the extracted borders are grouped together in the third step. For objects with complex shape, a multilevel segmentation scheme is proposed for better results. The capability of the proposed approach is demonstrated using various point clouds having distinct characteristics. Integrated with state of art scanning devices, the developed segmentation scheme can support reverse engineering of high precision mechanical components. It has potential applications in a whole spectrum of engineering problems with a major impact on rapid design and prototyping, shape analysis, and virtual reality.","2374-958X","","10.1109/70.938384","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=938384","","Feature extraction;Clouds;Shape;Surface reconstruction;Data mining;Geometry;Art;Reverse engineering;Design engineering;Virtual prototyping","feature extraction;reverse engineering;mechanical engineering;topology;geometry;edge detection;image segmentation","automatic data segmentation;geometric feature extraction;unorganized 3D coordinate points;systematic approach;geometric surface features;point cloud;boundary surface;mechanical component;mesh surface domain;explicit topological relation;discrete points;topological adjacency;second order object geometry;curvature-based border detection;irregular mesh;sharp borders;tangent discontinuity;smooth borders;curvature discontinuity;mesh patches;multilevel segmentation scheme;state of art scanning devices;reverse engineering;high precision mechanical component;rapid design;rapid prototyping;shape analysis;virtual reality","","71","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The hidden Markov tree (HMT) model captures the key features of the joint probability density of the wavelet coefficients of real-world data. One potential drawback to the HMT framework is the need for computationally expensive iterative training to fit an HMT model to a given data set (e.g., using the expectation-maximization algorithm). We greatly simplify the HMT model by exploiting the inherent self-similarity of real-world images. The simplified model specifies the HMT parameters with just nine meta-parameters (independent of the size of the image and the number of wavelet scales). We also introduce a Bayesian universal HMT (uHMT) that fixes these nine parameters. The uHMT requires no training of any kind, while extremely simple, we show using a series of image estimation/denoising experiments that these new models retain nearly all of the key image structure modeled by the full HMT. Finally, we propose a fast shift-invariant HMT estimation algorithm that outperforms other wavelet-based estimators in the current literature, both visually and in mean square error.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.931100","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=931100","","Hidden Markov models;Bayesian methods;Wavelet transforms;Image edge detection;Image processing;Wavelet coefficients;Markov random fields;Image resolution;Signal processing;Probability","Bayes methods;trees (mathematics);hidden Markov models;wavelet transforms;probability;parameter estimation;image processing","Bayesian tree-structured image modeling;wavelet-domain hidden Markov models;wavelet-domain HMM;statistical signal processing;statistical image processing;hidden Markov tree model;joint probability density;wavelet coefficients;computationally expensive iterative training;expectation-maximization algorithm;simplified HMT model;self-similarity;real-world images;HMT parameters;meta-parameters;Bayesian universal HMT;image estimation;image denoising;image structure;fast shift-invariant HMT estimation algorithm;mean square error;wavelet-based estimators","","318","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The procedure is tested with historical 6.6 GHz H and V polarized brightness temperature observations from the scanning multichannel microwave radiometer (SMMR) over several test sites in Illinois. Results using only nighttime data are presented at this time due to the greater stability of nighttime surface temperature estimation. The methodology uses a radiative transfer model to solve for surface soil moisture and vegetation optical depth simultaneously using a nonlinear iterative optimization procedure. It assumes known constant values for the scattering albedo and roughness, and that vegetation optical depth for H-polarization is the same as for V-polarization.

The approach relies on a frequency domain modeling of system dynamics using positive sequence and negative sequence dynamic components. Following the passivity-based procedure, a family of controllers is obtained whose objective is to deal with unbalanced supply voltages, and to perform regulation of AC unbalanced currents. The proposed solution is relevant for high-power VSI inverters. The new controllers include adaptive refinements to cope with parameter uncertainties, and stability and convergence proofs are outlined in all cases. Finally, a series of simplifications and adjustments were explored to reduce the adaptive controllers to PI structures in stationary frame coordinates. The simplified controllers are in a form suitable for implementation, and establish a downward compatibility with standard industrial practice.","1558-0865","","10.1109/87.944467","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=944467","","Reactive power;Automatic voltage control;Voltage control;Inverters;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Reactive power control;Frequency domain analysis;Power system modeling;Uncertain systems","invertors;reactive power control;static VAr compensators;active filters;adaptive control;nonlinear systems;two-term control","dissipativity;voltage-sourced inverters;reactive power control;imbalance compensation;static synchronous compensator;STATCOM;adaptive control;PI control;active filter;nonlinear systems","","39","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a distributed clustering algorithm, MOBIC, based on the use of this mobility metric for selection of clusterheads, and demonstrate that it leads to more stable cluster formation than the ""least clusterhead change"" version of the well known Lowest-ID clustering algorithm (Chiang et al., 1997). We show reduction of as much as 33% in the rate of clusterhead changes owing to the use of the proposed technique. In a MANET that uses scalable cluster-based services, network performance metrics such as throughput and delay are tightly coupled with the frequency of cluster reorganization. Therefore, we believe that using MOBIC can result in a more stable configuration, and thus yield better performance.","","0-7695-1080-9","10.1109/CDCS.2001.918738","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=918738","","Intelligent networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Clustering algorithms;Mobile communication;Routing protocols;Bandwidth;Measurement;Throughput;Frequency;Base stations","mobile communication;distributed algorithms;performance evaluation;wireless LAN","mobility based metric;MOBIC;mobile ad hoc networks;MANET;distributed clustering algorithm;selection of clusterheads;Lowest-ID clustering algorithm;scalable cluster-based services;network performance metrics","","288","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the case of a periodically switched transistor, measured 1/f noise power spectral density (psd) was shown to be significantly lower than the estimate using the standard 1/f noise model. For a ring oscillator, measured 1/f-induced phase noise psd was shown to be significantly lower than the estimate using the standard 1/f noise model. For a source follower reset circuit, measured 1/f noise power was also shown to be lower than the estimate using the standard 1/f model. In analyzing noise in the follower reset circuit using frequency-domain analysis, a low cutoff frequency that is inversely proportional to the circuit on-time is assumed. The choice of this low cutoff frequency is quite arbitrary and can cause significant inaccuracy in estimating noise power. Moreover, during reset, the circuit is not in steady state, and thus frequency-domain analysis does not apply. This paper proposes a nonstationary extension of the standard 1/f noise model, which allows us to analyze 1/f noise in switched MOSFET circuits more accurately. Using our model, we analyze noise for the three aforementioned switched circuit examples and obtain results that are consistent with the reported measurements.","1558-125X","","10.1109/82.917783","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=917783","","Circuit noise;Switching circuits;MOSFET circuits;Noise measurement;Frequency domain analysis;Measurement standards;Switched circuits;Power measurement;Phase noise;Cutoff frequency","1/f noise;MOS integrated circuits;switched networks;integrated circuit noise;phase noise;frequency-domain analysis;integrated circuit modelling","1/f noise;switched MOSFET circuits;periodically switched transistor;noise power spectral density;ring oscillator;induced phase noise;source follower reset circuit;frequency-domain analysis;cutoff frequency;nonstationary extension","","56","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of them is how to determine a feasible path that satisfies a set of constraints while maintaining high utilization of network resources. The latter objective implies the need to impose an additional optimality requirement on the feasibility problem. This can be done through a primary cost function (e.g., administrative weight, hop count) according to which the selected feasible path is optimal. In general, multi-constrained path selection, with or without optimization, is an NP-complete problem that cannot be exactly solved in polynomial-time. Heuristics and approximation algorithms with polynomial and pseudo-polynomial-time complexities are often used to deal with this problem. However, existing solutions suffer either from excessive computational complexities that cannot be used for online network operation or from low performance. Moreover, they only deal with special cases of the problem (e.g., two constraints without optimization, one constraint with optimization, etc.). For the feasibility problem under multiple constraints, some researchers have proposed a nonlinear cost function whose minimization provides a continuous spectrum of solutions ranging from a generalized linear approximation (GLA) to an asymptotically exact solution. We propose an efficient heuristic algorithm for the most general form of the problem. We first formalize the theoretical properties of the above nonlinear cost function. We then introduce our heuristic algorithm (H MCOP), which attempts to minimize both the nonlinear cost function (for the feasibility part) and the primary cost function (for the optimality part). We prove that H MCOP guarantees at least the performance of GLA and often improves upon it. H MCOP has the same order of complexity as Dijkstra's algorithm. Using extensive simulations on random graphs with correlated and uncorrelated link weights, we show that under the same level of computational complexity, H MCOP outperforms its (less general) contenders in its success rate in finding feasible paths and in the cost of such paths.","0743-166X","0-7803-7016-3","10.1109/INFCOM.2001.916274","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=916274","","Cost function;Heuristic algorithms;Polynomials;Computational complexity;Constraint optimization;Quality of service;NP-complete problem;Approximation algorithms;Linear approximation;Computational modeling","quality of service;optimisation;computational complexity;polynomial approximation;nonlinear functions;telecommunication network routing;correlation methods","multi-constrained optimal path selection;quality-of-service guarantees;QoS guarantees;packet networks;network resources;administrative weight;hop count;optimization;NP-complete problem;heuristics;approximation algorithms;pseudo-polynomial-time complexity;polynomial-time complexity;online network operation;nonlinear cost function minimization;generalized linear approximation;asymptotically exact solution;efficient heuristic algorithm;primary cost function;H MCOP;Dijkstra's algorithm;random graphs;simulations;correlated link weights;uncorrelated link weights;computational complexity;success rate;Internet;scalable routing","","193","","51","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Lab. of Pattern Recognition, Beijing, China; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","","2001","9","5","699","712","A function-based evaluation approach is proposed for a systematic study of fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-like controllers. This approach is applied for deriving process-independent design guidelines from addressing two issues: simplicity and nonlinearity. To examine the simplicity of fuzzy PID controllers, we conclude that direct-action controllers exhibit simpler design properties than gain-scheduling controllers. Then, we evaluate the inference structures of direct-action controllers in five criteria: control-action composition, input coupling, gain dependency, gain-role change, and rule/parameter growth. Three types of fuzzy PID controllers, using one-, two- and three-input inference structures, are analyzed. The results, according to the criteria, demonstrate some shortcomings in Mamdani's two-input controllers. For keeping the simplicity feature like a linear PID controller, a one-input fuzzy PID controller with ""one-to-three"" mapping inference engine is recommended. We discuss three evaluation approaches in a nonlinear approximation study: function-estimation-based, generalization-capability-based and nonlinearity-variation-based approximations. The study focuses on the last approach. A nonlinearity evaluation is then performed for several one-input fuzzy PID controllers based on two measures: nonlinearity variation index and linearity approximation index. Using these quantitative indices, one can make a reasonable selection of fuzzy reasoning mechanisms and membership functions without requiring any process information. From the study we observed that the Zadeh-Mamdani's ""max-min-gravity"" scheme produces the highest score in terms of nonlinearity variations, which is superior to other schemes, such as Mizumoto's ""product-sum-gravity"" and ""Takagi-Sugeno-Kang"" schemes.","1941-0034","","10.1109/91.963756","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=963756","","Fuzzy control;Fuzzy systems;Three-term control;Control systems;Pi control;Proportional control;Process design;Guidelines;Engines;Performance evaluation","fuzzy logic;fuzzy control;common-sense reasoning;fuzzy systems;control system analysis;three-term control;control nonlinearities","function-based evaluation approach;fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative-like controllers;one-input inference structures;process-independent design guidelines;simplicity;nonlinearity;direct-action controllers;gain-scheduling controllers;control-action;input coupling;gain dependency;gain-role change;rule/parameter growth;three-input inference structures;two-input inference structures;one-input fuzzy PID controller;one-to-three mapping inference engine;nonlinear approximation;function-estimation-based approximations;generalization-capability-based approximations;nonlinearity-variation-based approximations;nonlinearity variation index;linearity approximation index;quantitative indices;fuzzy reasoning mechanisms;membership functions;max-min-gravity scheme","","120","","39","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The use of direct-conversion receiver (DCR) architecture, however, has been limited due to two well-known problems, namely, the 1/f noise and the direct-current offset noise, to which conventional architectures are less sensitive. This paper analyzes these noise effects on reception performance of a DCR with alternating-current (ac) coupling filter in the receive path. A mathematical treatment of the performance of a DCR is provided. A performance bound of a DCR given its 1/f noise roll-off frequency and ac-coupling filter cut-off frequency is first obtained using vector coding. Then, the performance of a more practical adaptive reception method using a linear equalizer is discussed. Adaptability is especially important in rapidly time-varying channels such as in the wireless environment. The linear equalizer is effective at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) below 9 dB, but its performance degrades significantly at larger SNR. To achieve high performance at large SNR (>9 dB), a spectrum shaping method using line codes for direct-conversion reception is proposed. This method achieves near-optimum direct-conversion reception at high SNR while maintaining low complexity and adaptability at the receiver.","1558-0857","","10.1109/26.911459","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=911459","","Radio frequency;Filters;Cutoff frequency;Equalizers;Costs;Performance analysis;Working environment noise;Vectors;Time-varying channels;Signal to noise ratio","radio receivers;1/f noise;circuit noise;adaptive equalisers;FIR filters;analogue processing circuits;analogue-digital conversion","direct-conversion RF receiver design;direct-conversion receiver architecture;direct-current offset noise;reception performance;alternating-current coupling filter;1/f noise roll-off frequency;ac-coupling filter cut-off frequency;vector coding;adaptive reception method;linear equalizer;rapidly time-varying channels;signal-to-noise ratio;performance;spectrum shaping method;line codes;direct-conversion reception;complexity;adaptability;FIR filter","","82","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In these applications, one of the most desired properties from such linear mappings is clustering, which means the locality between objects in the multidimensional space being preserved in the linear space. It is widely believed that the Hilbert space-filling curve achieves the best clustering (Abel and Mark, 1990; Jagadish, 1990). We analyze the clustering property of the Hilbert space-filling curve by deriving closed-form formulas for the number of clusters in a given query region of an arbitrary shape (e.g., polygons and polyhedra). Both the asymptotic solution for the general case and the exact solution for a special case generalize previous work.

It has often been observed that in practice, simple structured controllers suffice for good sub-optimal control, and recent research in the artificial intelligence community has focused on policy search methods as techniques for finding sub-optimal controllers when such structured controllers do exist. Traditional model-based reinforcement learning algorithms make a certainty equivalence assumption on their learned models and calculate optimal policies for a maximum-likelihood Markovian model. We consider algorithms that evaluate and synthesize controllers under distributions of Markovian models. Previous work has demonstrated that algorithms that maximize mean reward with respect to model uncertainty leads to safer and more robust controllers. We consider briefly other performance criterion that emphasize robustness and exploration in the search for controllers, and note the relation with experiment design and active learning.

Furthermore, the proposed schemes can be employed for the detection of several diverse traffic objects of interest (vehicles, bicycles, etc.) The system outputs the spatio-temporal coordinates of each pedestrian during the period the pedestrian is in the scene. Processing is done at three levels: raw images, blobs, and pedestrians. Blob tracking is modeled as a graph optimization problem.

The sensor is intended for positioning of a mobile robot or platform. The acceleration signal output by the sensor is doubly integrated with time, which yields the travelled distance. Bias offset drift exhibited in the acceleration signal is accumulative and the accuracy of the distance measurement deteriorates with time due to the integration. This problem can be fixed by periodic recalibration by the use of external measurements on position, velocity, and attitude which can be compared with the corresponding quantities calculated by the inertial system. A Kalman filter could use the differences between those values to provide an optimum estimate of the system error. The random bias drift of the accelerometer was found experimentally to be 2.5 mg. The accelerometer was moved back and forth three times for a distance of 40 cm with an acceleration of 8 m/s/sup 2/. The final distance error accumulated was -1.08 cm.

"Designing fuzzy inference systems from data: An interpretability-oriented review","S. Guillaume","Cemagref, Montpellier, France","IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","","2001","9","3","426","443","Fuzzy inference systems (FIS) are widely used for process simulation or control. They can be designed either from expert knowledge or from data. For complex systems, FIS based on expert knowledge only may suffer from a loss of accuracy. This is the main incentive for using fuzzy rules inferred from data. Designing a FIS from data can be decomposed into two main phases: automatic rule generation and system optimization. Rule generation leads to a basic system with a given space partitioning and the corresponding set of rules. System optimization can be done at various levels. Variable selection can be an overall selection or it can be managed rule by rule. Rule base optimization aims to select the most useful rules and to optimize rule conclusions. Space partitioning can be improved by adding or removing fuzzy sets and by tuning membership function parameters. Structure optimization is of a major importance: selecting variables, reducing the rule base and optimizing the number of fuzzy sets. Over the years, many methods have become available for designing FIS from data. Their efficiency is usually characterized by a numerical performance index. However, for human-computer cooperation another criterion is needed: the rule interpretability. An implicit assumption states that fuzzy rules are by nature easy to be interpreted. This could be wrong when dealing with complex multivariable systems or when the generated partitioning is meaningless for experts. The paper analyzes the main methods for automatic rule generation and structure optimization. They are grouped into several families and compared according to the rule interpretability criterion. For this purpose, three conditions for a set of rules to be interpretable are defined.","1941-0034","","10.1109/91.928739","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=928739","","Fuzzy systems;Fuzzy logic;Hybrid intelligent systems;Process control;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy control;Expert systems;Design optimization;Input variables;Performance analysis","knowledge acquisition;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory;large-scale systems;multivariable systems;performance index;knowledge based systems;inference mechanisms","fuzzy inference systems;interpretability-oriented review;automatic rule generation;system optimization;space partitioning;rule base optimization;structure optimization;human-computer cooperation;rule interpretability;complex multivariable systems","","438","","66","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Deployment of DR on distribution networks could potentially increase their reliability and lower the cost of power delivery by placing energy sources nearer to the demand centers. By providing a way to by-pass conventional power delivery systems, DR could also offer additional supply flexibility. The trends in technology points toward smallness, under the 500 kW level. An example are the small gas fired micro-turbines in the 25-100 kW range that can be mass produced at low cost. Fuel cells are also well suited for distributed generation applications. There are two basic classes of micro-source systems; one is a DC source, such as fuel cells, photovoltaics, and battery storage, the other is a high frequency AC source such as the micro-turbine which needs to be rectified.

Co., Seoul, South Korea; NA","IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","","2001","37","2","727","739","The problem of three-dimensional (3D) radar tracking is considered. The usual tracking filter design relying on first-order (or linear) approximations leads to poor convergence and erratic filter behavior in highly nonlinear situations. Simple filter algorithms that can overcome these ill effects are developed for two different types of 3D radar measurement. For each type of radar measurement, an accurate expression for the measurement covariance is obtained by evaluating inherent nonlinearities of radar measurements via coordinate transformation. Then algebraic manipulations and reasonable approximations are employed to yield a simple filter formulation based on the expression. The resulting filter equations are similar to the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and provide some useful insights into the behavior of linearized Kalman filters designed with radar measurements.

This paper presents a unified constant-frequency integration (UCI) APF control method based on one-cycle control. This method employs an integrator with reset as its core component to control the pulse width of an AC-DC converter so that its current draw is precisely opposite to the reactive and harmonic current draw of the nonlinear loads. In contrast to previously proposed methods, there is no need to generate a current reference for the control of the converter current, thus no need for a multiplier and no need to sense the AC line voltage, the APF current, or the nonlinear load current. Only one AC current sensor is used to sense the AC main current and one DC voltage sensor is used to sense the DC capacitor voltage. The control method features constant switching frequency operation, minimum reactive and harmonic current generation, and simple analog circuitry. It provides a low cost and high performance solution for power quality control. Steady-state and dynamic study is presented in this paper. Design example is given using a two-level AC-DC boost topology. A prototype was developed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed APF. This control method is generalized to control a family of converters that are suitable for APF applications.

Proceedings of the Conference (Cat. No.01TH8533)","","2001","","","45","","Summary form only given, as follows. One of the largest issues in commercializing hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) is the cost and life of the batteries. This is particularly true with plug-in HEVs that can provide all-electric operation for a given range. In this study, various hybrid electric vehicle configurations were analyzed for battery size, cost and predicted battery life. Battery lifetimes were calculated based upon a deep-discharge model using various driving scenarios and charging frequencies. Two plug-in HEV models were considered, namely an HEV with a 20-mile all-electric range (HEV 20) and an HEV with a 60-mile all-electric range (HEV 60). Four ""real world"" driving schedules were analyzed based upon survey responses of approximately 400 drivers. The results from the survey were grouped by one-way daily commute distance. Total annual and all electric miles were calculated for each vehicle configuration and driving schedule, using the survey results. Using all-electric fuel economy and battery size calculated using the NREL ADVISOR model, battery energy use was calculated during each vehicle lifetime for each scenario. Using a deep-discharge model, the number of deep discharge cycles were calculated for each driving situation and vehicle configuration to determine the all-electric battery driving potential in terms of total vehicle miles and calendar years. Based upon the calculations, the HEV 20 had an all-electric battery driving potential of approximately 29000 all-electric miles before the battery degraded below 80% of its original capacity (assumed to occur after 1750 deep-discharge cycles). The HEV 60 had an all-electric battery driving potential of approximately 87000 all-electric miles. Because HEVs also use a gasoline engine to operate in a charge sustaining mode, this all-electric potential translated into 46000 to 174000 total vehicle miles for the HEV 20 and 104000 to 220000 total vehicle miles for the HEV 60, depending upon driving patterns and charging frequency. While in some cases, the HEV 20 might exceed its total battery all-electric driving potential during the vehicle lifetime, there are several methods to mitigate the need for battery replacement. These are explained in this paper. In the event battery replacement is needed, replacement costs are estimated under two commercial scenarios.","1089-8182","0-7803-6545-3","10.1109/BCAA.2001.905098","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=905098","","Hybrid electric vehicles;Commercialization;Vehicle driving;Battery powered vehicles;Costs;Frequency;Fuel economy;Calendars;Degradation;Petroleum","electric vehicles;secondary cells;internal combustion engines;electric propulsion;economics","hybrid electric vehicle;commercialization issues;battery cost;battery life;plug-in HEVs;all-electric operation;battery size;deep-discharge model;driving scenarios;charging frequencies;vehicle configuration;survey;NREL ADVISOR model;battery energy use;deep discharge cycles;gasoline engine;battery replacement;replacement costs;20 mile","","8","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is found that the dielectric breakdown mechanism also depends on thickness. For relatively thick films (thickness >500 nm), the dielectric breakdown is electromechanical in origin, i.e. the dielectric strength is proportional to the square root of Young's modulus of the films. By scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation, a microcrack in thicker films may contribute to a lower value of Young's modulus, which may confirm that the electromechanical breakdown is the dominant mechanism for dielectric breakdown of thicker films. In addition, the thickness dependent dielectric strength can be described by the well-known inverse power-law relation by using different exponents to describe different thickness ranges, However for thinner films, i.e., <500 nm, the experimentally observed relationships among the dielectric strength, Young's modulus, and film thickness cannot be explained by the existing models.","1558-4135","","10.1109/94.919946","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=919946","","Dielectric breakdown;Dielectric films;Dielectric thin films;Dielectric measurements;Permittivity;Dielectrics and electrical insulation;Scanning electron microscopy;Dielectric materials;Polymer films;Optical films","permittivity;electric strength;semiconductor device breakdown;scanning electron microscopy;Young's modulus;insulating thin films;characteristics measurement;MIS devices;semiconductor device measurement","thickness dependent dielectric strength;low-permittivity dielectric film;I-V measurements;metal-insulator-semiconductor structures;Young's modulus;scanning electron microscopy;microcrack;inverse power-law relation","","80","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this context, we design detectors relying on the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) and on a two-step GLRT-based design procedure. Remarkably, both criteria lead to receivers ensuring the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) property with respect to the unknown quantities. A thorough performance assessment of the proposed detection strategies, together with the evaluation of their processing cost, highlights that the two-step design procedure is to be preferred with respect to the plain GLRT. In fact, the former leads to detectors that achieve satisfactory performance under several situations of practical interest and are simpler to implement than those designed resorting to the latter.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.928688","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=928688","","Detection algorithms;Radar scattering;Light scattering;Radar detection;Covariance matrix;Testing;Boats;Gaussian noise;Detectors;Aircraft","radar detection;adaptive signal detection;radar tracking;radar resolution;target tracking;Gaussian noise;covariance matrices;radar receivers;maximum likelihood estimation","GLRT-based adaptive detection algorithms;range-spread targets;Gaussian noise;unknown covariance matrix;secondary data;covariance matrix;cells under test;generalized likelihood ratio test;two-step GLRT-based design;receivers;constant false alarm rate;CFAR;performance;processing cost;high-resolution radar;MLE","","216","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For a wide range of problems including robust analysis and synthesis, multichannel H/sub 2/ stateand output-feedback syntheses, the approach leads to potentially less conservative linear matrix inequality (LMI) characterizations. This comes from the fact that the technical restriction of using a single Lyapunov function is to some extent ruled out in this new approach. Moreover, the approach offers new potentials for problems that cannot be handled using earlier techniques. An important instance is the eigenstructure assignment problem blended with Lyapunov-type constraints which is given a simple and tractable formulation.","1558-2523","","10.1109/9.975496","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=975496","","Control system synthesis;Lyapunov method;Robust control;Linear matrix inequalities;Control systems;Riccati equations;Uncertainty;Robustness;Software tools;Automatic control","control system synthesis;control system analysis;robust control;eigenstructure assignment;H/sup /spl infin// control;matrix algebra;Lyapunov methods;linearisation techniques;feedback","continuous-time analysis;eigenstructure assignment;enhanced linear matrix inequality characterizations;enhanced LMI characterizations;control system analysis;control system synthesis;continuous-time systems;Lyapunov variables transformation;projection lemma reciprocal variant;linearizing transformations;robustness;multichannel H/sub 2/ state-feedback synthesis;output-feedback synthesis","","290","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A feasible dual-mode control scheme is presented in the paper, sliding mode predictive controller is implemented while the system state is outside the terminal region, besides sliding mode variable structure control designed off-line is used. The resulting control scheme has strong points of the two control methods. By predicting the pre-designed switching function, the predictive control sequence can be found by solving constrained open-loop optimal control problem, and the current control is implemented. At next sampling time the optimizing procedure is repeated. By constraining terminal sliding mode with an inequality, the state is steered into the predesigned sliding mode region, then the closed-loop stability is proved, and furthermore the system performance is analyzed.

The observer gain selection is extremely critical for good behavior of this system. A framework is developed, in which the properties of any gain selection can easily be assessed. Four candidate gain selections are considered, two of which yield schemes that do not use the rotor speed in their equations (inherently sensorless schemes).

The second is to show that there is a convenient way of estimating the parameters without removing the transformer from service. A Manitoba Hydro 250 MVA OFAF transformer was chosen and instrumented with data-gathering equipment. Two twenty-four hour test runs were performed, one in February of 1999 and the other in July of 1999.

A challenging aspect of this problem is to find a suitable shape signature that can be constructed and compared quickly, while still discriminating between similar and dissimilar shapes. In this paper, we propose and analyze a method for computing shape signatures for arbitrary (possibly degenerate) 3D polygonal models. The key idea is to represent the signature of an object as a shape distribution sampled from a shape function measuring the global geometric properties of an object. The primary motivation for this approach is to reduce the shape matching problem to the comparison of probability distributions, which is simpler than traditional shape matching methods that require pose registration, feature correspondence or model fitting. We find that the dissimilarities between sampled distributions of simple shape functions (e.g. the distance between two random points on a surface) provide a robust method for discriminating between classes of objects (e.g. cars versus airplanes) in a moderately sized database, despite the presence of arbitrary translations, rotations, scales, reflections, tessellations, simplifications and model degeneracies. They can be evaluated quickly, and thus the proposed method could be applied as a pre-classifier in an object recognition system or in an interactive content-based retrieval application.","","0-7695-0853-7","10.1109/SMA.2001.923386","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=923386","","Shape measurement;Biological system modeling;Application software;Computer vision;Computer graphics;Biology computing;Probability distribution;Surface fitting;Robustness;Airplanes","solid modelling;mathematical morphology;probability;pattern matching;object recognition;content-based retrieval","3D model matching;shape distributions;3d shape similarity measurement;3D polygonal models;computer vision;molecular biology;computer graphics;shape signature;shape distribution;sampling;shape function;global geometric properties;shape matching;probability distributions comparison;object class discrimination;translations;rotations;scales;reflections;tessellations;simplifications;model degeneracies;pre-classifier;object recognition system;interactive content-based retrieval application","","220","","61","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accurate estimation of the ultrasonic echo pattern is essential in determining the object/propagation path properties. In this study, we model ultrasonic backscattered echoes in terms of superimposed Gaussian echoes corrupted by noise. Each Gaussian echo in the model is a nonlinear function of a set of parameters: echo bandwidth, arrival time, center frequency, amplitude, and phase. These parameters are sensitive to the echo shape and can be linked to the physical properties of reflectors and frequency characteristics of the propagation path. We address the estimation of these parameters using the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) principle, assuming that all of the parameters describing the shape of the echo are unknown but deterministic. In cases for which noise is characterized as white Gaussian, the MLE problem simplifies to a least squares (LS) estimation problem. The iterative LS optimization algorithms when applied to superimposed echoes suffer from the problem of convergence and exponential growth in computation as the number of echoes increases. In this investigation, we have developed expectation maximization (EM)-based algorithms to estimate ultrasonic signals in terms of Gaussian echoes. The EM algorithms translate the complicated superimposed echoes estimation into isolated echo estimations, providing computational versatility. The algorithm outperforms the LS methods in terms of independence to the initial guess and convergence to the optimal solution, and it resolves closely spaced overlapping echoes.","1525-8955","","10.1109/58.920713","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=920713","","Shape;Maximum likelihood estimation;Iterative algorithms;Gaussian noise;Noise shaping;Frequency;Microstructure;Bandwidth;Parameter estimation;Least squares approximation","ultrasonic scattering;echo;maximum likelihood estimation;Gaussian noise;white noise;optimisation","computational model;ultrasonic echo;expectation maximization algorithm;reflector;propagation path;maximum likelihood estimation;white Gaussian noise","","161","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper describes key features and benefits of the waveform under development and describes several suggestions for improving the waveform that the authors believe should be considered by the TWG. Suggested improvements include a proposed alternative to the various data structures for control channel orderwire bursts, and protocol improvements that would reduce slot-conflict problems for half-duplex terminals, provide a mechanism to accommodate operation over multiple satellites in the same coverage area, provide more effective methods for satellite range determination, and reduce network overhead by including terminal status within ranging bursts sent by terminals. The integrated waveform (IW) will extend the slave channel concept introduced by MIL-STD-188-183A by transmitting forward orderwire (FOW) bursts on selected control channels while user communication can be allocated to any available satellite channel. By eliminating the predefined time-slot frame formats used by MIL-STD-188-183, and by using the multi-h continuous phase modulation (CPM) developed for MIL-STD-188-181B, the IW can more than double the number of circuits that the existing satellite constellation can support. To gain user support, however, the IW has to do more than just increase the number of available services; it must also make communications easier and more reliable. The current DAMA waveforms already greatly increase the number of circuits that UHF SATCOM can support, but that capacity increase has not resulted in tremendous user support for DAMA. Without user acceptance, the IW will not be able to achieve the capacity increase that it is capable of providing.","","0-7803-7225-5","10.1109/MILCOM.2001.985923","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=985923","","Standards development;Circuits;Bandwidth;Military satellites;Data structures;Access protocols;Communication system control;Artificial satellites;Continuous phase modulation;Satellite constellations","UHF radio propagation;military communication;military standards;telecommunication standards;demand assigned multiple access;satellite communication;continuous phase modulation","integrated waveform;UHF SATCOM DAMA standards;Joint UHF MILSATCOM Technical Working Group;demand-assigned multiple access waveforms;DAMA waveforms;data structures;control channel orderwire bursts;protocol;half-duplex terminals;coverage area;satellite range determination;network overhead reduction;slave channel;MIL-STD-188-183A;forward orderwire bursts transmission;control channels;satellite channel;multi-h continuous phase modulation;CPM;satellite constellation;distributed control;automatic control;transponders design","","6","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Eng., California Univ., Los Angeles, CA, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","","2001","49","1","60","69","Design optimization of radially nonuniform spherical lens antennas is the focus of this paper. In particular, special attention is given to the optimal design of nonuniform Luneburg (1964) lens antennas. One of the important engineering objectives of designing an optimal Luneburg lens antenna is to use as small number of shells as possible while maintaining an acceptable gain and sidelobe performance. In a typical radially uniform design, by reducing the number of shells, the gain is decreased and the grating lobes are increased. This deficiency in the radiation performance of the uniform lens antenna can be overcome by designing the nonuniform lens antenna. This necessitates the optimum selection of each layer thickness and permittivity. A genetic algorithm (GA) optimizer with adaptive cost function is implemented to obtain the optimal design. In this manner, the GA optimizer simultaneously determines the optimal material and its thickness for each shell by controlling the gain and sidelobes envelope of the radiation pattern. Various lens geometries, including air gaps and feed offset from the lens surface, are analyzed by using the dyadic Green's functions of the multilayered dielectric sphere. Many useful engineering design guidelines have been suggested for the optimum construction of the lens. The results have been satisfactory and demonstrate the utility of the GA/adaptive cost-function algorithm. Additionally, the radiation characteristics of a novel two-shell lens antenna have been studied, and its performance is compared to the Luneburg lens.","1558-2221","","10.1109/8.910531","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910531","","Lenses;Optical design;Design optimization;Design engineering;Maintenance engineering;Performance gain;Gratings;Permittivity;Genetic algorithms;Cost function","lens antennas;antenna radiation patterns;genetic algorithms;Green's function methods;dielectric bodies","gain;two-shell lens antennas;antenna radiation characteristics;antenna design optimization;nonuniform Luneburg lens antennas;sidelobe performance;grating lobes;layer thickness;permittivity;optimal material;genetic algorithm optimizer;shell thickness;lens geometries;air gaps;feed offset;lens surface;dyadic Green's functions;multilayered dielectric sphere;engineering design guidelines;multibeam scanning","","88","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The two key contributions are a cooperative scheme for localizing the robots based on visual imagery that is more robust than decentralized localization, and a set of control algorithms that allow the robots to maintain a prescribed formation (shape and size). The ability to maintain a prescribed formation allows the robots to ""trap"" objects in their midst, and to ""flow"" the formation to a desired position. We derive the cooperative localization and control algorithms and present experimental results that illustrate the implementation and the performance of these algorithms.","","0-7803-6612-3","10.1109/IROS.2001.976240","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=976240","","Robot kinematics;Shape control;Robot sensing systems;Robust control;Size control;Laboratories;Robot vision systems;Materials handling;Degradation;Communication networks","multi-robot systems;mobile robots;path planning;position control;robot vision;image segmentation;image colour analysis","cooperative localization;formation control;multi-robot manipulation;cooperative manipulation tasks;vision;relative position;relative orientation;visual imagery;formation robots;Clodbuster","","94","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It features several merits such as multiple-output capability with one shared choke, single-stage energy processing and good input current shaping ability. But its major disadvantage is that the transformer leakage inductance causes high transient voltage across the bridge switches, which increases the switching rating and decreases the reliability. In this paper, an active soft switching circuit is proposed for the isolated full-bridge boost converter. The proposed soft switching circuit clamps the voltage across the full bridge, transfers the energy in the leakage inductance to the load, and provides zero voltage turn-off for all the main switches. Furthermore, the auxiliary switch features zero current turn-on and zero voltage turn-off. Therefore, the efficiency is improved.

Thus, highly robust performance is assured by the robust feedback controller. Moreover, by generalizing the relationship between the sampling period of plant output and the control period of plant input, the proposed method can be applied to various systems with hardware restrictions of these periods, which leads to higher performance.

In the past ten years, several techniques, methodologies and tools for designing low-power circuits have been presented in the scientific literature. However only a few of them have found their way in current design flows. The purpose of this paper is to summarize, mainly by way of examples, what in our experience are the most trustful approaches to low-power design. In other words, our contribution should not be intended as an exhaustive survey of the existing literature on low-power design; rather, we would like to provide insights a designer can rely upon when power consumption is a critical constraint.

The model is based on empirical measurements, self-generating, and applicable to online applications. This approach has been demonstrated to the prototype level. Physical performance is measured and forecast across time to estimate reliability. Time-series analysis is adapted to forecast performance. Exponential smoothing with a linear level and trend adaptation is applied. This procedure is computationally recursive and provides short-term, real-time performance forecasts which are linked directly to conditional reliability estimates. Failure clues must be present in the physical signals, and failure must be defined in terms of physical measures to accomplish this linkage.

FACTs use power electronic devices and methods to control the high-voltage side of the network for improving power flow. Custom power is for low-voltage distribution, and improving poor power quality and reliability of supplies affecting factories, offices and homes. Power quality and reliability are becoming important issues for critical and sensitive loads after the introduction of the term of custom power by Hingorani in the early 1980s. Custom power devices is classified into three categories by their structures: dynamic voltage restorers (DVRs), distribution STATCOMs (DSTATCOMs) and unified power quality compensators (UPQCs). Among these devices, the main purpose of a DVR that injects voltage in series with a distribution feeder is reducing the effect of short-term voltage sags, dips, swells and momentary interruptions. The DVR is capable of generating and absorbing voltage independently controllable real and reactive power. It consists of a three-phase voltage source inverter, injection transformer, DC link and rectifier for charging the DC link or battery. As is known, rectifiers generate harmonic problems in distribution lines. Rectifiers or devices for charging the DC link are useless in this proposed system due to their structure. The proposed system has the function of generating and absorbing voltage using a self-charging control technique. This system has three states: (1) normal operation; (2) charging operation; and (3) recharging operation. The paper discusses control issues and the proposed control algorithm. The proposed control technique is applied to a DSTATCOM for protecting voltage sags, swells and momentary interruptions.

The IC consists of fundamental RF building circuits-a power amplifier (PA), a low-noise amplifier (LNA), and a transmit/receive-antenna switch (SW), including almost all on-chip matching elements. The IC was fabricated using a 0.18-/spl mu/m standard bulk CMOS technology which has no extra processing steps to enhance the RF performances. Two new circuit-design techniques are introduced in the IC in order to minimize the insertion loss of the SW and realize a higher gain for the PA and LNA despite the utilization of the standard bulk CMOS technology. The first is the derivation of an optimum gate width of the SW to minimize the insertion loss based on small-signal equivalent circuit analysis. The other is the revelation of the advantages of interdigitated capacitors (IDCs) over conventional polysilicon to polysilicon capacitors and the successful use of the IDCs in the LNA and PA. The IC achieves the following sufficient characteristics for practical wireless terminals at 2.1 GHz and 1.8 V: a 5-dBm transmit power at a -1-dB gain compression, a 19-dB gain, an 18-mA current for the PA, a 1.5-dB insertion loss, more than 24-dB isolation, an 11-dBm power handling capability for the SW, a 7.5-dB gain, a 4.5-dB noise figure, and an 8-mA current for the LNA.","1558-173X","","10.1109/4.938369","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=938369","","CMOS technology;Insertion loss;Radiofrequency integrated circuits;Radio frequency;Low-noise amplifiers;Switches;CMOS integrated circuits;Capacitors;MMICs;Wireless communication","transceivers;MMIC power amplifiers;UHF power amplifiers;field effect MMIC;UHF integrated circuits;wireless LAN;microwave switches;CMOS analogue integrated circuits;equivalent circuits;frequency response;low-power electronics","single-chip Si-CMOS T/R-MMIC frontend;low insertion loss switch;short-range wireless communication;wireless LAN;Bluetooth LAN;power amplifier;low-noise amplifier;transmit/receive-antenna switch;on-chip matching elements;bulk CMOS technology;circuit-design techniques;optimum gate width;small-signal equivalent circuit analysis;interdigitated capacitors;gain compression;frequency response;cascode topology;2.4 GHz;1.8 V;19 dB;1.5 dB;7.5 dB;Si","","79","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two major design issues are addressed: one is to minimize motion artifact and the other is to minimize the consumption of battery power. An efficient double ring design is developed to lower the influence of external force, acceleration, and ambient light, and to hold the sensor gently and securely on the skin, so that the circulation at the finger may not be obstructed. Total power consumption is analyzed in relation to characteristics of individual components, sampling rate, and CPU clock speed. Optimal operating conditions are obtained for minimizing the power budget.

A desired compensation ARC scheme is then presented, in which the regressor is calculated using the reference trajectory information only. The resulting controller has several implementation advantages such as less online computation time, reduced effect of measurement noise, a separation of robust control design from parameter adaptation, and a faster adaptation rate.

The first approach utilizes a matched target filter that is derived from the signal history along the range-Doppler migration path mapped onto the SAR image from the moving target trajectory in real space. The coherent spatial filter is specified by the apparent target range in the image and the magnitude of the relative target-to-radar velocity. The second approach eliminates the range-dependence by reconstructing the moving target image from a spectral function that is obtained from the SAR image data spectrum via a spatial frequency coordinate transformation.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.951089","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=951089","","Radar polarimetry;Image processing;Synthetic aperture radar;Fast Fourier transforms;Matched filters;History;Trajectory;Spatial filters;Image reconstruction;Frequency","geophysical techniques;geophysical signal processing;terrain mapping;radar detection;radar theory;radar imaging;synthetic aperture radar;remote sensing by radar;fast Fourier transforms;image motion analysis","geophysical measurement technique;land surface;terrain mapping;radar remote sensing;SAR;radar detection;theory;synthetic aperture radar;moving target;radar imaging;image processing;image motion;smeared response;fast Fourier transform;Fourier spatial spectrum;matched target filter;range-Doppler migration path;SAR image;moving target trajectory;coherent spatial filter;spatial frequency coordinate transformation","","109","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A joint treatment of target tracking and target classification problems is introduced. First, a method for target classification using radar data and class-dependent kinematic models is presented. Second, a target classification method using ESM data is presented. Then, a Bayesian radar and ESM data fusion algorithm, referred to as direct identity fusion (DIF), for target classification is presented. This algorithm exploits the dependence of target state on target class via the use of class dependent kinematic models but fails to exploit the dependence of target class on target state. We then introduce a method, referred to as joint tracking and classification (JTC), for treating target tracking and classification problems jointly, by exploiting the dependence of target class on target state via flight-envelope-dependent classes and the dependence of target state on target class via class dependent kinematic models. A two-dimensional example demonstrates the relative merits of these methods. It is shown that, while the incorporation of the two-way dependence between target state and class (i.e., JTC) promises some benefits over the method that incorporates only a one-way dependence (i.e., DIF), there are severe filter implementation difficulties for the former. The results also demonstrate that the fusion of information from radar and ESM sensors via the DIF approach results in improvements over classification methods based on either of the individual sensors.","1557-9603","","10.1109/7.953266","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=953266","","Target tracking;Radar tracking;Kinematics;Radar measurements;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Bayesian methods;Sensor fusion;Performance evaluation;Synthetic aperture radar;Filters","target tracking;radar tracking;sensor fusion;Bayes methods;signal classification;radar signal processing;radar theory","target tracking;radar sensor;ESM sensor;Bayesian target classification;electronic support measure;data fusion algorithm;direct identity fusion;joint tracking and classification;class-dependent kinematic model;two-dimensional filter;flight envelope","","84","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This approach is an extension of the original interpolating thin-plate spline approach and allows to take into account landmark localization errors. The extension is important for clinical applications since landmark extraction is always prone to error. The authors' approach is based on a minimizing functional and can cope with isotropic as well as anisotropic landmark errors. In particular, in the latter case it is possible to include different types of landmarks, e.g., unique point landmarks as well as arbitrary edge points. Also, the scheme is general with respect to the image dimension and the order of smoothness of the underlying functional. Optimal affine transformations as well as interpolating thin-plate splines are special cases of this scheme. To localize landmarks the authors use a semi-automatic approach which is based on three-dimensional (3-D) differential operators.

A pulse width modulation (PWM) technique is employed to control motor speed. A VI (virtual instrument) is developed with LabVIEW that allows the DAQ to read a user selected reference voltage continuously. The VI also generates a suitable triangular wave that with the help of the reference signal produces the desired PWM signal. PWM is an analog signal that switches between two predefined limits. The switching interval of the PWM, controlled by the reference signal, determines the average power delivered to the motor circuit. The PWM signal is sent through the output port of the DAQ by the VI which in turn controls the motor speed. User from the front panel of the VI may input the amplitude and the frequency of the triangular wave, sampling rate of the reference signal, and the desired amplitude of the PWM. As the reference voltage increases, the width of the PWM (duty cycle) increases which in turn increases the speed of the motor. The varying nature of the motor speed is demonstrated in the laboratory by changing the reference signal. The principle developed in this project will be utilized in future endeavor toward controlling robot motion remotely via Internet.","","0-7803-6748-0","10.1109/SECON.2001.923126","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=923126","","Velocity control;Pulse width modulation;DC motors;Data acquisition;Instruments;Voltage;Software packages;Space vector pulse width modulation;Open loop systems;Signal generators","DC motors;machine control;velocity control;pulse width modulation;data acquisition;telecontrol;digital control;virtual instrumentation;software packages","open-loop DC motor speed control;LabView;PWM technique;virtual instrument;data acquisition board;triangular wave;switching interval;sampling rate;reference voltage;duty cycle;remote control","","6","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The signal decomposition capability of SVD is exploited to extract the significant feature components of the ECG by decomposing the ECG into a set of basic patterns with associated scaling factors. The signal information is mostly concentrated within a certain number of singular values with related singular vectors due to the strong interbeat correlation among ECG cycles. Therefore, only the relevant parts of the singular triplets need to be retained as the compressed data for retrieving the original signals. The insignificant overhead can be truncated to eliminate the redundancy of ECG data compression. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital arrhythmia database was applied to evaluate the compression performance and recoverability in the retrieved ECG signals. The approximate achievement was presented with an average data rate of 143.2 b/s with a relatively low reconstructed error. These results showed that the truncated SVD method can provide efficient coding with high-compression ratios. The computational efficiency of the SVD method in comparing with other techniques demonstrated the method as an effective technique for ECG data storage or signals transmission.","1558-0032","","10.1109/4233.966104","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=966104","","Electrocardiography;Data compression;Singular value decomposition;Information retrieval;Signal resolution;Data mining;Feature extraction;Redundancy;Hospitals;Databases","electrocardiography;data compression;singular value decomposition;medical signal processing","ECG data compression;truncated singular value decomposition;signal decomposition;feature components;scaling factors;singular vectors;strong interbeat correlation;singular triplets;redundancy;Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital arrhythmia database;recoverability;coding;ECG data storage;ECG signal transmission;143.2 bit/s","Algorithms;Arrhythmias, Cardiac;Arrhythmias, Cardiac;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Databases as Topic;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electrocardiography;Humans;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","110","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Its goal is different from that of image watermarking, which embeds into the image a signature surviving most manipulations. Most existing methods for image authentication treat all types of manipulation equally (i.e., as unacceptable). However, some practical applications demand techniques that can distinguish acceptable manipulations (e.g., compression) from malicious ones. In this paper, we present an effective technique for image authentication which can prevent malicious manipulations but allow JPEG lossy compression. The authentication signature is based on the invariance of the relationships between discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients at the same position in separate blocks of an image. These relationships are preserved when DCT coefficients are quantized in JPEG compression. Our proposed method can distinguish malicious manipulations from JPEG lossy compression regardless of the compression ratio or the number of compression iterations. We describe adaptive methods with probabilistic guarantee to handle distortions introduced by various acceptable manipulations such as integer rounding, image filtering, image enhancement, or scaling-recaling. We also present theoretical and experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique.","1558-2205","","10.1109/76.905982","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=905982","","Robustness;Authentication;Transform coding;Image coding;Watermarking;Cryptography;Discrete cosine transforms;Digital signatures;Filtering;Digital images","discrete cosine transforms;image coding;data compression;transform coding;message authentication;iterative methods","robust image authentication method;JPEG compression;malicious manipulation;JPEG lossy compression;authentication signature;discrete cosine transform coefficient;DCT coefficients;compression iteration;distortions;integer rounding;image filtering;image enhancement;scaling-recaling","","343","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The relative weight of these components is constrained based on prior material assumptions. Excellent results are obtained for simulations and for phantom measurements.

That ring decomposition in turn yields a code construction from codes of lower lengths which turns out to be in some cases the celebrated squaring and cubing constructions and in other cases the (u+/spl upsi/|u-/spl upsi/) and Vandermonde constructions. All binary extended quadratic residue codes of length a multiple of three are shown to be attainable by the cubing construction. Quinting and septing constructions are introduced.

All specimens were from the same MUMP's 25 run at MCNC, and the thicknesses were 1.5, 2.0, and 3.5 /spl mu/m. Microstructure was examined in specimens as narrow as 2 /spl mu/m and ranging up to 20 /spl mu/m in width. The tensile specimens tested were 6, 20, or 600 /spl mu/m wide and 250, 1000, or 4000 /spl mu/m long. Nothing in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations indicates any effect of specimen size on the microstructure; the columnar grains are fine (0.2-0.5 /spl mu/m) and uniformly distributed. The widths of all specimens were found to differ from the specified mask values, and a more pronounced variation was measured for the smaller specimens. Three different approaches are used to measure Young's modulus, and they all give a value of 158/spl plusmn/10 GPa with no evidence of substantial effects of specimen size. However, the strength does increase somewhat as the total surface area of the test section decreases-from 1.21 GPa/spl plusmn/0.08 GPa to 1.65/spl plusmn/0.28 GPa-reflecting the fact that the larger specimens have more surface flaws.

They used a calorimeter to measure heat capacity and heat generation from batteries and infrared equipment to obtain thermal images of battery modules under load. In this paper, they present their approach for thermal characterization of batteries (heat generation, heat capacity, and thermal images) by providing selected data on valve regulated lead acid, lithium ion, and nickel zinc battery modules/cells. For each battery type, the heat generation rate depends on the initial state of charge, initial temperature, and charge/discharge profile. Thermal imaging indicated that the temperature distribution in modules/cells depends on their design.","1089-8182","0-7803-6545-3","10.1109/BCAA.2001.905129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=905129","","Hybrid electric vehicles;Thermal management;Battery management systems;Infrared heating;Temperature distribution;Character generation;Thermal conductivity;Testing;Battery charge measurement;Infrared imaging","secondary cells;electrochemistry;thermal analysis;temperature distribution;heat transfer;electric vehicles;infrared imaging;calorimetry","battery management;electric vehicles;hybrid electric vehicles;electrochemical performance;life cycle;battery pack;thermal characteristics;thermal management;heat capacity measurement;temperature distribution;heat generation measurement;charge/discharge profiles;calorimeter;state of charge;thermal imaging","","25","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These systems often rely on point-based registration to determine the transformation and many such systems use attached fiducial markers to establish accurate fiducial points for the registration, the points being established by some fiducial localization process. Accuracy is important to these systems, as is knowledge of the level of that accuracy. An advantage of marker-based systems, particularly those in which the markers are bone-implanted, is that registration error depends only on the fiducial localization and is, thus, to a large extent independent of the particular object being registered. Thus, it should be possible to predict the clinical accuracy of marker-based systems on the basis of experimental measurements made with phantoms or previous patients. For most registration tasks, the most important error measure is target registration error (TRE), which is the distance after registration between corresponding points not used in calculating the registration transform. Here, the authors derive an approximation to the distribution of TRE; this is an extension of previous work that gave the expected squared value of TRE. They show the distribution of the squared magnitude of TRE and that of the component of TRE in an arbitrary direction. Using numerical simulations, the authors show that their theoretical results are a close match to the simulated ones.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.952729","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=952729","","Neurosurgery;Surgery;Image registration;Hip;Anatomy;Accuracy;Imaging phantoms;Numerical simulation;Helium;Medical services","image registration;medical image processing;surgery;errors","target registration error distribution;rigid-body point-based registration;guidance systems;neurosurgery;hip surgery;spine surgery;attached fiducial markers;fiducial localization process;bone-implanted markers;experimental measurements;phantoms;target registration error;registration transform","Diagnostic Imaging;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","257","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With a high-performance field oriented control system, the torque and flux producing components of the stator current are decoupled so that the independent torque and flux controls are possible as in DC motors. Thus, a high quality control of the stator current vector is essential for the successful implementation of the field-oriented control since the current controller has a direct influence on the drive performance. The current control schemes for a voltage source inverter-fed PMSM drive can be classified as hysteresis control, ramp comparison control, synchronous frame proportional-integral (PI) control, and predictive control. Among them, the predictive control is known to give a superior performance. However, this control scheme requires the information on the machine parameters and operation conditions with the sufficient accuracy, and cannot give a satisfactory response under parameter mismatch. To overcome such a limitation, the robust speed control of a PMSM using sliding mode control with load torque estimation is presented. The load disturbance is detected by the observer of an unknown and inaccessible input, and is compensated by the feedforward current. The proposed control schemes are applied to PMSM driven by a three-phase voltage-fed PWM inverter and the effectiveness is verified through the comparative simulations.","","0-7803-7090-2","10.1109/ISIE.2001.931642","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=931642","","Robust control;Permanent magnet motors;Voltage control;Pi control;Proportional control;Sliding mode control;Torque control;Control systems;Stators;Predictive control","permanent magnet motors;synchronous motor drives;machine vector control;control system synthesis;machine theory;robust control;parameter estimation;observers;electric current control;velocity control;variable speed drives;stators;predictive control;variable structure systems;feedforward;PWM invertors;DC-AC power convertors;control system analysis","permanent magnet synchronous motor drives;load torque estimation;robust control;field-oriented control;control design;stator current decoupling;stator current vector control quality;predictive current control;robust speed control;speed control;sliding mode control;feedforward current;control simulation;three-phase voltage-fed PWM inverter","","6","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Kalman filters are used to track changes in features like vibration levels, mode frequencies, or other waveform signature features. This information is then functionally associated with load conditions using fuzzy logic and expert human knowledge of the physics and the underlying mechanical systems.

As such they found interesting application in digital video broadcasting systems as well as wireless multimedia services. Although a great deal of attention has been devoted in the literature to the study of the bit error rate (BER) performance of uniform quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations, very few results were published on the BER performance of hierarchical QAM constellations. Indeed the only available expressions ""leading-term"" approximate BER expressions for 4/16-QAM and 4/64-QAM. We obtain exact and generic expressions in M for the BER of the 4/M-QAM (square and rectangular) constellations over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and fading channels. For the AWGN case, these expressions are in the form of a weighted sum of complementary error functions and are solely dependent on the constellation size M, the carrier-to-noise ratio, and a constellation parameter which controls the relative message importance. Because of their generic nature, these new expressions readily allow numerical evaluation for various cases of practical interest. In particular numerical results show that the leading-term approximation gives significantly optimistic BER values at low carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) in particular over Rayleigh fading channels but is quite accurate in the high CNR region.","1557-9611","","10.1109/11.969372","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=969372","","Bit error rate;Quadrature amplitude modulation;AWGN;Fading;Protection;Digital video broadcasting;Digital multimedia broadcasting;Multimedia systems;Genetic expression;Additive white noise","quadrature amplitude modulation;AWGN channels;error statistics;Rayleigh channels;digital video broadcasting;multimedia communication;radiocommunication;approximation theory","4/M-QAM hierarchical constellations;digital video broadcasting systems;wireless multimedia services;bit error rate;BER performance;quadrature amplitude modulation;4/16-QAM;4/64-QAM;square constellations;rectangular constellations;additive white Gaussian noise channels;AWGN channels;error functions;constellation size;carrier-to-noise ratio;constellation parameter;leading-term approximation;Rayleigh fading channels","","82","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This autonomy refers to the extent to which the virtual agents are independent of user intervention and also the amount of information needed to simulate crowds. Thus, depending on the complexity of the simulation, simple behaviors can be sufficient to simulate crowds. Otherwise, more complicated behavioral rules can be necessary and, in this case, it can be included in the simulation data in order to improve the realism of the animation. We present three different ways for controlling crowd behaviors: by using innate and scripted behaviors; by defining behavioral rules, using events and reactions; and by providing an external control to guide crowd behaviors in real time. The two main contributions of our approach are: the possibility of increasing the complexity of group/agent behaviors according to the problem to be simulated and the hierarchical structure based on groups to compose a crowd.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.928167","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=928167","","Humans;Animation;Application software;Computational modeling;Virtual environment;Autonomous agents;Collaboration;Discrete event simulation","computer animation;digital simulation;real-time systems;behavioural sciences computing","hierarchical model;real time simulation;virtual human crowds;virtual agents;animation;behavioral rules;crowd motion","","240","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The resulting network topology increases the network lifetime by reducing the transmission power and reduces traffic interference by having low node degrees. Moreover, we show that the routes in the multihop network are efficient in power consumption.

Realistic vehicle following designs must also address parametric uncertainties such as mass of the vehicle, aerodynamic drag, and tire drag. The mass of the vehicle varies with the number of passengers. At small intervehicular separations, aerodynamic drag force changes significantly with the distance to be maintained.

Several techniques exist for reducing the noise coupling, of which one of the cheapest is separating the power supply distribution networks for the analog and digital circuits. Noise coupling from a digital noise-generating circuit through the power supply/substrate into an analog phase-locked loop (PLL) is analyzed for three different power supply schemes. The main mechanisms for noise coupling are identified by comparing different PLLs and varying their bandwidths. It is found that the main cause of jitter strongly depends on the power supply configuration of the PLL.

These results indicate that the FinFET is a promising structure for the future manufacturing of integrated circuits with sub-60-nm feature size, and that double-gate MOSFETs can meet international technology roadmap for semiconductors performance specifications without aggressive scaling of the gate-oxide thickness.","1558-0563","","10.1109/55.954920","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=954920","","FinFETs;MOSFET circuits;Silicon;Fabrication;Optical films;Resists;Etching;Scanning electron microscopy;Double-gate FETs;Capacitance-voltage characteristics","MOSFET;silicon;Ge-Si alloys;semiconductor technology;MOS integrated circuits","quasi-planar FinFETs;n-channel MOSFET;double-gate MOSFET;field-effect transistor;fin dimensions;gate dimensions;simplified process;short channel effects suppression;Si fin width;electrical gate oxide thickness;capacitance-voltage characteristics;C-V characteristics;integrated circuits;SiGe gate;30 to 60 nm;1 V;21 A;Si;SiGe","","112","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Matching this potential to specific customer needs, and evolving technologies with current economics remains an ongoing challenge. Recent successes have involved strong customer needs, usually of commercial customers, matched to fossil fuel distributed generation systems that meet reliability and economic targets. Many utilities, through its subsidiaries, have been active participants in this marketplace. Distributed generation is starting to expand its reach to address electric utility power delivery needs as a means to offset the cost of system expansion. This paper provides an example method to analyze this potential. It also shows that while power delivery savings can be significant, these must also be matched with additional customer benefits to make distributed generation economical. Also, once the potential fit of the technology and economics is established, a wide range of local and operational issues surface that challenge field implementation.","","0-7803-7012-0","10.1109/REPCON.2001.949510","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=949510","","Distributed control;Power generation economics;Fuel economy;Power system economics;Investments;Fossil fuels;Power system reliability;Power industry;Costs;Surface fitting","distribution networks;electricity supply industry;steam power stations;power generation economics;power generation planning","distributed generation;power delivery systems;potential benefits;utility investments;customer service improvement;customer needs;commercial customers;fossil fuel power generation systems;electric utilities;power delivery savings;customer benefits","","52","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many methods to solve this problem have been studied. In many control methods, torque ripple reduction was considered at the point of current control, which means that if current can be controlled properly, the BLDC motor does not produce any torque ripple. In this paper, the authors propose that torque ripple in the commutation period of a BLDC motor is inevitable, even if the current control is successful. A torque model, considered with decaying phase back EMF, is introduced and the causes of commutation torque are analyzed. The influence of commutation time on torque ripple and the relationship between commutation time and speed are introduced. This paper deals with torque ripple reduction of a BLDC motor from the viewpoint of commutation time and gives a theoretical background to reduce it.","","0-7803-7090-2","10.1109/ISIE.2001.931619","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=931619","","Brushless DC motors;Commutation;Torque control;Current control;DC motors;Switches;Inverters;Voltage control;Magnetic analysis;Magnetic materials","brushless DC motors;commutation;machine theory;electric current control;machine control;control system analysis;torque control;velocity control","brushless DC motor;commutation period torque ripple analysis;current control;commutation torque;commutation time;BLDC;torque model;decaying phase back EMF","","26","","4","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The level of information loss that is tolerable/acceptable varies for different applications. The loss is measured in terms of the bit error rate, or BER. An interesting application that employs error control coding is a system with a storage medium such as a hard disk drive or a compact disc (CD). We can think of the channel as a block that causes errors to occur when a signal passes through it. Regardless of the error source, we can describe the problem as follows: when the transmitted signal arrives at the receiver after passing through the channel, the received data will have some bits that are in error. The system designer would like to incorporate ways to detect and correct these errors. The field that covers such digital processing techniques is known as error control coding.","1558-1772","","10.1109/45.913208","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=913208","","Error correction;Bit error rate;Redundancy;Decoding;Digital communication;Computer errors;Loss measurement;Cellular phones;Hard disks;Surface emitting lasers","error correction codes;error detection codes;digital communication;error statistics","error control coding;digital communications;information loss;bit error rate;BER;storage medium;hard disk drive;compact disc;CD;error source;digital processing;error detection codes;error correction codes","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Using results on level crossing of random processes, an upper bound on the probability that the PAPR of an OFDM signal will exceed a given value is derived. Numerical computations are used to show that this bound is tight for low-pass OFDM systems. The central limit theorem is used to find an asymptotic expression for the bound when the number of carriers N grows to infinity. The central limit theorem is also used to find an asymptotic expression for another bound that is based on the envelope of the OFDM signal, and is tighter for bandpass systems. It is shown that, effectively, the PAPR grows as 2lnN and not linearly with N, and by developing a lower bound on the probability that the PAPR of an OFDM signal will exceed a given value, it is shown that asymptotically most OFDM symbols have a PAPR close to 2lnN.

A maximum power point tracking algorithm is developed using only load voltage information, eliminating array current detection. Analytical expressions for the PV array current and duty ratio of the converter corresponding to maximum power point operation of the solar cell array (SCA) are derived. SCA power output expressions with boost and interleaved dual boost converters are deduced. Load voltage based tracking effectiveness is demonstrated through simulation results. Experimental results validate the proposed method. Observations are also presented for partial shading conditions. The results obtained with this converter are compared with the boost converter PV system. It is demonstrated that the interleaved dual boost converter is more efficient and capable of reducing the ripple content in both source and load sides. As a result the interleaved dual boost converter photovoltaic systems require lower values of array input capacitance.

This paper first discusses the control approach of detecting source current in terms of the basic operation principle of a series APF, then developing a control approach of detecting load voltage. On the basis of these, a hybrid control approach is proposed. In this approach, the reference signal of the compensation voltage needed by the series APF is obtained by detecting both source current and load voltage. Thus, this approach has the advantages of the first and the second control approaches and, at the same time, it can overcome their respective drawbacks. For practical realization, the control methods of the PWM inverter in the series APF and for regulating its DC side voltage are discussed in detail. A prototype of the series APF is manufactured and corresponding experimental investigation is done. The results show that when the series APF, if adopting the hybrid control approach instead of the other two, compensates for the voltage type harmonics-producing load, its performance can be improved greatly.","1941-0107","","10.1109/63.923761","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=923761","","Active filters;Power system harmonics;Power harmonic filters;Voltage control;Pulse width modulation inverters;Power filters;Hybrid power systems;Switching converters;Power generation;Power system modeling","active filters;power harmonic filters;load (electric);compensation;power system control;load regulation;voltage control;PWM invertors;DC-AC power convertors;control system synthesis","series active power filter;hybrid control approach;voltage type harmonics-producing load compensation;compensation characteristics;source current detection;load voltage detection;PWM inverter","","117","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The results presented here are part of a broader project that considers this antenna system in the context of reconfigurable broadband (high-speed) networks. This paper concentrates only on the antenna design and on the development of efficient adaptive algorithms for beamforming and direction-of-arrival (DOA). The objective is to design an adaptive antenna that directs the maximum radiation of the antenna pattern toward the signal-of-interest (SOI), and places nulls toward the signal-not-of-interest (SNOI).

In order to reduce volume of the power supply, it is necessary to increase switching frequency of the power supply. The high operation frequency mainly reduces transformer volume in the power supply. However, a step-up ratio of the transformer in the high voltage DC power supply needs to be maintained. Therefore, the pulse transformer should be carefully designed to fulfil its function in the power supply. A high frequency and high voltage pulse transformer is designed, fabricated, and tested. Switching frequency of the transformer is 100 kHz. Input and output voltages of the transformer are 250 V and 4 kV, respectively. Normal operation power of the transformer is 3 kW. Maximum volume of the transformer is 400 cm/sup 3/. The power density is thus 7.5 W/cm/sup 3/. The transformer will be installed in a metal box that has nominal operation temperature of 85 degree centigrade. The transformer and other high voltage components in the box will be molded with silicon RIV that has a very low thermal conductivity. Procedures of design and test results are discussed.

The self-rectifying property of the GMR sensor used in this study leads to a simplified signal conditioning circuit, which can be fully integrated on a silicon chip with the GMR sensor. The ability to manufacture probes having small dimensions and high sensitivity (220 mV/mT) to low magnetic fields over a broad frequency range (from dc up to 1 MHz) enhances the spatial resolution of such an eddy-current testing probe.

Its main philosophical claims are that virtuality is itself a bonafide mode of reality, and that ""virtual reality"" must be understood as ""things, agents and events that exist in cyberspace"". These proposals resolve the incoherences found in the ordinary uses of these terms. In support of our claims we: 1) trace the historical origins of the word ""virtual""; 2) review some major definitions of ""virtual reality""; 3) discuss the sensory and causal aspects of virtual reality; and 4) set out the ontological difference between virtuality, possibility and actuality. In particular, our analysis shows that ""virtual reality"", though based on recent information technology, does not refer to mere technological equipment or purely mental entities, or to some fake environment as opposed to the real world, but that it is an ontological mode of existence which leads to an expansion of our ordinary world.","","0-7695-1402-2","10.1109/VSMM.2001.969726","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=969726","","Virtual reality;Ontologies;Information technology;Proposals;Information analysis;Space technology;Communication networks;Computer networks;Context;Natural languages","virtual reality;philosophical aspects","virtual reality;conceptual understanding;virtuality;possibility;actuality;philosophical aspects","","3","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fast IP address lookup in the routers, which uses the packet's destination address to determine for each packet the next hop, is therefore crucial to achieve the packet forwarding rates required. IP address lookup is difficult because it requires a longest matching prefix search. In the last couple of years, various algorithms for high-performance IP address lookup have been proposed.

Eng., Illinois Univ., Champaign, IL, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","","2001","49","10","2301","2313","We study the problem of optimal sub-Nyquist sampling for perfect reconstruction of multiband signals. The signals are assumed to have a known spectral support /spl Fscr/ that does not tile under translation. Such signals admit perfect reconstruction from periodic nonuniform sampling at rates approaching Landau's (1967) lower bound equal to the measure of /spl Fscr/. For signals with sparse /spl Fscr/, this rate can be much smaller than the Nyquist rate. Unfortunately the reduced sampling rates afforded by this scheme can be accompanied by increased error sensitivity. In a previous study, we derived bounds on the error due to mismodeling and sample additive noise. Adopting these bounds as performance measures, we consider the problems of optimizing the reconstruction sections of the system, choosing the optimal base sampling rate, and designing the nonuniform sampling pattern. We find that optimizing these parameters can improve system performance significantly. Furthermore, uniform sampling is optimal for signals with /spl Fscr/ that tiles under translation. For signals with nontiling /spl Fscr/, which are not amenable to efficient uniform sampling, the results reveal increased error sensitivities with sub-Nyquist sampling. However, these can be controlled by optimal design, demonstrating the potential for practical multifold reductions in sampling rate.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.950786","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=950786","","Nonuniform sampling;Sampling methods;Image reconstruction;Magnetic resonance imaging;Sensor arrays;Fourier transforms;Additive noise;Design optimization;System performance","signal sampling;signal reconstruction;optimisation;noise","multiband signals;optimal sub-Nyquist nonuniform reconstruction;optimal sub-Nyquist nonuniform sampling;perfect reconstruction;spectral support;translation;periodic nonuniform sampling;Landau's lower bound;Nyquist rate;reduced sampling rates;error sensitivity;mismodeling;additive noise;performance measures;optimal sampling rate;system performance;uniform sampling;nonuniform sampling pattern;multicoset sampling","","93","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For example, if a robot has a face, a human might interact with it similarly to how humans interact with other creatures with faces, Specifically, a human might talk to it, gesture to it, smile at it, and so on. If a human interacts with a computer or a machine that understands spoken commands, the human might converse with the machine, expecting it to have competence in spoken language. In our research on a multimodal interface to mobile robots, we have assumed a model of communication and interaction that, in a sense, mimics how people communicate. Our interface therefore incorporates both natural language understanding and gesture recognition as communication modes. We limited the interface to these two modes to simplify integrating them in the interface and to make our research more tractable. We believe that with an integrated system, the user is less concerned with how to communicate (which interactive mode to employ for a task), and is therefore free to concentrate on the tasks and goals at hand. Because we integrate all our system's components, users can choose any combination of our interface's modalities. The onus is on our interface to integrate the input, process it, and produce the desired results.","1941-1294","","10.1109/MIS.2001.1183338","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1183338","","Humans;Robot vision systems;Laser tuning;Personal digital assistants;Cameras;Robot sensing systems;Laboratories;Speech enhancement;Speech recognition;Speech processing","mobile robots;natural language interfaces;interactive systems;gesture recognition;human factors","multimodal human-robot interface;human functionalities;human-like machines;human-human communication;spoken commands;spoken language;multimodal interface;mobile robots;natural language understanding;gesture recognition;communication modes;integrated system;interactive mode","","116","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The major advantage of this framework is that the global visibility constraint is inherently enforced in the computation. This paper explores several key components of this framework including (1) three color segmentation based depth representations, (2) an incremental warping algorithm that dramatically reduces the computational complexity, and (3) scene constraints such as the smoothness constraint and the color similarity constraint.

The Internet community strongly fears that the current evolution could lead to congestion collapse and starvation of TCP traffic. For this reason, TCP-friendly protocols are being developed that behave fairly with respect to coexistent TCP flows. We present a survey of current approaches to TCP friendliness and discuss their characteristics.

The circuit also includes naturally and symmetrically distributed shorting pulses. Thus, the approach avoids the hassle of positioning the shorting pulses and defining and solving a set of nonlinear equations dedicated to CSR/Is. Moreover, the approach can eliminate an even or odd arbitrary number of harmonics (e.g., fundamental current control and elimination of the 5th, 7th, and 11th harmonics).

The proposed observer has the advantage of being insensitive to rotation direction. It is shown how a singularity at zero velocity appears in the scheme and how it can be avoided by switching smoothly from the observer-based closed-loop control to an open-loop control at low velocity.

The extracted rules can be used for making predictions in the semiconductor industry and other applications. This contrasts other approaches such as regression analysis and neural networks where a single model is built. One of the goals of data mining is to extract meaningful knowledge.

Optical, solid-state, and hybrid arrays of sensors have application for portable instruments, but issues of insufficient selectivity and sensitivity continue to hamper the widespread introduction of these miniaturized sensors for solving chemical sensing problems in environments outside the laboratory.

Madhow","Motorola Labs., Schaumburg, IL, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","","2001","47","6","2632","2639","The use of channel feedback from receiver to transmitter is standard in wireline communications. While knowledge of the channel at the transmitter would produce similar benefits for wireless communications as well, the generation of reliable channel feedback is complicated by the rapid time variations of the channel for mobile applications. The purpose of this paper is to provide an information-theoretic perspective on optimum transmitter strategies, and the gains obtained by employing them, for systems with transmit antenna arrays and imperfect channel feedback. The spatial channel, given the feedback, is modeled as a complex Gaussian random vector. Two extreme cases are considered: mean feedback, in which the channel side information resides in the mean of the distribution, with the covariance modeled as white, and covariance feedback, in which the channel is assumed to be varying too rapidly to track its mean, so that the mean is set to zero, and the information regarding the relative geometry of the propagation paths is captured by a nonwhite covariance matrix. In both cases, the optimum transmission strategies, maximizing the information transfer rate, are determined as a solution to simple numerical optimization problems. For both feedback models, our numerical results indicate that, when there is a moderate disparity between the strengths of different paths from the transmitter to the receiver, it is nearly optimal to employ the simple beamforming strategy of transmitting all available power in the direction which the feedback indicates is the strongest.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.945281","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=945281","","Encoding","encoding;array signal processing;adaptive antenna arrays;space-time adaptive processing;feedback;telecommunication channels;transmitting antennas;Gaussian processes;random processes;time-varying channels;covariance matrices;Rayleigh channels;land mobile radio","space-time transmit precoding;spatial channel;complex Gaussian random vector;receiver;mean feedback;wireline communications;wireless communications;reliable channel feedback;time varying channel;mobile radio applications;information theory;optimum transmitter;transmit antenna arrays;imperfect channel feedback;channel side information;distribution mean;covariance feedback;white covariance;propagation paths geometry;nonwhite covariance matrix;optimum transmission;information transfer rate;numerical optimization problems;feedback models;beamforming;Rayleigh fading channel model","","454","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"A lumped winding model for use in transformer models for circuit simulation","P. G. Blanken","Philips Res. Lab., Eindhoven, Netherlands","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","","2001","16","3","445","460","A lumped circuit model is derived for a winding in a multiwinding transformer. The model is intended to be used in transformer models for circuit simulation using electrical-network simulators. A hybrid (partly electrical, partly magnetic) modeling approach is adopted in which magnetic components are described using the capacitance-permeance analogy instead of the widespread resistance-reluctance analogy. The network correctly models energy storage and power dissipation due to DC series wire resistance and to eddy current losses, independent of the way of excitation of the winding (electrical and/or magnetic). All component values are frequency independent and are parameterized by geometrical parameters, winding data and material parameters. The mathematical continued-fraction approximation technique is applied to derive approximating circuits to model eddy current losses.

The resulting control law consists of a linear time-varying proportional-plus-derivative (PD) position error feedback control law and a linear time invariant trajectory feedforward control law.

While previous work in hierarchical classification focused on virtual category trees where documents are assigned only to the leaf categories, we propose a top-down level-based classification method that can classify documents to both leaf and internal categories. As the standard performance measures assume independence between categories, they have not considered the documents incorrectly classified into categories that are similar to or not far from correct ones in the category tree. We therefore propose category-similarity measures and distance-based measures to consider the degree of misclassification in measuring the classification performance. An experiment has been carried out to measure the performance of our proposed hierarchical classification method. The results showed that our method performs well for a Reuters text collection when enough training documents are given and the new measures have indeed considered the contributions of misclassified documents.","","0-7695-1119-8","10.1109/ICDM.2001.989560","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=989560","","Text categorization;Classification tree analysis;Tree graphs;Space technology;Sun;Information systems;Testing","classification;text analysis;trees (mathematics)","hierarchical text classification;hierarchical text evaluation;hierarchical category space;document;topdown level-based classification method;leaf categories;internal categories;performance measures;category tree;category-similarity measures;distance-based measures;Reuters text collection","","36","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

No.37243)","","2001","3","","1593","1602 vol.3","There are two general structures to design a control system through a network. The first structure is to have several subsystems, in which each of the subsystem contains a set of sensors, a set of actuators, and a controller by itself. These system components are attached to the same control plant. In this case, a subsystem controller receives a set point from the central controller. Another structure is to connect a set of sensors and a set of actuators to a network directly. Sensors and actuators in this case are attached to a plant, while a controller is separated from the plant via a network connection to perform a closed-loop control over the network. A challenging problem in control of networked-based system is network delay effects. The time to read a sensor measurement and to send a control signal to an actuator through the network depends on network characteristics such as their topologies, routing schemes, etc. Therefore, the overall performance of a network-based control system can be significantly affected by network delays. The severity of the delay problem is aggravated when data loss occurs during a transmission. Moreover, the delays do not only degrade the performance of a network-based control system, but also can destabilize the system. This tutorial presents fundamental details of network-based control and recent network-based control techniques for handling the network delays. The techniques are based on various concepts such as state augmentation, queuing and probability theory, nonlinear control and perturbation theory, and scheduling. A general structure of a network-based control system, delay types, and delay behaviors are also described in this tutorial. In addition, advantages and disadvantages of these techniques are discussed.","","0-7803-7108-9","10.1109/IECON.2001.975529","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=975529","","Tutorial;Control systems;Actuators;Centralized control;Delay effects;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Time measurement;Network topology;Routing;Propagation losses","control systems;closed loop systems;computer networks;computerised control;delays;nonlinear control systems;perturbation theory;probability;queueing theory","network-based control systems;subsystem;sensors;actuators;controller;closed-loop control;network delay effects;sensor measurement reading time;data networks;Internet;Ethernet;controller area networks;PROFIBUS;CAN;control signal;network characteristics;routing schemes;delay problem severity;data loss occurs;system destabilization;state augmentation;probability theory;queuing theory;nonlinear control;perturbation theory;scheduling;network-based control system;delay types;delay behaviors;time constraint","","71","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although the operation of the Wilson current mirror has been covered in most microelectronic circuit design textbooks, its unusual negative feedback mechanism is still largely obscure. As a result, attempts to calculate the output resistance of the Wilson current mirror using classical negative feedback analysis have usually given the answer that is inconsistent with the correct answers obtained from direct analysis. We believe that this is probably the main reason why the negative feedback analysis of the Wilson current mirror is mostly ignored in the literature. In this paper, we aim to disclose the hidden subtleties of the Wilson current mirror by shedding a new light on its dual-loop negative feedback operation. It is shown in the paper that by doing so, we will be able to apply the negative feedback theory to the Wilson current mirror and correctly calculate its current gain and port resistances.","","0-7803-6685-9","10.1109/ISCAS.2001.921910","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=921910","","Mirrors;Negative feedback;Electronic circuits;Immune system;Design engineering;Modems;Performance gain;Current measurement;Electrical resistance measurement;Gain measurement","current mirrors;circuit feedback;equivalent circuits","Wilson current mirror;output resistance;dual-loop negative feedback operation;port resistances;current gain","","1","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The prototype circular design demonstrates continuous pumping by regenerating a translating ferrofluidic plug at the conclusion of each pumping cycle. The flow rate can be controlled by adjusting device dimensions or the velocity of an external permanent magnet that directs the motion of the ferrofluid. The ferrofluidic plugs also serve as valves; if the magnetic actuator is stopped, pressure can be maintained with no power consumption. Flow can also be reversed by switching the direction of actuation. The maximum flow rate achieved with minimal backpressure was 45.8 /spl mu/l/min.

Two mutually orthogonal coils fed with phase-quadrature currents comprise the excitation source, which is equal to a mechanically rotating magnetic dipole. The resulting excitation field rotates elliptically at any position in the near-field region. The AC part of the squared field magnitude is a sinusoidal wave at twice the excitation frequency. The following set of parameters uniquely characterize the excitation at the sensor's position: the phase of the squared field waveform, relative to the excitation currents, the minimum field value, the ratio of the field extremes, and the orientation of the excitation field plane. Simple and explicit analytical expressions are given which relate the first three parameters to the azimuth, elevation, and distance from the source to the sensor, respectively. The orientation of the sensor axes, relative to the plane of the excitation, can easily be determined by comparing the phase and amplitude of the measured signals against the phase and amplitude of the excitation field at the sensor's position. Apart from simplicity, the proposed method increases the speed of tracking; a single period of excitation is in principle sufficient to obtain all of the information needed to determine both the sensor's position and orientation. A continuous sinusoidal excitation mode allows an efficient phase-locking and accurate detection of the sensor output. It also improves the electromagnetic compatibility of the method.","1941-0069","","10.1109/20.951014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=951014","","Magnetic field measurement;Coils;Magnetic sensors;Position measurement;Magnetic fields;Phase measurement;Frequency measurement;Azimuth;Phase detection;Electromagnetic compatibility","tracking;position measurement;magnetic sensors;magnetic field measurement","magnetic position tracking;magnetic orientation tracking;two-axis generation;quasi-static rotating magnetic field;three-axis sensing;mutually orthogonal coils;phase-quadrature currents;rotating excitation field;near-field region;sensor position;squared field waveform phase;minimum field value;field extremes ratio;excitation field plane orientation;azimuth;elevation;distance;continuous sinusoidal excitation mode;phase-locking;sensor output detection;electromagnetic compatibility;EMC improvement","","90","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The essential ingredient of progress has been miniaturization. The road to advances beyond a decade into the future has always been obscure and has stimulated much speculation as to where miniaturization must end. Thus far, new ideas have regularly met the challenges posed by new problems and have allowed the trends to continue. The persistence of silicon as the basis of information technology is the one constant. The problems and solutions arising from changing physics caused by miniaturization are examined in the perspective of the environment in which millions of closely packed devices must function and the external world that information processing technology serves. The complex structure of devices offers considerable room for ingenuity and novel approaches. The large number of devices collected on a single chip of silicon must communicate with one another via a complex array of wires. Miniaturization of the wires poses a different set of questions. The simple structure of a wire offers less scope for invention than is possible with devices and it is more difficult to see solutions to problems. Nevertheless, as has happened in the past, it is difficult to find obviously insuperable barriers to progress in fundamental physics.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.915372","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=915372","","Physics;Information processing;Integrated circuit technology;Chemical technology;Hardware;Wires;Silicon devices;Environmental economics;Information technology;Hip","digital integrated circuits;integrated circuit technology;elemental semiconductors;silicon;wiring","digital electronics;miniaturization;closely packed devices;complex array;wires;Si","","84","","50","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method is so named because of conceptual similarities to active phase conjugation methods that have been demonstrated in the ocean. In contrast to active techniques, however, the array in passive phase conjugation needs only receive. The procedure begins with a source transmitting a single probe pulse. After waiting for the multipathed arrivals to clear, the source then transmits the data stream. At each element in the distant receiving array, the received probe is cross-correlated with the received data stream. This cross-correlation is done in parallel at each array element and the results are summed across the array to achieve the final communication signal suitable for demodulation. As the ocean changes, it becomes necessary to break up the data stream and insert new probe pulses. Results from an experiment conducted in Puget Sound near Seattle are reported.

Techniques for detecting or assessing the presence of stress could help improve the robustness of speech recognition systems. Although some acoustic variables derived from linear speech production theory have been investigated as indicators of stress, they are not always consistent. Three new features derived from the nonlinear Teager (1980) energy operator (TEO) are investigated for stress classification. It is believed that the TEO based features are better able to reflect the nonlinear airflow structure of speech production under adverse stressful conditions. The features proposed include TEO-decomposed FM variation (TEO-FM-Var), normalized TEO autocorrelation envelope area (TEO-Auto-Env), and critical band based TEO autocorrelation envelope area (TEO-CB-Auto-Env). The proposed features are evaluated for the task of stress classification using simulated and actual stressed speech and it is shown that the TEO-CB-Auto-Env feature outperforms traditional pitch and mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCC) substantially. Performance for TEO based features are maintained in both text-dependent and text-independent models, while performance of traditional features degrades in text-independent models. Overall neutral versus stress classification rates are also shown to be more consistent across different stress styles.","1558-2353","","10.1109/89.905995","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=905995","","Stress;Speech recognition;Speech processing;Robustness;Speech analysis;Laboratories;Autocorrelation;Acoustic noise;Working environment noise;Multitasking","speech recognition;signal classification;mathematical operators;correlation methods;cepstral analysis","nonlinear feature based speech classification;nonlinear airflow structure;emotion;speech recognition systems;acoustic variables;linear speech production theory;nonlinear Teager energy operator;speech production;TEO-decomposed FM variation;normalized TEO autocorrelation envelope area;TEO autocorrelation envelope area;critical band;simulated stressed speech;actual stressed speech;mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients;text-independent models;text-dependent models;stress classification rates","","210","","57","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Fast Regular Expression Matching Using FPGAs","R. Sidhu; V. K. Prasanna","University of Southern California; NA","The 9th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM'01)","","2001","","","227","238","This paper presents an efficient method for finding matches to a given regular expression in given text using FPGAs. To match a regular expression of length n, a serial machine requires 0(2^n) memory and takes 0(1) time per text character. The proposed approach reqiures only 0(n^2) space and still process a text character in 0(1) time (one clock cycle).The improvement is due to the Nondetermineistic Finite Automaton (NFA) used to perform the matching. As far as the authors are aware, this is the first prctical use of a nondeterministic state machine on programmable logic. Furthermore, the paper presents a simple, fast algorithm that quickly constructs the NFA for the given regular expression. Fast NFA construction is crucial because the NFA structure depends on the regular expression, which is known only at runtime. Implementations of the algorithm for conventional FPGAs and the self-reconfigurable Gate Array (SRGA) are described. To evaluate performance, the NFA logic was mapped onto the Virtex XCV100 FPGA and the SRGA. Also, the performance of GNU grep for matching regular expressions was evaluated on an 800 MHz Pentium III machine. The proposed approach was faster than best case grep performance in most cases. It was orders of magnitude faster than worst case grep performance. Logic for the largest NFA considered fit in less than a 1000 CLBs while DFA storage for grep in the worst case consumed a few hundred megabytes.","","0-7695-2667-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1420919","","Field programmable gate arrays;Character generation;Chromium","","","","103","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Novel method of decreasing influence of phase noise on FMCW radar","K. S. Kulpa","Inst. of Electron. Syst., Warsaw Univ. of Technol., Poland","2001 CIE International Conference on Radar Proceedings (Cat No.01TH8559)","","2001","","","319","323","In the last decade, the frequency-modulated continues wave (FMCW) radar has been widely used both in military and civil (automotive) applications. Using low peak power it is possible to build reliable, low cost radar, which can measure target position, radial velocity and also the target radial acceleration. The radar sensitivity, accuracy and sub-clutter visibility (SCV) are limited by the transmitted power and the presence of phase noise in a transmitted signal. The influence of transmitter phase noise on FMCW radar performance has been investigated. The low-frequency 1/f type phase noise of FMCW radar free running oscillator degrades significantly the target velocity spectrum estimated by the 2-dimensional FFT of the video signal and thus limits the radar ability to detect moving targets against heavy ground clutter. To improve the radar performance the new method of low frequency phase noise compensation, based on the polynomial phase modeling concept has been worked out. On the basis of the received signal, assuming that ground clutter echoes are present in the signal, the low frequency phase noise polynomial model parameters are estimated. The estimated parameters are further used for digital correction of the video signal phase, which leads to a sharpened echo velocity spectrum and increased SCV and accuracy of velocity estimation. The presented concept can also be used for attenuation of synchronous interference in FMCW radar.","","0-7803-7000-7","10.1109/ICR.2001.984682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=984682","","Phase noise;Phase estimation;Radar clutter;Polynomials;Frequency estimation;Parameter estimation;Radar applications;Automotive engineering;Costs;Radar measurements","CW radar;FM radar;radar signal processing;video signal processing;radar clutter;military radar;road vehicle radar;radar interference;phase noise;fast Fourier transforms;1/f noise;parameter estimation;radar detection","frequency-modulated continues wave;military applications;civil applications;automotive radar;low peak power;low cost radar;reliable radar;target position measurement;radial velocity;target radial acceleration;radar sensitivity;radar accuracy;sub-clutter visibility;transmitted power;transmitted signal;FMCW radar performance;low-frequency 1/f phase noise;free running oscillator;target velocity spectrum;2D FFT;video signal;moving target detection;LF phase noise compensation;ground clutter echoes;polynomial model parameters;estimated parameters;digital correction;echo velocity spectrum attenuation;velocity estimation;synchronous interference","","8","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Lacaita","Dipt. di Elettronica e Inf., Politecnico di Milano, Italy; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","","2001","36","4","611","619","The automatic amplitude control (AAC) loop is an indispensable element for the practical realization of VCOs embedded in a complete transceiver. Its noise however can unacceptably degrade the single-sideband-to-carrier ratio (SSCR) performance of the oscillator, this problem being even exacerbated in low-voltage circuits. This paper addresses the design issues of a low-voltage low-noise differential LC-VCO with AAC, tunable within a 2.3-2.8-GHz frequency range, fully integrated in bipolar technology with 2-V power supply. First, the mechanisms through which the AAC noise affects the output phase are identified as the poor indirect stability and the AM-to-PM conversion due to the varactors. The effect of the AAC noise is discussed and substantially reduced with suitable design choices. We show that the achievable noise-to-signal ratio is bounded by the shot noise coming from the bias source of the differential oscillator, an intrinsic limit set by the low supply voltage which does not allow for degeneration of the tail transistor. Second, the design of the AAC is discussed. A large gain-bandwidth product (GBWP), about 100 MHz, has been implemented in order to correct for the fast oscillation amplitude variations and reduce the effect of the ground line disturbances. The expected value of the phase noise level, SSCR at 100 kHz =-104 dBc/Hz, is tightly matched by the experimental results. The core oscillator dissipates 7 mA, while less than 600 /spl mu/A are drawn by the AAC circuit.","1558-173X","","10.1109/4.913739","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=913739","","Voltage-controlled oscillators;Signal to noise ratio;Phase noise;Automatic control;Transceivers;Degradation;Tunable circuits and devices;Frequency;Integrated circuit technology;Power supplies","transceivers;bipolar analogue integrated circuits;MMIC oscillators;bipolar MMIC;UHF oscillators;circuit stability;shot noise;integrated circuit noise;phase noise;voltage-controlled oscillators","wide-band low-noise automatic amplitude control loop;transceiver;single-sideband-to-carrier ratio;bipolar technology;differential LC-VCO;indirect stability;AM-to-PM conversion;noise-to-signal ratio;shot noise;bias source;tail transistor;gain-bandwidth product;oscillation amplitude variations;ground line disturbances;phase noise level;2 V;2.3 to 2.8 GHz;100 kHz;7 mA","","51","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"GPS code and carrier multipath mitigation using a multiantenna system","J. K. Ray; M. E. Cannon; P.

Multipath accounts for most of the total error budget in carrier phase measurements in a spacecraft attitude determination system. It is a major concern in reference stations, such as in Local Area Augmentation Systems (LAAS), whereby corrections generated by a reference station, which are based on multipath corrupted measurements, can significantly influence the position accuracy of differential users. Code range, carrier phase, and signal-to-noise (SNR) measurements are all affected by multipath, and the effect is spatially correlated within a small area. In order to estimate and remove code and carrier phase multipath, a system comprising a cluster of five GPS receivers and antennas is used at a reference station location. The spatial correlation of the receiver data, and the known geometry among the antennas, are exploited to estimate multipath for each satellite in each antenna in the system. Generic receiver code and carrier tracking loop discriminator functions are analyzed, and relationships between receiver data, such as code range, carrier phase, and SNR measurements, are formulated and related to various multipath parameters. A Kalman filter is described which uses a combination of the available information from the antennas (receivers) in the multiantenna cluster to estimate various multipath parameters. From the multipath parameters, the code range and carrier phase multipath is estimated and compensated. The technique is first tested on simulated data in a controlled multipath environment. Results are then presented using field data and show a significant reduction in multipath error.","1557-9603","","10.1109/7.913677","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=913677","","Global Positioning System;Receiving antennas;Phase measurement;Position measurement;Area measurement;Antenna measurements;Phase estimation;Satellite antennas;Kinematics;Space vehicles","Global Positioning System;phase measurement;position control;multipath channels;Kalman filters;tracking;interference (signal);interference suppression;antenna arrays;attitude control;parameter estimation","GPS code;carrier multipath mitigation;multiantenna;Global Positioning System;static differential positioning;kinematic differential positioning;total error budget;carrier phase measurements;spacecraft attitude determination;Local Area Augmentation Systems;position accuracy;signal-to-noise measurements;remove code;carrier phase multipath;reference station location;spatial correlation;generic receiver code;carrier tracking loop discriminator;Kalman filter;multiantenna cluster;code range;controlled multipath environment;multipath error","","60","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Fault-tolerant control combines diagnosis with control methods to handle faults in an intelligent way. The aim is to prevent that simple faults develop into serious failure and hence increase plant availability and reduce the risk of safety hazards. Fault-tolerant control merges several disciplines into a common framework to achieve these goals. The desired features are obtained through online fault diagnosis, automatic condition assessment and calculation of appropriate remedial actions to avoid certain consequences of a fault. The envelope of the possible remedial actions is very wide. Sometimes, simple re-tuning can suffice. In other cases, accommodation of the fault could be achieved by replacing a measurement from a faulty sensor by an estimate. In yet other situations, complex reconfiguration or online controller redesign is required. This paper gives an overview of recent tools to analyze and explore structure and other fundamental properties of an automated system such that any inherent redundancy in the controlled process can be fully utilized to maintain availability, even though faults may occur.","0743-1619","0-7803-6495-3","10.1109/ACC.2001.946264","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=946264","","Fault tolerance;Automatic control;Fault diagnosis;Personnel;Safety;Hazards;Redundancy;Process control;Control systems;Availability","fault tolerance;process control;online operation;fault diagnosis;control system analysis","fault-tolerant control;automated processes;availability;online fault diagnosis;automatic condition assessment;remedial action calculation;re-tuning;measurement estimate;complex reconfiguration;online controller redesign;inherent redundancy","","128","","44","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We study three capacity regions for fading broadcast channels and obtain their corresponding optimal resource allocation strategies: the ergodic (Shannon) capacity region, the zero-outage capacity region, and the capacity region with outage. In this paper, we derive the outage capacity regions of fading broadcast channels, assuming that both the transmitter and the receivers have perfect channel side information. These capacity regions and the associate optimal resource allocation policies are obtained for code division (CD) with and without successive decoding, for time division (TD), and for frequency division (FD). We show that in an M-user broadcast system, the outage capacity region is implicitly obtained by deriving the outage probability region for a given rate vector. Given the required rate of each user, we find a strategy which bounds the outage probability region for different spectrum-sharing techniques. The corresponding optimal power allocation scheme is a multiuser generalization of the threshold-decision rule for a single-user fading channel. Also discussed is a simpler minimum common outage probability problem under the assumption that the broadcast channel is either not used at all when fading is severe or used simultaneously for all users. Numerical results for the different outage capacity regions are obtained for the Nakagami-m (1960) fading model.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.915667","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=915667","","Decoding","fading channels;broadcast channels;multiuser channels;decoding;channel capacity;optimisation;code division multiple access;time division multiple access;frequency division multiple access;probability;land mobile radio","optimal resource allocation;capacity allocation;fading broadcast channels;spectrum-sharing techniques;outage capacity regions;ergodic capacity region;Shannon capacity region;zero-outage capacity region;transmitter;receivers;channel side information;code division multiple access;successive decoding;time division multiple access;frequency division multiple access;multi-user broadcast system;rate vector;outage probability region;optimal power allocation;threshold-decision rule;single-user fading channel;minimum common outage probability;Nakagami-m fading model;CDMA;TDMA;FDMA;mobile wireless communication","","72","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In practice, there is always some imbalance and the image attenuation produced by the analog processing remains finite. Especially in wideband receivers, where the existence of strong image band signals makes the attenuation requirements extremely stringent, analog processing is incapable of providing adequate image rejection. We derive a general frequency-dependent signal model for an imbalanced analog front-end and present two alternative methods utilizing digital processing to enhance the analog front-end image rejection.

To alleviate these problems, this paper presents a simple and effective solution that involves shifting the original rectifier current to a new branch, which consists of a rectifier and a coupled winding of the boost inductor. When the active switch turns on, the current through the original boost rectifier is zero and the current decrease rate di/dt in the new branch is controlled by the leakage inductor. Based on the operation analysis, design issues to guarantee complete current shift are also addressed. Applying the proposed concept to a 500 W CCM DC/DC boost converter and a 500 W CCM power factor correction (PFC) boost converter with universal-line input generates a 2% efficiency improvement. The same concept can be easily extended to other basic DC/DC and CCM PFC converters.","1941-0107","","10.1109/63.949497","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=949497","","Rectifiers;Switches;Thyristors;Electromagnetic interference;Inductors;Power factor correction;Gallium arsenide;Silicon;Zero voltage switching;Resonance","DC-DC power convertors;AC-DC power convertors;rectifying circuits;electromagnetic interference;power factor correction;windings;switching circuits","rectifier reverse-recovery problem alleviation;continuous-current-mode boost converters;electromagnetic interference;EMI;DC/DC power conversion;coupled winding;boost inductor;rectifier;active switch turn on;leakage inductor;current decrease rate;operation analysis;design issues;power factor correction;universal-line input;efficiency improvement;500 W","","50","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Harmonic filtering of high-power 12-pulse rectifier loads with a selective hybrid filter system","D. Basic; V. S. Ramsden; P. K. Muttik","Centre for Electr. Machines & Power Electron., Univ. of Technol., Sydney, NSW, Australia; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","","2001","48","6","1118","1127","Current distortion of 12-pulse rectifier loads is significantly lower compared to six-pulse rectifier loads. However, in passive filtering of the lowest and dominant characteristic 11th and 13th harmonics, the use of 5th and 7th filters is often required in order to prevent possible parallel and series resonance between the passive filter and source impedance which can be excited by source background distortion or by load current residual noncharacteristic harmonics at the 5th and 7th harmonic frequencies. In hybrid filter systems, an active filter (AF) can be added in series with the passive filter in order to isolate the source and load. In most proposed hybrid filter systems, AF control is based on the detection of total current distortion and high-frequency inverters. With a selective AF control system and voltage-controlled inverter, the AF can be controlled to isolate the load at the critical frequencies only while at all other frequencies the passive filter function is preserved so that lower switching frequency and AF rating is required. In this paper, the authors present a selective AF filter control system and simple hybrid filter topology suitable for the compensation of high-power 12-pulse rectifier loads. Harmonic current controllers based on the second-order infinite-impulse response digital resonant filters are used, as they can be considered as simple digital algorithms for more complex double cascaded synchronous-reference-frame-based proportional plus integral controllers. They are centered to the targeted harmonic frequencies by using an adaptive fundamental frequency tracking filter. This approach gives good results, even if the reference waveform (in our case, a load voltage) is highly distorted or unbalanced and no separate phaselocked loop is required. Test results for a laboratory model of this system and stability analysis are presented and the importance of delay-time compensation is discussed.","1557-9948","","10.1109/41.969390","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=969390","","Power harmonic filters;Filtering;Rectifiers;Active filters;Passive filters;Frequency;Control systems;Resonance;Inverters;Voltage control","AC-DC power convertors;rectifying circuits;power conversion harmonics;power harmonic filters;harmonic distortion;passive filters;switching circuits;IIR filters;active filters","12-pulse rectifier load current distortion;selective hybrid filter system;harmonic filtering;passive filtering;parallel resonance;series resonance;active filter;total current distortion;switching frequency;harmonic current controllers;delay-time compensation;stability analysis;second-order infinite-impulse response digital resonant filters;double cascaded synchronous reference frame-based PI control","","53","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One innovative feature and advantage of this method is that, unlike other proposed approaches, it exploits the full set of network equations and does not require any simplifying assumptions. The method is based on a solved load flow and is easily understood and implemented. The loss allocation process emphasizes current rather than power injections, an approach that is intuitively reasonable and leads to a natural separation of system losses among the network buses. Results illustrate the consistency of the new allocation process with expected results and with the performance of other methods.","1558-0679","","10.1109/59.910787","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910787","","Propagation losses;Sparse matrices;Contracts;Computer networks;Equations;Load flow;Impedance;Admittance;Helium;Distributed power generation","power transmission;losses;load flow;electric admittance;impedance matrix","Z-bus loss allocation;transmission losses allocation;generators;loads;marginal price;merit-order approach;network Z-bus matrix;sparse Y-bus matrix;solved load flow;current injections;ancillary services;impedance matrix;admittance matrix","","267","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A harmonic time dependence is assumed. Both of the approaches, that of solving the field problem (harmonic analysis) and that of solving the corresponding eigenvalue problem (modal analysis), are described. A FEM software package has been created from scratch. Important aspects central to the efficient implementation of FEM are explained, such as memory management and solving the generalized piezoelectric eigenvalue problem. Algorithms for reducing the required computer memory through optimization of the matrix profile, as well as Lanczos algorithm for the solution of the eigenvalue problem are linked into the software from external numerical libraries. Our FEM software is applied to detailed numerical modeling of thin-film bulk acoustic wave (BAW) composite resonators. Comparison of results from 2D and full 3D simulations of a resonator are presented. In particular, 3D simulations are used to investigate the effect of the top electrode shape on the resonator electrical response. The validity of the modeling technique is demonstrated by comparing the simulated and measured displacement profiles at several frequencies. The results show that useful information on the performance of the thin-film resonators can be obtained even with relatively coarse meshes and, consequently, moderate computational resources.","1525-8955","","10.1109/58.949733","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=949733","","Finite element methods;Transistors;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Piezoelectric films;Memory management;Software algorithms;Equations;Harmonic analysis;Modal analysis;Software packages","thin film devices;bulk acoustic wave devices;finite element analysis;acoustic resonators;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;modal analysis;harmonic analysis","finite element model;electroelastic equations;linear forced vibration;piezoelectric device;modal analysis;harmonic analysis;eigenvalue problem;field problem;memory management;matrix profile optimization;Lanczos algorithm;numerical simulation;thin film bulk acoustic wave composite resonator;top electrode shape;software package;electrical response","","88","","64","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Drawing on the earlier work of Goodman and Mandayam (see IEEE Personal Commun. Mag., vol.7, p.48-54, 2000), we formulate the QoS of a data user via a utility function measured in bits per Joule. We consider distributed power control, modeled as a noncooperative game, where users maximize their utilities in a multicell system. Base station assignment based on received signal strength as well as received signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) are considered jointly with power control. Our results indicate that for both assignment schemes, such a procedure results in an inefficient operating point (Nash equilibrium) for the entire system. We introduce pricing of transmit power as a mechanism for influencing data user behavior and our results show that the distributed power control based on maximizing the net utility (utility minus the price) results in improving the Pareto efficiency of the resulting operating point. Variations of pricing based on global and local loading in cells are considered as a means of improving the efficiency of wireless data networks. Finally, we discuss the improvement in utilities through a centralized scheme where each base station (BS) calculates the best SIR to be targeted by the terminals it is assigned.","1558-0008","","10.1109/49.957304","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=957304","","Pricing;Power control;Intelligent networks;Base stations;Resource management;Multiaccess communication;Interference;Data systems;Power system modeling;Nash equilibrium","cellular radio;telecommunication control;power control;data communication;costing;tariffs;radiofrequency interference;quality of service;distributed control;radio networks;code division multiple access;multiuser channels","multicell wireless data network;noncooperative game;pricing;distributed power control;transmit power;QoS;utility function;base station assignment;received signal strength;received signal-to-interference ratio;SIR;Nash equilibrium;data user behavior;net utility maximisation;Pareto efficiency;local loading;global loading;centralized scheme;CDMA","","264","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper studies the visions of 4G from a technical perspective. After a brief review on the development history and status of mobile communications and related 4G perspectives, we present an overall 4G feature framework based on the kernel concept of integration, in which two key features (diversity and adaptability) of the three targets (terminals, networks and applications) are described in detail. The concepts of both external and internal diversity of each target are defined to illustrate the causes and solutions of the adaptability feature. Then, along the entire 4G domain, each feature in the framework is deeply discussed from a technical standpoint, in which promising techniques and possible research issues for sufficient support of adaptability are also proposed. Finally, a short summary on 4G visions is presented as a continuum of features in the development of the mobile communications world.","","0-7803-7206-9","10.1109/GLOCOM.2001.966339","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=966339","","4G mobile communication;3G mobile communication;Wireless communication;History;Wireless networks;Sun;Machine vision;Next generation networking;Kernel;Computer interfaces","cellular radio;technological forecasting;radio access networks","4G mobile wireless networks;technical perspective;mobile communications;wireless communication;diversity;adaptability;terminals;networks;applications;wireless access networks","","19","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These sensors provide a small contact area (/spl ap/0.6""/spl times/0.6"") for the fingertip and, therefore, sense only a limited portion of the fingerprint. Thus multiple impressions of the same fingerprint may have only a small region of overlap. Minutiae-based matching algorithms, which consider ridge activity only in the vicinity of minutiae points, are not likely to perform well on these images due to the insufficient number of corresponding points in the input and template images. We present a hybrid matching algorithm that uses both minutiae (point) information and texture (region) information for matching the fingerprints. Results obtained on the MSU-VERIDICOM database shows that a combination of the texture-based and minutiae-based matching scores leads to a substantial improvement in the overall matching performance.","","0-7803-6725-1","10.1109/ICIP.2001.958106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=958106","","Fingerprint recognition;Solid state circuits;Optical sensors;Biometrics;Data security;Biosensors;Information security;Image matching;Gabor filters;Matched filters","fingerprint identification;image matching;feature extraction;channel bank filters;filtering theory","fingerprint matching;minutiae features;texture features;solid-state fingerprint sensors;fingerprint matching algorithms;contact area;fingertip;ridge activity;input images;template images;hybrid matching algorithm;MSU-VERIDICOM database;matching performance;biometric indicators;Gabor filter bank","","115","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An advantageous feature of passive suspension systems is that they are intrinsically stable, in contrast to active magnetic bearings and therefore can provide much higher reliability, which is known to be the crucial factor in applications requiring continuous noncontact suspension of high-speed rotors. An example of such an application is flywheel energy storage systems, which are considered to be an attractive alternative to conventional electrochemical batteries from both environmental and overall energy efficiency aspects. In such systems, a high-speed rotor is used to accumulate energy in the form of kinetic energy, and its continuous noncontact suspension may be needed for many years with no faults being tolerable. The suspension design addresses some drawbacks of other passive magnetic suspension systems, such as high rotational losses, high manufacturing accuracy, and dynamical problems.

Each fuzzy IF-THEN rule in our classification system has antecedent linguistic values and a single consequent class. We use a fuzzy reasoning method based on a single winner rule in the classification phase. The winner rule for a new pattern is the fuzzy IF-THEN rule that has the maximum compatibility grade with the new pattern. When we use fuzzy IF-THEN rules with certainty grades, the winner is determined as the rule with the maximum product of the compatibility grade and the certainty grade. In this paper, the effect of rule weights is illustrated by drawing classification boundaries using fuzzy IF-THEN rules with/without certainty grades. It is also shown that certainty grades play an important role when a fuzzy rule-based classification system is a mixture of general rules and specific rules. Through computer simulations, we show that comprehensible fuzzy rule-based systems with high classification performance can be designed without modifying the membership functions of antecedent linguistic values when we use fuzzy IF-THEN rules with certainty grades.","1941-0034","","10.1109/91.940964","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=940964","","Fuzzy systems;Knowledge based systems;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy reasoning;Pattern classification;Fuzzy control;Control systems;Computer simulation;Helium;Application software","pattern classification;knowledge based systems;fuzzy systems;fuzzy set theory;inference mechanisms","pattern classification;fuzzy rule-based systems;fuzzy reasoning;fuzzy IF-THEN rule;membership functions;fuzzy set theory;rule extraction;function approximation","","317","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper details the development of an intelligent information filter for automated metering systems. The filter prevents false outage notifications in addition to improving the quality of outage data.

Power-aware metrics, where transmission power depends on distance between nodes and corresponding shortest power algorithms were also proposed. We define a power-cost metric based on the combination of both node's lifetime and distance-based power metrics. We investigate some properties of power adjusted transmissions and show that, if additional nodes can be placed at desired locations between two nodes at distance d, the transmission power can be made linear in d as opposed to d/sup /spl alpha// dependence for /spl alpha/ /spl ges/ 2. This provides basis for power, cost, and power-cost localized routing algorithms where nodes make routing decisions solely on the basis, of location of their neighbors and destination. The power-aware routing algorithm attempts to minimize the total power needed to route a message between a source and a destination. The cost-aware routing algorithm is aimed at extending the battery's worst-case lifetime at each node. The combined power-cost localized routing algorithm attempts to minimize the total power needed and to avoid nodes with a short battery's remaining lifetime.

In fact, the conventional range Doppler (RD) ISAR technique does not work properly when target motions generate terms higher than the first order in the phase of the received signal relative to each scatterer. This effect typically happens when at least one of these situations occur: (1) very high resolution images are required; (2) the target maneuvers; and (3) the target undergoes significant angular motions (roll, pitch, and yaw). A novel ISAR technique, named range instantaneous Doppler (RID), has been proposed for the reconstruction of very high resolution images of maneuvering targets. In this paper, we analytically show that the RID technique works properly when high-resolution ISAR images are required of maneuvering and/or rolling, pitching, and yawing targets; we also quantify the performance improvement of the RID technique with respect to the RD technique. The problem is tackled from an analytical point of view. First, we define a new model of the ISAR received signal that is valid for maneuvering targets, then we derive and compare the analytical expression of the point spread function (PSF) for the two techniques. Furthermore, we perform a statistical analysis to evaluate the improvement of the RID technique versus the RD technique in terms of spatial resolution. Finally, we prove the effectiveness of the RID technique by simulating the imaging process for two different targets: (1) a ship that undergoes roll, pitch and yaw motions and (2) a fast maneuvering airplane.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.974573","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=974573","","High-resolution imaging;Image resolution;Signal resolution;Inverse synthetic aperture radar;Signal generators;Radar scattering;Image reconstruction;Image analysis;Performance analysis;Signal analysis","synthetic aperture radar;Doppler effect;radar imaging;image resolution;radar resolution;image motion analysis;optical transfer function;image reconstruction","high-resolution ISAR imaging;maneuvering targets;range instantaneous Doppler technique;performance analysis;inverse synthetic aperture radar;target motions;received signal phase;very high resolution images;angular motions;roll;pitch;yaw;range instantaneous Doppler;image reconstruction;RID technique;point spread function;PSF;statistical analysis;spatial resolution;imaging process simulation;ship;fast maneuvering airplane;received signal model","","167","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Mining asteroids","M.

Elaborate plans have been drawn up for NEO missions. In a typical plan, a ship departs Earth for an asteroid when the two bodies' orbits are such that the lowest change in velocity, /spl Delta/V, is required. Mining operations might last many months, and meanwhile, Earth and the NEO would be moving farther and farther apart. When the two orbits coincided once again, the mined materials could be shipped back to Earth.

Artifact corruption of the underlying photoplethysmographic signals is reduced in real time, using an electronic processing methodology that is based upon inversion of a physical artifact model. This fundamental approach has the potential to provide uninterrupted output and superior accuracy under conditions of sustained subject motion, therefore, widening the clinical scope of this useful measurement. A new calibration technique for oxygen saturation is developed for use with these processed signals, which is shown to be a generalization of the classical Interpretation. The detailed theoretical and practical issues of Implementation are then explored, highlighting important engineering simplifications implicit in this new approach. A quantitative investigation of the degree of insensitivity to artifact is also undertaken, with the aid of a custom electronic system and commercial pulse oximeter probes, which is compared and contrasted with the performance of a conventional implementation. It is demonstrated that this new methodology results in a reduced sensitivity to common classes of motion artifact, while retaining the generality to be combined with conventional signal processing techniques.","1558-2531","","10.1109/10.915711","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=915711","","Pulse measurements;Signal processing;Blood;Optical saturation;Optical sensors;Optical signal processing;Absorption;Optical pulses;Motion measurement;Calibration","oximetry;plethysmography;calibration;medical signal processing","pulse oximetry method;inherent artifact insensitivity;electronic processing methodology;sustained subject motion;calibration technique;oxygen saturation;processed signals;important engineering simplifications;motion artifact;O/sub 2/","Artifacts;Calibration;Movement;Nonlinear Dynamics;Oximetry;Plethysmography;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","81","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper establishes a correlation between the SVPWM and DSPWM techniques. It also shows how to make the DSPWM strategy equivalent to the SVPWM technique without losing its simplicity of implementation. By using such an equivalence concept a microprocessor-based scheme, which uses standard timer circuits and a simple software algorithm, is proposed to implement the DSPWM technique. The introduction of the ""distribution ratio"" in this technique, allows the development of a systematic approach for implementing either conventional or any modified vector strategies without changing the modulator scheme. This corresponds to generating any attractive nonsinusoidal modulating signals (NSMS) in the carrier-based modulation techniques. Furthermore, the simple digital blocks can be easily implemented as a specialized integrated circuit.

ICCV 2001","","2001","2","","34","41 vol.2","Blob trackers have become increasingly powerful in recent years largely due to the adoption of statistical appearance models which allow effective background subtraction and robust tracking of deforming foreground objects. It has been standard, however, to treat background and foreground modelling as separate processes-background subtraction is followed by blob detection and tracking-which prevents a principled computation of image likelihoods. This paper presents two theoretical advances which address this limitation and lead to a robust multiple-person tracking system suitable for single-camera real-time surveillance applications. The first innovation is a multi-blob likelihood function which assigns directly comparable likelihoods to hypotheses containing different numbers of objects. This likelihood function has a rigorous mathematical basis: it is adapted from the theory of Bayesian correlation, but uses the assumption of a static camera to create a more specific background model while retaining a unified approach to background and foreground modelling. Second we introduce a Bayesian filter for tracking multiple objects when the number of objects present is unknown and varies over time. We show how a particle filter can be used to perform joint inference on both the number of objects present and their configurations. Finally we demonstrate that our system runs comfortably in real time on a modest workstation when the number of blobs in the scene is small.","","0-7695-1143-0","10.1109/ICCV.2001.937594","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=937594","","Bayesian methods;Robustness;Real time systems;Mathematical model;Deformable models;Power system modeling;Surveillance;Technological innovation;Cameras;Filters","Bayes methods;statistical analysis;inference mechanisms;tracking;computer vision","BraMBLe;Bayesian multiple-blob tracker;statistical appearance models;robust tracking;foreground modelling;background modelling;background subtraction;image likelihoods;multiple-person tracking system;single-camera real-time surveillance;Bayesian correlation;Bayesian filter","","309","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One key element shared by most methods is that they represent local image neighborhoods as constant in color or intensity with deviations modeled as noise. Due to computational considerations that encourage the use of small neighborhoods where this assumption holds, these methods remain popular. The research presented models a neighborhood as a distribution of colors. The goal is to show that the increase in accuracy of this representation translates into higher-quality results for low-level vision tasks on difficult, natural images, especially as neighborhood size increases. We emphasize large neighborhoods because small ones often do not contain enough information. We emphasize color because it subsumes gray scale as an image range and because it is the dominant form of human perception. We discuss distributions in the context of detecting edges, corners, and junctions, and we show results for each.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.969118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=969118","","Image edge detection;Computer vision;Colored noise;Object detection;Detectors;Color;Frequency;Humans;Earth;Application software","edge detection;image colour analysis;computational geometry;probability;bibliographies","corner detection;edge detection;junction detection;color distributions;computer vision;low-level vision tasks;local image neighborhoods;computational considerations;small neighborhoods;higher-quality results;natural images;neighborhood size;gray scale;image range;human perception;earth mover distance;perceptual color distance","","124","","55","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, an explicit-pulsed static flip-flop (ep-SFF) is the most energy-efficient and is ideal for the majority of critical paths in the design. In order to further reduce the power consumption, dual edge-triggered flip-flops are evaluated. It is shown that classic dual edge-triggered designs suffer from a large area penalty and reduced performance, prohibiting their use in critical paths.

In particular we use the level set method and fast sweeping and tagging methods to reconstruct surfaces from a scattered data set. The data set might consist of points, curves and/or surface patches. A weighted minimal surface-like model is constructed and its variational level set formulation is implemented with optimal efficiency. The reconstructed surface is smoother than piecewise linear and has a natural scaling in the regularization that allows varying flexibility according to the local sampling density.

The equivalent circuit consists of three ideal transformers, extended slotlines terminated by a short circuit, and microstrip transmission lines with open stubs. Two transformers are introduced to take account of the interaction between the aperture field and two orthogonal patch modes, while the third transformer reflects the coupling between the aperture and the feed line. The turn ratios of the transformers are calculated efficiently. The microstrip open stubs in the patch are then replaced by well-known capacitance and radiation conductance equivalents.

The pull-in phenomenon of a general electrostatic actuator with a single input is represented by an algebraic equation referred to as the pull-in equation. This equation directly yields the pull-in parameters, namely, the pull-in voltage or pull-in charge and the pull-in displacement. The model presented here permits the analysis of a wide range of cases, including nonlinear mechanical effects as well as various nonlinear, nonideal, and parasitic electrical effects. In some of the cases, an analytic solution is derived, which provides physical insight into how the pull-in parameters depend upon the design and properties of the actuator. The pull-in equation can also yield rapid numerical solutions, allowing interactive and optimal design. The model is then utilized to analyze analytically the case of a Duffing spring, previously analyzed numerically by Hung and Senturia, and captures the variations of the pull-in parameters in the continuum between a perfectly linear spring and a cubic spring. Several other case studies are described and analyzed using the pull-in equation, including parallel-plate and tilted-plate (torsion) actuators taking into account the fringing field capacitance, feedback and parasitic capacitance, trapped charges, an external force, and large displacements.","1941-0158","","10.1109/84.967384","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=967384","","Electrostatic actuators;Voltage;Nonlinear equations;Springs;Parasitic capacitance;Force feedback;Micromechanical devices;Electrostatic analysis;Medical services;Conductors","electrostatic actuators;torsion","pull-in parameters;electrostatic actuators;single input;algebraic equation;nonlinear mechanical effects;parasitic electrical effects;rapid numerical solutions;optimal design;interactive design;Duffing spring;perfectly linear spring;cubic spring;large displacements;parallel-plate actuators;tiltedplate actuators;torsion actuators;fringing field capacitance;feedback;trapped charges","","148","","43","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Yet these methods can be long and cumbersome and contribute little to intuition. In an attempt to preserve the intuitive grasp of tradeoffs, this paper presents an exercise of several well-established analytical techniques for generating and analyzing SFGs.

The AI techniques include fractal dimension analysis, multiresolution Markov random field, dogs-and-rabbits algorithm, and others. The fractal dimension analysis serves as a preprocessor to determine the approximate locations of the regions suspicious for cancer in the mammogram. The dogs-and-rabbits clustering algorithm is used to initiate the segmentation at the LL subband of a three-level DWT decomposition of the mammogram. A tree-type classification strategy is applied at the end to determine whether a given region is suspicious for cancer.

The new solution controls the variation of capacitor voltages into the mean '0' during some period by means of new carriers using the leg voltage redundancy in the flying capacitor inverter. The solution can be easily expanded to multi-level inverters. Also, this method can make the switching loss and conduction loss of devices equal by the use of leg voltage redundancy.

By minimizing a nonexplicit target function in which the oscillatory rotor modes of the generators involved and suing characteristics between areas are included, interactions among the FACTS controls under transient conditions in a multimachine power system are improved.

The results obtained from simulations validate the improvement in damping of overall power oscillations in the system in an optimal and globally coordinated manner. The simulations also show that the stabilizers tuned are robust in providing adequate damping for a range of conditions in the system.","1558-0679","","10.1109/59.932284","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=932284","","Damping;Power system simulation;Power system transients;Tuning;Robustness;Quadratic programming;Rotors;Character generation;Power generation;Control systems","flexible AC transmission systems;power transmission control;damping;optimal control;control system synthesis;control system analysis computing;power system analysis computing;robust control;power system dynamic stability","power system dynamic performance improvement;damping controls optimisation/coordination;global tuning procedure;FACTS;power system stabilizers;FACTS device stabilizers;parameter-constrained nonlinear optimization algorithm;sequential quadratic programming;dual algorithm;control simulation;computer simulation;nonexplicit target function minimisation;generator oscillatory rotor modes;transient conditions;multimachine power system;efficiency;robustness;power oscillations damping","","84","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the frequency of market-based dispatch updates increases, there will inevitably be interaction between the dynamics of markets determining the generator dispatch commands, and the physical response of generators and network interconnections. This paper examines questions of stability in such coupled systems by means of numeric tests using various market update models, (including detailed generator/turbine/governor dynamics) for the New England 39 bus test system. The results highlight the nature of potential instabilities and show the interaction modes between physical and market quantities through eigen-analysis. Understanding of potential modes of instability in such coupled systems is crucial both for designing suitable rules for power markets, and for designing physical generator controls that are compatible with market-based dispatch.","1558-0679","","10.1109/59.962415","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=962415","","Power system interconnection;Stability analysis;Power system analysis computing;Power system stability;Power system dynamics;System testing;Power system economics;Power generation economics;Frequency;Turbines","power system interconnection;power system stability;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;power generation dispatch;power system economics;electricity supply industry","stability analysis;interconnected power systems;market dynamics;generation dispatch;economic efficiency;market-based dispatch updates;generator dispatch commands;numeric tests;market update models;generator/turbine/governor dynamics;New England 39 bus test system;potential instabilities;interaction modes;eigen-analysis;generator controls;market-based dispatch","","111","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In practice, however, these invariants are usually implicit. An alternative to expecting programmers to fully annotate code with invariants is to automatically infer likely invariants from the program itself. This research focuses on dynamic techniques for discovering invariants from execution traces. This article reports three results. First, it describes techniques for dynamically discovering invariants, along with an implementation, named Daikon, that embodies these techniques. Second, it reports on the application of Daikon to two sets of target programs. In programs from Gries's work (1981) on program derivation, the system rediscovered predefined invariants. In a C program lacking explicit invariants, the system discovered invariants that assisted a software evolution task. These experiments demonstrate that, at least for small programs, invariant inference is both accurate and useful. Third, it analyzes scalability issues, such as invariant detection runtime and accuracy, as functions of test suites and program points instrumented.","1939-3520","","10.1109/32.908957","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=908957","","Programming profession;Testing;Instruments;Application software;Runtime;Detectors;Computer Society;Scalability;Formal specifications;Pattern analysis","software maintenance;reverse engineering","likely program invariants;program evolution;explicitly stated program invariants;program properties;modifying code;execution traces;Daikon;program derivation;software evolution;small programs;invariant inference;scalability","","441","","88","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The MUSIC algorithm for the DOA estimation is referred to as the spatial-MUSIC (S-MUSIC) algorithm. On the other hand, the temporal-MUSIC (T-MUSIC), which estimates the propagation delays, is introduced as well. Making use of the space-time characteristics of the multiray channel, the proposed algorithm-in a tree structure-combines the techniques of temporal filtering and of spatial beamforming with three one-dimensional (1-D) MUSIC algorithms, i.e., one S-MUSIC and two T-MUSIC algorithms. The incoming rays are thus grouped, isolated, and estimated. At the same time, the pairing of the estimated DOAs and delays is automatically determined. Furthermore, the proposed approach can resolve the incoming rays with very close DOAs or delays, and the number of antennas required by the TST-MUSIC algorithm can be made less than that of the incoming rays.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.912916","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=912916","","Direction of arrival estimation;Delay estimation;Multiple signal classification;Signal processing algorithms;Propagation delay;Filtering algorithms;Parameter estimation;Iterative algorithms;Stacking;Delay effects","array signal processing;direction-of-arrival estimation;signal classification;delay estimation;filtering theory;multipath channels","TST-MUSIC;joint DOA-delay estimation;multiple signal classification;time-space-time MUSIC;directions of arrival;propagation delays;wireless multiray channel;spatial-MUSIC;S-MUSIC algorithm;temporal-MUSIC;space-time characteristics;tree structure;temporal filtering;spatial beamforming;1D MUSIC algorithms;antennas","","88","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the necessary computational algorithms and their complexity still need some attention. We develop efficient algorithms for QFT, QCV, and quaternion correlation. The conventional complex two-dimensional (2-D) Fourier transform (FT) is used to implement these quaternion operations very efficiently. With these algorithms, we only need two complex 2-D FTs to implement a QFT, six complex 2-D FTs to implement a one-side QCV or a quaternion correlation and 12 complex 2-D FTs to implement a two-side QCV, and the efficiency of these quaternion operations is much improved. Meanwhile, we also discuss two additional topics. The first one is about how to use QFT and QCV for quaternion linear time-invariant (QLTI) system analysis. This topic is important for quaternion filter design and color image processing. Besides, we also develop the spectrum-product QCV. It is an improvement of the conventional form of QCV. For any arbitrary input functions, it always corresponds to the product operation in the frequency domain. It is very useful for quaternion filter design.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.960426","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=960426","","Quaternions;Fourier transforms;Convolution;Color;Filters;Image analysis;Algebra;Two dimensional displays;Frequency domain analysis;Helium","fast Fourier transforms;image colour analysis;convolution;correlation methods;computational complexity;spectral analysis","efficient implementation;quaternion Fourier transform;quaternion algebra;color image processing;2D complex FFT;quaternion convolution;quaternion correlation;computational algorithms;algorithm complexity;efficient algorithms;2D Fourier transform;quaternion linear time-invariant system analysis;quaternion filter design;spectrum-product QCV;input functions;product operation;frequency domain","","128","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We created a vibration feedback model, a decaying sinusoidal waveform, by measuring the acceleration of the stylus of a three degree-of-freedom haptic display as a human user tapped it on several real materials. A series of perceptual experiments, where human users rated the realism of various parameter combinations, were performed to further enhance the realism of the vibration display for impact events.

To support this demand economically, transport networks are evolving to provide a reconfigurable optical layer which, with optical cross-connects, will realize a high-bandwidth flexible core. As well as providing large capacity, this new layer will be required to support new services such as rapid provisioning of an end-to-end connection under customer control. The first phase of network evolution, therefore, will provide a circuit-switched optical layer characterized by high capacity and fast circuit provisioning. In the longer term, it is currently envisaged that the bandwidth efficiency associated with optical packet switching (a transport technology that matches the bursty nature of multimedia traffic) will be required to ensure economic use of network resources. This article considers possible network application scenarios for optical packet switching. In particular, it focuses on the concept of an optical packet router as an edge network device, functioning as an interface between the electronic and optical domains. In this application it can provide a scalable and efficient IP traffic aggregator that may provide greater flexibility and efficiency than an electronic terabit router with reduced cost.

The capacitors of the PFC, which generally cause resonant problems in harmonic distorted networks, can be used for passive filtering by connecting a transformer with a low magnetizing inductance in series hence creating a single harmonic trap. The primary side of the transformer is connected to a low VA-rated three-phase current controlled inverter which builds the active part of the hybrid topology.

Group, Aston Univ., Birmingham, UK; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","","2001","12","4","865","874","We simulate daily trading of straddles on financial indexes. The straddles are traded based on predictions of daily volatility differences in the indexes. The main predictive models studied are recurrent neural nets (RNN). Such applications have often been studied in isolation. However, due to the special character of daily financial time-series, it is difficult to make full use of RNN representational power. Recurrent networks either tend to overestimate noisy data, or behave like finite-memory sources with shallow memory; they hardly beat classical fixed-order Markov models. To overcome data nonstationarity, we use a special technique that combines sophisticated models fitted on a larger data set, with a fixed set of simple-minded symbolic predictors using only recent inputs. Finally, we compare our predictors with the GARCH family of econometric models designed to capture time-dependent volatility structure in financial returns. GARCH models have been used to trade volatility. Experimental results show that while GARCH models cannot generate any significantly positive profit, by careful use of recurrent networks or Markov models, the market makers can generate a statistically significant excess profit, but then there is no reason to prefer RNN over much more simple and straightforward Markov models. We argue that any report containing RNN results on financial tasks should be accompanied by results achieved by simple finite-memory sources combined with simple techniques to fight nonstationarity in the data.","1941-0093","","10.1109/72.935096","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=935096","","Recurrent neural networks;Predictive models;Quantization;Econometrics;Artificial intelligence;Noise reduction;Stochastic processes;Management information systems;Economic forecasting;Project management","stock markets;time series;recurrent neural nets;Markov processes","financial volatility trading;recurrent neural networks;daily straddle trading;financial indexes;daily volatility differences;daily financial time-series;noisy data;finite-memory sources;shallow memory;fixed-order Markov models;data nonstationarity;simple-minded symbolic predictors;GARCH family;econometric models;time-dependent volatility structure;Markov models","","65","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Each solution of the feature selection problem is represented as a binary string that indicates which features are selected and which are disregarded. In turn, each binary string corresponds to a point of a multidimensional binary space. Given a criterion function to evaluate the effectiveness of a selected solution, the proposed strategy is based on the search for constrained local extremes of such a function in the above-defined binary space. In particular, two different algorithms are presented that explore the space of solutions in different ways. These algorithms are compared with the classical sequential forward selection and sequential forward floating selection suboptimal techniques, using hyperspectral remote sensing images (acquired by the airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer [AVIRIS] sensor) as a data set. Experimental results point out the effectiveness of both algorithms, which can be regarded as valid alternatives to classical methods, as they allow interesting tradeoffs between the qualities of selected feature subsets and computational cost.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.934069","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=934069","","Hyperspectral sensors;Hyperspectral imaging;Remote sensing;Space exploration;Multidimensional systems;Infrared imaging;Infrared spectra;Spectroscopy;Infrared image sensors;Computational efficiency","geophysical techniques;geophysical signal processing;terrain mapping;multidimensional signal processing;feature extraction;remote sensing","geophysical measurement technique;land surface;terrain mapping;multispectral remote sensing;image processing;algorithm;feature selection;feature extraction;hyperspectral remote sensing;optical imaging;suboptimal search strategy;binary string","","223","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The large-signal behavior can be accurately predicted by using a simple algebraic equation including the mode limit of basic-switching-frequency operation as well as the input-output relations.

The FMCW radar uses a low-cost nonlinear voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), operating at an IF of 2.45 GHz to generate the frequency modulation of the radar system. This VCO signal is applied twice, first to generate the radar transmitter signal at 24 GHz, and then it is fed to a surface acoustic wave (SAW) delay line. The SAW delay line generates a fixed delay time, which corresponds with a fixed radar distance. Thus, all systematic nonlinearities and stochastic phase errors of the FMCW system can be monitored and, afterwards, can be compensated for in real time. This linearization technique leads to a significant enhancement in dynamic range for a FMCW radar system. For this FMCW system, SAW delay lines with a linear phase characteristic have been designed using a linear optimization program. The delay line consists of two chirped and weighted interdigital transducers. For high volume, low-cost, and high-yield production of the required SAW structures, with linewidths down to 0.3 /spl mu/m, technological improvements had to be achieved, especially in photolithography. Based on these design and fabrication techniques, delay lines at 2.45 GHz operating at the fundamental and third harmonic with bandwidths up to 800 MHz have been realized.","1557-9670","","10.1109/22.915465","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=915465","","Fabrication;Surface acoustic waves;Delay lines;Radar;Voltage-controlled oscillators;Frequency modulation;Signal generators;Transmitters;Acoustic waves;Delay effects","surface acoustic wave delay lines;CW radar;FM radar;linearisation techniques;interdigital transducers;UHF devices;photolithography;radar equipment","delay line fabrication;precise SAW delay lines;FMCW radar system;frequency-modulated radar system;continuous-wave radar system;industrial requirements;low-cost nonlinear VCO;nonlinear voltage-controlled oscillator;surface acoustic wave delay line;stochastic phase errors;linearization technique;dynamic range enhancement;linear phase characteristic;linear optimization program;apodized chirped transducers;chirped IDTs;weighted IDTs;interdigital transducers;2.45 GHz;24 GHz;0.3 micron;800 MHz","","42","","43","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Major problems that limit the success of current FES systems are the nonlinearity of the target system and the rapid change of muscle properties due to fatigue. In this study, four different strategies, including an adaptive algorithm, to control the movement of the freely swinging shank were developed on the basis of computer simulations and experimentally evaluated on two subjects with paraplegia due to a complete thoracic spinal cord injury. After developing a nonlinear, physiologically based model describing the dynamic behavior of the knee joint and muscles, an open-loop approach, a closed-loop approach, and a combination of both were tested. In order to automate the individual adjustments cited, we further evaluated the performance of an adaptive feedforward controller. The two parameters chosen for the adaptation were the threshold pulse width and the scaling factor for adjusting the active moment produced by the stimulated muscle to the fitness of the muscle. These parameters have been chosen because of their significant time variability. The first three controllers with fixed parameters yielded satisfactory result. An additional improvement was achieved by applying the adaptive algorithm that could cope with problems due to muscle fatigue, thus permitting on-line identification of critical parameters of the plant. Although the present study is limited to a simplified experimental setup, its applicability to more complex and functional movements can be expected.","1558-0210","","10.1109/7333.948452","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=948452","","Muscles;Fatigue;Adaptive algorithm;Open loop systems;Neuromuscular stimulation;Computer simulation;Spinal cord injury;Knee;Testing;Programmable control","patient rehabilitation;neuromuscular stimulation;biocontrol;physiological models;feedforward;feedback;identification;three-term control;performance index;control nonlinearities;nonlinear dynamical systems;piecewise linear techniques;biomechanics;adaptive control;motion control;closed loop systems","FES-induced single joint movements;model-based control;motor function control;artificial activation;paralyzed muscles;target system nonlinearity;adaptive algorithm;freely swinging shank;computer simulations;paraplegia;thoracic spinal cord injury;nonlinear physiologically based model;dynamic behavior;knee joint;open-loop approach;closed-loop approach;adaptive feedforward controller;threshold pulse width;scaling factor;muscle fatigue;on-line identification;biomechanical model;piecewise linear recruitment function;PID controller;feedback;performance index","Biomechanics;Computer Simulation;Electric Stimulation Therapy;Humans;Isometric Contraction;Knee Joint;Knee Joint;Motor Neurons;Muscle Fatigue;Muscle, Skeletal;Paraplegia;Paraplegia;Prosthesis Design;Range of Motion, Articular;Spinal Cord Injuries;Spinal Cord Injuries","143","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The FBW must meet extremely high levels of functional integrity and availability. The heart of the FBW concept is the use of triple redundancy for all hardware resources: computing system, airplane electrical power, hydraulic power and communication path. The architecture of the 777 flight controls system follows the earliest Boeing 7J7 design. The Boeing designed global DATAC bus, also known as ARINC 629 data bus, is used to communicate among all computing systems. Each DATAC bus is isolated, both physically and electrically from the other two. The three DATAC buses are not synchronized. The control system performance under the autonomous and asynchronous DATAC bus operation has been studied. The primary flight computers (PFCs) form a triple-triple redundant system; three PFC channels and three computing lanes in each channel. Each channel is also isolated, both physically and electrically from the other two. The microprocessor hardware for three computing lanes in each channel are dissimilar to facilitate detection of generic design errors of the most complicated hardware devices; microprocessors. The Byzantine general problem has been considered in the design of the PFC redundancy management to cope with functional asymmetry and communication asymmetry. The deferred maintenance is to provide hot spare modules within an LRU such that the airplane dispatchability can be enhanced. This concept is applied to the three major avionics systems, PFC, Air Data Inertial Reference System (ADIRU) and Airplane Information Management System (AIMS).","","0-7803-7034-1","10.1109/DASC.2001.963311","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=963311","","Aerospace safety;Aerospace electronics;Aerospace control;Airplanes;Hardware;Redundancy;Microprocessors;Availability;Heart;Computer architecture","avionics;aircraft maintenance;aircraft control;fault tolerant computing;aircraft computers;management information systems;computer architecture","flight control avionics;Boeing 777 airplane;fly-by-wire;ARINC 629 Bus;deferred maintenance","","19","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Mechanisms controlling the transition from glow silent discharge to streamer discharge in nitrogen","N. Gherardi; F. Massines","Lab. de Genie Electr., Univ. Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France; NA","IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","","2001","29","3","536","544","Low-energy dielectric-barrier controlled discharges in nitrogen are studied by undertaking electrical measurements to determine mechanisms controlling the transition from glow to streamer-like discharge. The highest and the lowest values of the frequency and the amplitude of power supply voltage leading to a glow discharge have been found dependent on the gas flow and the nature of the surface in contact with the discharge. These boundary values have been related to the criteria necessary for initiating a Townsend breakdown rather than a streamer breakdown commonly observed under such conditions. This implies: (1) that the seed electron density just before the breakdown is high enough to allow the development of numerous small avalanches under a low field avoiding the formation of only one large avalanche mechanism at the origin of the streamer formation; and (2) to let the time for ions issued from the first avalanches to reach the cathode before the electrical field becomes large enough to induce the formation of large avalanches. Practically, the transition from a Townsend breakdown to a streamer breakdown is analyzed from electrical measurements data coupled to the visual aspect of the discharge. Without any gas flow, the obtaining of an atmospheric pressure glow discharge (APGD) is mainly limited by the species etched from the surface in contact with the gas. Indeed, these species can be quenchers of the nitrogen metastable molecules, which are the species at the origin of the formation of seed electrons via the Penning effect. This limitation can be overcome by the use of a laminar gas flow. However, this type of gas flow through the discharge induces a depletion of N/sub 2/ metastables and, consequently, influences the electron density at the entrance of the discharge, leading to a tendency on this part of the discharge to transit to a streamer-like one.","1939-9375","","10.1109/27.928953","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=928953","","Fluid flow;Electric breakdown;Electrons;Nitrogen;Electric variables measurement;Glow discharges;Surface discharges;Contacts;Metastasis;Dielectrics","nitrogen;glow discharges;Townsend discharge;Penning discharges;surface discharges;plasma diagnostics;plasma flow;laminar flow;electron density;plasma density;electron avalanches;metastable states","glow silent discharge;streamer discharge;N;low-energy dielectric-barrier controlled discharges;electrical measurements;discharge transition;streamer-like discharge;frequency;amplitude;power supply voltage;glow discharge;gas flow;surface;boundary values;Townsend breakdown;streamer breakdown;seed electron density;breakdown;small avalanches;low field;large avalanche mechanism;streamer formation;cathode;electrical field;visual aspect;atmospheric pressure glow discharge;quenchers;metastable molecule;seed electrons;Penning effect;laminar gas flow;N/sub 2/ metastables;electron density;time variation;voltage;photons;N/sub 2/","","157","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These features are then used to train HMMs to represent various bearing conditions. The technique allows for online detection of faults by monitoring the probabilities of the pre-trained HMM for the normal case. It also allows for the diagnosis of the fault by the HMM that gives the highest probability.

The technique presented focuses on this latter process, and assumes the motion of the target is known. The new technique offers several advantages over conventional techniques which are based on the correlation imaging function. In particular, the technique provides for a direct 3D estimate (versus back projection to a 3D target grid matrix) of the locations of the dominant scattering centers using only a minimum set of independent 2D range-Doppler ISAR ""snapshots"" of the target. Because of the snapshot nature of the technique, it is particularly applicable to 3D imaging of sectors of sparse-angle data, for which the sidelobes of the correlation imaging integral become high. Furthermore, the technique provides for an estimate of amplitude and phase of each scattering center as a function of aspect angle to the target, for those aspect angles which encompass the set of 2D range-Doppler snapshots.

For mathematical comparison, a derivation of the second method (the continuous layer-peeling algorithm) is presented. The methods are compared both mathematically and numerically. We find that the discrete layer-peeling algorithm is significantly faster and can be more stable than its continuous counterpart, whereas the continuous algorithm offers some advantages in flexibility.","1558-1713","","10.1109/3.903065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=903065","","Gratings;Optical propagation;Riccati equations;Electromagnetic scattering;Optical fibers;Optical coupling;Optical reflection;Optical scattering;Particle scattering;Inverse problems","Bragg gratings;optical fibre theory;optical design techniques;causality","layer peeling;fiber Bragg grating synthesis;coupling coefficient;causality arguments;continuous layer-peeling algorithm;discrete layer-peeling algorithm","","252","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown that the same analysis also applies to the QAM, FSK, and PAM CRLBs for frequency offset estimation. The ratio of the modulated to the unmodulated CRLBs is derived for all QAM, PSK, and PAM signals and calculated for specific cases of interest. This is useful to determine the limiting performance of synchronization circuits for coherent receivers without the need to simulate particular algorithms. The hounds are compared to the existing true CRLBs for an unmodulated carrier wave (CW), BPSK, and QPSK. We investigated new and existing QAM phase estimation algorithms in order to verify the new phase CRLB. This showed that new minimum distance estimator performs close to the QAM bound and provides a large improvement over the power law estimator at moderate to high signal-to-noise ratios.","1558-0857","","10.1109/26.950345","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=950345","","Quadrature amplitude modulation;Frequency estimation;Phase estimation;Phase shift keying;Frequency shift keying;Amplitude estimation;AWGN channels;Frequency synchronization;Circuit simulation;Binary phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation;AWGN channels;synchronisation;quadrature phase shift keying;frequency shift keying;phase estimation;frequency estimation;pulse amplitude modulation;receivers","Cramer-Rao lower bounds;QAM;phase estimation;frequency estimation;CRLB;phase offset;quadrature amplitude modulation;PSK;PAM signals;AWGN channels;FSK;frequency offset;modulated CRLB;unmodulated CRLB;performance;synchronization circuits;coherent receivers;unmodulated carrier wave;BPSK;QPSK;minimum distance estimator;signal-to-noise ratio","","107","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A new base integration approach is presented which decouples the structural and thermal features of the HBT from the CMOS. The trend is to use this approach for future SiGe technologies for easier migration to advanced CMOS technology generations. Lateral and vertical scaling are used to achieve smaller and faster SiGe HBT devices with greatly increased current densities. Improving both the f/sub T/ and f/sub MAX/ will be a significant challenge as the collector and base dopant concentrations are increased.

We then use the differences between two prototypes to define an axis of transformation, such as younger to older. By applying these changes to a given input face, we can change its apparent age, race, or gender. Psychological investigations reveal a limitation with existing methods that's particularly apparent when changing the age of faces.

This is then reviewed and modified by a second algorithm that removes spurious gait estimates, and determines gait event times. These gait event times are known to the system within approximately one-half of a gait cycle. The resulting gait event detection system was successfully evaluated on three subjects. Detection accuracy is not adversely affected by day-to-day gait variability. This work resolved technical and practical issues that previously limited the real time application of these methods.

It is found that by properly embedding a pair of narrow slots in the ground plane of a microstrip antenna, the antenna's fundamental resonant frequency can be lowered. Reduced antenna size at a fixed frequency can thus be achieved. Moreover, enhanced bandwidth and gain for the proposed design are also observed, which is different from that observed for compact designs with a slotted radiating patch (see Wong, K.L. and Yang, K.P., Electron.

"Time-frequency parameters of the surface myoelectric signal for assessing muscle fatigue during cyclic dynamic contractions","P. Bonato; S. H. Roy; M. Knaflitz; C. J. de Luca","NeuroMuscular Res. Center, Boston Univ., MA, USA; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","","2001","48","7","745","753","The time-dependent shift in the spectral content of the surface myoelectric signal to lower frequencies has proven to be a useful tool for assessing localized muscle fatigue. Unfortunately, the technique has been restricted to constant-force, isometric contractions because of limitations in the processing methods used to obtain spectral estimates. A novel approach is proposed for calculating spectral parameters from the surface myoelectric signal during cyclic dynamic contractions. The procedure was developed using Cohen class time-frequency transforms to define the instantaneous median and mean frequency during cyclic dynamic contractions. Changes in muscle length, force, and electrode position contribute to the nonstationarity of the surface myoelectric signal. These factors, unrelated to localized fatigue, can be constrained and isolated for cyclic dynamic contractions, where they are assumed to be constant for identical phases of each cycle. Estimation errors for the instantaneous median and mean frequency are calculated from synthesized signals. It is shown that the instantaneous median frequency is affected by an error slightly lower than that related to the instantaneous mean frequency. In addition, the authors present a sample application to surface myoelectric signals recorded from the first dorsal interosseous muscle during repetitive abduction/adduction of the index finger against resistance.

No.01CH37295)","","2001","1","","513","519 vol.1","Many of the mine warfare (MM) operations performed in littoral environments face a common problem: the lack of a reliable wireless command, control and navigation channel. Coastal regions have numerous dynamic environmental factors like shallow bathymetry, acoustically reflective boundaries, wave and tide action, and marine growth that can render conventional acoustic communication and navigation systems ineffective. Alternate system technologies such as laser and seismic-based systems have been evaluated with limited success. The lack of a reliable wireless channel can prevent the coordination of multiple systems, increasing mission time requirements and risks to personnel while reducing overall effectiveness. New system concepts for future operational use in littoral environments require reliable wireless communication and navigation. To address the needs of the MIW missions, over the past several years Coastal Systems Station (CSS), with its industrial partner Magneto-Inductive Systems Limited (MISL), has developed and refined unique magneto-inductive (MI) communication, signaling and navigation concepts and hardware that use quasi-static AC magnetic fields as the channel. The physical properties of magnetic fields enable these systems to operate through any natural medium or medium boundary. The MI channel can provide seamless coverage of littoral MIW operations in shallow water, surf and beach zones. CSS/MISL have conducted a number of tests and evaluations of MI system hardware. The paper discusses MI technology and results to date, and concludes with proposed future efforts.","","0-933957-28-9","10.1109/OCEANS.2001.968775","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=968775","","Navigation;Sea measurements;Cascading style sheets;Hardware;Magnetic fields;Communication system control;Environmental factors;Tides;Acoustic waves;Marine technology","electromagnetic induction;navigation;telecommunication signalling;magnetic fields","magneto-inductive communications;mine warfare;littoral environments;wireless command control and navigation channel;coastal regions;dynamic environmental factors;shallow bathymetry;acoustically reflective boundaries;wave action;tide action;marine growth;wireless communication;wireless navigation;Magneto-Inductive Systems Limited;Coastal Systems Station;signaling;quasi-static AC magnetic fields;shallow water;surf zone;beaches;MI system hardware","","53","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Using Bayes belief networks in industrial FMEA modeling and analysis","B. H. Lee","Stanford Univ., Palo Alto, CA, USA","Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium. 2001 Proceedings. International Symposium on Product Quality and Integrity (Cat. No.01CH37179)","","2001","","","7","15","This paper presents the use of Bayes probabilistic networks as a new methodology for encoding design failure modes and effects analysis (BN-FMEA) models of mechatronic systems. The method employs established Bayesian belief network theory to construct probabilistic directed acyclic graph (DAG) models which represent causal and statistical dependencies between system-internal and -external (customer and world) state and event variables of the physical system. A new class of severity variables is also defined. Root probabilities and conditional probability and severity utility tables are generated and attached to the graph structure for use in inferencing and design trade-off evaluation. BN-FMEA provides a language for design teams to articulate-with greater precision and consistency and less ambiguity-physical system failure cause-effect relationships, and the uncertainty about their impact on customers and the world. Demonstration software developed at Stanford illustrates how BN-FMEA can be applied to FMEA modeling of an inkjet printer. The software supports knowledge acquisition of BN-FMEA models, and generates from the belief net model criticality matrices and Pareto charts conformant with established FMEA standards such as SAE 1998. The approach supports traditional design FMEA objectives, identification of system failure modes, and provides improved knowledge representation and inferencing power. Limitations of the BN-FMEA methodology are also discussed. Finally, BN-FMEB is presented as a basis for improved integration of design and diagnostic modeling of mechatronic systems.","0149-144X","0-7803-6615-8","10.1109/RAMS.2001.902434","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=902434","","Power system modeling;Mechatronics;Probability;Encoding;Design methodology;Failure analysis;Bayesian methods;Network theory (graphs);Uncertainty;Printers","failure analysis;belief networks;ink jet printers;mechatronics;software reliability;knowledge acquisition","Bayes belief networks;industrial FMEA modeling;industrial FMEA analysis;Bayes probabilistic networks;design failure modes encoding;mechatronic systems;Bayesian belief network theory;probabilistic directed acyclic graph models;statistical dependencies;causal dependencies;root probabilities;conditional probability;severity utility tables;graph structure;design trade-off evaluation;physical system failure cause-effect relationships;uncertainty;Stanford;inkjet printer;knowledge acquisition;belief net model;criticality matrices;Pareto charts;system failure modes identification;diagnostic modeling","","22","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paper presents the results from an in-depth study of the interdependencies within 5 distinct sets of requirements, each including 20 high-priority requirements of 5 distinct products from 5 different companies. The results show that: (1) roughly 20% of the requirements are responsible for 75% of the interdependencies; (2) only a few requirements are singular; (3) customer-specific bespoke development tend to include more functionality- related dependencies whereas market-driven product development have an emphasis on value-related dependencies. Several strategies for reducing the effort needed for identifying and managing interdependencies are outlined. A technique for visualization of interdependencies with the aim of supporting release planning is also discussed. The complexity of requirements interdependency analysis is studied in relation to metrics of requirements coupling.

In the proposed study some aspects of the quality of power supplied to the customers will be dealt with taking into consideration slow voltage variations. In this regard the effect of dispersed generation (DG) on the voltage profile of a LV distribution feeder has been examined. With reference to a different kind of load distribution along the line, analytical expressions have been derived to determine the limit value of the power that can be injected into the distribution network without causing overvoltages. These expressions have been developed under some simplifying hypothesis related both to the DG unit and to the distribution network.","","0-7803-7139-9","10.1109/PTC.2001.964845","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=964845","","Intelligent networks;Distributed power generation;Power supplies;Power generation;Photovoltaic systems;Voltage control;Dispersion;Solar power generation;Substations;Power system protection","photovoltaic power systems;electric power generation;power supply quality;power distribution control;voltage control","PV generation;voltage profile;LV distribution networks;dispersed generation;power quality;steady-state analysis;voltage control;voltage drop calculation;linear load distribution","","31","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

CDNs deploy a set of servers distributed throughout the Internet and replicate provider content across these servers for better performance and availability than centralized provider servers. Existing work on CDNs has primarily focused on techniques for efficiently redirecting user requests to appropriate CDN servers to reduce request latency and balance load. However, little attention has been given to the development of placement strategies for Web server replicas to further improve CDN performance. We explore the problem of Web server replica placement in detail. We develop several placement algorithms that use workload information, such as client latency and request rates, to make informed placement decisions. We then evaluate the placement algorithms using both synthetic and real network topologies, as well as Web server traces, and show that the placement of Web replicas is crucial to CDN performance. We also address a number of practical issues when using these algorithms, such as their sensitivity to imperfect knowledge about client workload and network topology, the stability of the input data, and methods for obtaining the input.","0743-166X","0-7803-7016-3","10.1109/INFCOM.2001.916655","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=916655","","Web server;Delay;Network servers;Network topology;Internet;Telecommunication traffic;Bandwidth;Cost function;Availability;Stability","file servers;Internet;replica techniques;performance evaluation;network topology;stability;graph theory","placement algorithms;content distribution networks;Web content providers;hosting services;Internet;availability;request latency reduction;load balancing;workload information;Web server replica placement;client latency;request rates;real network topology;synthetic network topology;Web server traces;CDN performance;network topology;client workload;input data stability;World Wide Web;graph theory","","163","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the higher voltage and higher power areas, the invention and improvements of gate turnoff thyristors (GTOs), insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), and integrated gate-commutated thyristors (IGCTs) have led to other unique topologies to take advantage of these devices.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.931484","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=931484","","Power electronics;DC-DC power converters;Switching circuits;Thyristors;Insulated gate bipolar transistors;Analog-digital conversion;Defense industry;Stress;RLC circuits;Resonance","DC-DC power convertors;DC-AC power convertors;AC-DC power convertors;AC-AC power convertors;thyristor convertors;insulated gate bipolar transistors;MOS-controlled thyristors;switching circuits","power electronic converter technology;AC-AC converter;DC-AC converter;DC-DC converter;AC-DC converter;military applications;industrial applications;commercial applications;soft switching;power device switching stresses reduction;circuit resonances;gate turnoff thyristors;insulated gate bipolar transistors;GTO;IGBT;integrated gate-commutated thyristors;IGCT","","12","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Univ., China; NA","IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","","2001","12","6","1358","1366","An important issue in the design and implementation of a neural network is the sensitivity of its output to input and weight perturbations. In this paper, we discuss the sensitivity of the most popular and general feedforward neural networks-multilayer perceptron (MLP). The sensitivity is defined as the mathematical expectation of the output errors of the MLP due to input and weight perturbations with respect to all input and weight values in a given continuous interval. The sensitivity for a single neuron is discussed first and an analytical expression that is a function of the absolute values of input and weight perturbations is approximately derived. Then an algorithm is given to compute the sensitivity for the entire MLP. As intuitively expected, the sensitivity increases with input and weight perturbations, but the increase has an upper bound that is determined by the structural configuration of the MLP, namely the number of neurons per layer and the number of layers. There exists an optimal value for the number of neurons in a layer, which yields the highest sensitivity value. The effect caused by the number of layers is quite unexpected. The sensitivity of a neural network may decrease at first and then almost keeps constant while the number increases.","1941-0093","","10.1109/72.963772","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=963772","","Sensitivity analysis;Multilayer perceptrons;Neural networks;Neurons;Stochastic processes;Multi-layer neural network;Feedforward neural networks;Upper bound;Neural network hardware;Guidelines","sensitivity analysis;feedforward neural nets;multilayer perceptrons","multilayer perceptron;input perturbations;neural network;weight perturbations;feedforward neural networks;single neuron;upper bound;sensitivity analysis","","74","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On the other hand, perceptually uniform spaces, such as L*a*b*, as well as approximately-uniform color spaces, such as HSV, exist, in which measured color differences are proportional to the human perception of such differences. This paper compares RGB with L*a*b* and HSV in terms of their effectiveness in color texture analysis. There has been a limited but increasing amount of work on the color aspects of textured images. The results have shown that incorporating color into a texture analysis and recognition scheme can be very important and beneficial. The presented methodology uses a family of Gabor filters specially tuned to measure specific orientations and sizes within each color texture. Effectiveness is measured by the classification performance of each color space, as well as by classifier-independent measures. Experimental results are obtained with a variety of color texture Images. Perceptually uniform spaces are shown to outperform RGB in many cases.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.923289","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=923289","","Image color analysis;Image texture analysis;Image processing;Humans;Gabor filters;Extraterrestrial measurements;Colored noise;Image analysis;Size measurement;Filtering","visual perception;image texture;image colour analysis;image recognition;filtering theory;image classification","perceptually uniform color spaces;color texture analysis;RGB;nonuniform color space;image processing;color representation;approximately-uniform color spaces;HSV;color differences;L*a*b*;image recognition;Gabor filters;classification performance;color space;classifier-independent measures;image classification","","175","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Second, by making use of the two-dimensional ray-tracing results, a new three-dimensional (3D) propagation-prediction model is developed, which can save 99% of the computation time of a traditional three-dimensional model. This new hybrid model is more accurate than two-dimensional models, and more efficient in computing the path loss to any point in the building than traditional three-dimensional models. In this model, reflection and refraction by layered materials, and diffraction for the corners of the walls, are considered.

In this paper the saliency or impedance difference is used as the conventional methods and, nevertheless, in order to amplify the difference containing the information of the rotor angle and to maintain a reasonable performance under any load condition, a high frequency injection scheme is proposed. A speed and position estimation scheme based on the characteristics of the high frequency impedance is proposed. The scheme extracts the high frequency impedance components related to the rotor position. An initial angle estimation scheme for the starting from an arbitrary rotor position is also proposed.

This is made possible through the use of predictive reliability assessment tools that are able to predict customer reliability characteristics based on system topology and component reliability data. Reliability software predicts expected interruption frequencies and duration in a manner analogous to current and voltage evaluations in traditional power flow models.

Software time delays are also provided for summing up received signals of each channel. Theoretical discussions indicate the impact of the time delay capability on the bandwidth and sensitivity improvement of a transducer array for guided wave generation. Determination of both physical and software time delay values is based on a knowledge of dispersion curves and element spacing. Based on reference signals, a non-knowledge-based automatic time-delay searching algorithm was introduced for guided wave mode selection. Experiments were conducted with a phased comb transducer array mounted on a carbon steel pipe. The experimental results show that signal to noise ratio has been greatly improved by use of the time-delay system. Some other benefits of the phased array, including unidirection generation and mode control flexibility, are discussed.","1525-8955","","10.1109/58.920708","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=920708","","Transducers;Delay effects;Phased arrays;Control systems;Energy resolution;Signal resolution;Bandwidth;Chemical elements;Steel;Signal to noise ratio","ultrasonic transducer arrays;delays;acoustic waveguides;ultrasonic materials testing;ultrasonic dispersion;array signal processing;acoustic signal processing;frequency response","guided wave mode control;phased transducer array;multichannel time-delay system;high energy controllable tone-burst signals;independent channels;arbitrary time delays;software time delays;dispersion curves;element spacing;reference signals;automatic time-delay searching algorithm;mode selection;phased comb transducer array;carbon steel pipe;improved signal to noise ratio;unidirection generation;mode control flexibility;US NDT;frequency response","","110","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Typical scales of interest span hundreds of wavelengths. This paper presents a simplified derivation of the k-space method for a medium of variable sound speed and density; the derivation clearly shows the relationship of this k-space method to both past k-space methods and pseudospectral methods. In the present method, the spatial differential equations are solved by a simple Fourier transform method, and temporal iteration is performed using a k-t space propagator. The temporal iteration procedure is shown to be exact for homogeneous media, unconditionally stable for ""slow"" (c(x)/spl les/c/sub 0/) media, and highly accurate for general weakly scattering media. The applicability of the k-space method to large-scale soft tissue modeling is shown by simulating two-dimensional propagation of an incident plane wave through several tissue-mimicking cylinders as well as a model chest wall cross section. A three-dimensional implementation of the k-space method is also employed for the example problem of propagation through a tissue-mimicking sphere. Numerical results indicate that the k-space method is accurate for large-scale soft tissue computations with much greater efficiency than that of an analogous leapfrog pseudospectral method or a 2-4 finite difference time-domain method. However, numerical results also indicate that the k-space method is less accurate than the finite-difference method for a high contrast scatterer with bone-like properties, although qualitative results can still be obtained by the k-space method with high efficiency. Possible extensions to the method, including representation of absorption effects, absorbing boundary conditions, elastic-wave propagation, and acoustic nonlinearity, are discussed.","1525-8955","","10.1109/58.911717","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=911717","","Large-scale systems;Acoustic propagation;Ultrasonic imaging;Acoustic scattering;Biological tissues;Finite difference methods;Differential equations;Fourier transforms;Time domain analysis;Absorption","ultrasonic propagation;Fourier transforms;iterative methods;biological tissues;bioacoustics;biomedical ultrasonics","k-space method;large-scale models;wave propagation;tissue;ultrasonic pulse propagation;inhomogeneous tissue;ultrasound-tissue interaction;imaging methods;spatial differential equations;Fourier transform method;temporal iteration;k-t space propagator;homogeneous media;general weakly scattering media;two-dimensional propagation;tissue-mimicking cylinders;model chest wall cross section;three-dimensional implementation;tissue-mimicking sphere;efficiency;absorption effects;absorbing boundary conditions;elastic-wave propagation;acoustic nonlinearity","Adipose Tissue;Algorithms;Biomedical Engineering;Humans;Models, Biological;Scattering, Radiation;Ultrasonography","92","","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For most users, the Internet is simply a connection to these applications. They are shielded from the details of how the Internet works, through the-information-hiding principles of the Internet protocol stack, which dictates how user-level data is transformed into network packets for transport across the network and put back together for delivery at the receiving application. For many networking researchers however, the protocols themselves are of interest. Using specialized network measurement hardware or software, these researchers collect information about network packet transmissions. With detailed packet-level measurements and some knowledge of the IP stack, they can use reverse engineering to gather significant information about both the application structure and user behavior, which can be applied to a variety of tasks like network troubleshooting, protocol debugging, workload characterization, and performance evaluation and improvement.

Furthermore, the PID parameters can be adjusted while the motor is running, so that online adjustment is achieved. This avoids shutting-down the system, re-assembling and re-compiling the source code each time the PID parameters are adjusted.

Udupa","Dept. of Radiol., Pennsylvania Univ., Philadelphia, PA, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","","2001","23","7","689","706","Thresholding is a popular image segmentation method that converts a gray-level image into a binary image. The selection of optimum thresholds has remained a challenge over decades. Besides being a segmentation tool on its own, often it is also a step in many advanced image segmentation techniques in spaces other than the image space. We introduce a thresholding method that accounts for both intensity-based class uncertainty-a histogram-based property-and region homogeneity-an image morphology-based property. A scale-based formulation is used for region homogeneity computation. At any threshold, intensity-based class uncertainty is computed by fitting a Gaussian to the intensity distribution of each of the two regions segmented at that threshold. The theory of the optimum thresholding method is based on the postulate that objects manifest themselves with fuzzy boundaries in any digital image acquired by an imaging device. The main idea here is to select that threshold at which pixels with high class uncertainty accumulate mostly around object boundaries. To achieve this, a threshold energy criterion is formulated using class-uncertainty and region homogeneity such that, at any image location, a high energy is created when both class uncertainty and region homogeneity are high or both are low. Finally, the method selects that threshold which corresponds to the minimum overall energy. The method has been compared to a maximum segmented image information method. Superiority of the proposed method was observed both qualitatively on clinical medical images as well as quantitatively on 250 realistic phantom images generated by adding different degrees of blurring, noise, and background variation to real objects segmented from clinical images.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.935844","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=935844","","Uncertainty;Image segmentation;Image converters;Distributed computing;Digital images;Biomedical imaging;Imaging phantoms;Image generation;Background noise;Noise generators","image segmentation;probability;entropy;Gaussian noise;medical image processing;mathematical morphology","optimum image thresholding;region homogeneity;gray-level image;binary image;intensity-based class uncertainty;histogram-based property;image morphology-based property;scale-based formulation;fuzzy boundaries;threshold energy criterion;blurring;background variation;clinical medical images","","137","","39","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

According to our data, the model is fully applicable from 0 to 2 THz while including lines up to 10 THz. Its primary goal is to simulate the millimeter/submillimeter region accessible from the ground (frequencies up to /spl sim/2 THz at most, with a few windows between 1 and 2 THz accessible only under exceptional conditions at very dry sites). Line-by-line calculations of the absorption are performed using a line database generated from the latest available spectroscopic constants for all relevant atmospheric species. The collisional line widths are obtained from published laboratory data. The excess of absorption in the longwave range that cannot be explained by the line spectrum is modeled by introducing two different continuum-like terms based on FTS measurements between 170 and 1100 GHz: collision-induced absorption of the dry atmosphere due to transient dipoles in symmetric molecules (N/sub 2/ and O/sub 2/) and continuum-like water vapor opacity. All H/sub 2/O lines up to 10 THz are included in order to correctly account for the entire H/sub 2/O far-wing opacity below 2 THz for a given line-shape. Hence, this contribution does not need to be part of a pseudocontinuum term below that frequency cutoff (still necessary, as shown in this paper) in contrast to other models used to date. Phase delays near H/sub 2/O and O/sub 2/ resonances are also important for ground-based astronomy since they affect interferometric phase. The frequency-dependent dispersive phase delay function is formally related to the absorption line shape via the Kramers-Kronig dispersion theory, and this relation has been used for modeling those delays. Precise calculations of phase delays are essential for the future Atacama large millimeter array (ALMA) project. A software package called atmospheric transmission at microwaves (ATM) has been developed to provide the radioastronomy and aeronomy communities with an updated tool to compute the atmospheric spectrum in clear-sky conditions for various scientific applications. We use this model to provide detailed simulations of atmospheric transmission and phase dispersion for several sites suitable for submillimeter astronomy.","1558-2221","","10.1109/8.982447","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=982447","","Atmospheric modeling;Delay;Absorption;Atmospheric measurements;Frequency;Astronomy;Dispersion;Phased arrays;Microwave propagation;Microwave measurements","atmospheric electromagnetic wave propagation;microwave propagation;astronomy computing;software tools;delays;spectroscopy computing;millimetre wave antennas;upper atmosphere;reviews;atmospheric techniques","atmospheric transmission;microwave transmission;millimeter/submillimeter applications;longwave atmospheric spectrum;broadband measurements;line database;spectroscopic constants;atmospheric species;collisional line;laboratory data;longwave range;line spectrum;FTS measurements;collision-induced absorption;dry atmosphere;transient dipoles;symmetric molecules;continuum-like water vapor opacity;frequency cutoff;phase delays;ground-based astronomy;frequency-dependent dispersive phase delay function;absorption line shape;Kramers-Kronig dispersion theory;Atacama large millimeter array;ALMA project;software package;atmospheric transmission at microwaves;radioastronomy;aeronomy;scientific applications;simulations;phase dispersion;submillimeter astronomy;0 to 2 THz;10 THz;H/sub 2/O;O/sub 2/;N/sub 2/","","196","","63","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The conventional SEPIC converter was primarily designed to provide a nonpulsating input current, operating with both inductors in continuous current mode and only DC-DC conversion was considered. The modified SEPIC converter is designed to operate as an AC-DC converter and can be viewed as a cascade of a modified boost converter and a buck-boost converter. The boost converter operates in discontinuous current mode, while the buck-boost converter operates in continuous current mode. Since a high power factor is naturally achieved in this way, a simple feedback control technique is needed in order to regulate the output voltage.

The automatic generation control (AGC) loop addresses this objective by using system load and electrical frequency samples to periodically update the set-point power for key ""swing"" generators with a control sample rate ranging from 1 to 10 min. To improve performance, emerging AGC strategies employ a look-ahead control algorithm that requires real-time estimates of the system's future load out to several samples using a one to ten minute sample period. This paper describes a strategy for developing a very short-term load predictor using slow and fast Kalman estimators and an hourly forecaster. The Kalman model parameters are determined by matching the frequency response of the estimator to the load residuals. The design strategy is applied to the system operated by the Bonneville Power Administration and specific performance and sensitivity studies are presented.","1558-0865","","10.1109/87.911377","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=911377","","Automatic generation control;Control systems;Power generation;Kalman filters;Automatic control;Real time systems;Load forecasting;Power system modeling;Frequency response;Frequency estimation","power generation control;load forecasting;frequency response;Kalman filters;sensitivity analysis;parameter estimation;real-time systems","short-term prediction;power-system generation;power-system control;automatic generation control;look-ahead control;Kalman estimators;parameter estimation;frequency response;sensitivity analysis;load forecasting","","72","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For the practical application of electric scooters, the control scheme uses only one current sensor to measure the DC bus current to achieve torque control, instead of two current sensors for three phase currents. Also three position Hall sensors are used to perform phase advance control and field weakening control, instead of an expensive encoder.

On the other hand, conventional particle filter, e.g., CONDENSATION, uses transition prior as the proposal distribution. The transition prior does not take into account current observation data, and many particles can therefore be wasted in low likelihood area. To overcome these difficulties, unscented particle filter (UPF) has recently been proposed in the field of filtering theory. In this paper, we introduce the UPF framework into audio and visual tracking. The UPF uses the unscented Kalman filter to generate sophisticated proposal distributions that seamlessly integrate the current observation, thus greatly improving the tracking performance. To evaluate the efficacy of the UPF framework, we apply it in two real-world tracking applications. One is the audio-based speaker localization, and the other is the vision-based human tracking. The experimental results are compared against those of the widely used CONDENSATION approach and have demonstrated superior tracking performance.","1063-6919","0-7695-1272-0","10.1109/CVPR.2001.991045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=991045","","Proposals;Particle tracking;Particle filters;Humans;State-space methods;Filtering;Face;Equations;Acoustic noise;Working environment noise","tracking;Kalman filters;filtering theory;object detection;object recognition","Kalman filters;filtering theory;object tracking;audio-visual environment;unscented particle filter;unscented Kalman filter","","64","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The importance of the converter losses on efficiency optimization in medium-size drives is analyzed in this paper. Based on the experiments with a 90-kW drive, it is found that it is not critical if the converter losses are neglected in the control, except that the robustness toward load disturbances may unnecessarily be reduced.

We segment a continuous human activity into separate actions and correctly identify each action. The camera views the subject from the lateral view: there are no distinct breaks or pauses between the execution of different actions. We have no prior knowledge about the commencement or termination of each action. We compute the angles subtended by three major components of the body with the vertical axis, namely the torso, the upper component of the leg and the lower component of the leg. Using these three angles as a feature vector we classify frames into breakpoint and non-breakpoint frames. Breakpoints indicate an action's commencement or termination. We use single action sequences for the training data set. The test sequences, on the other hand are continuous sequences of human activity that consist of three or more actions in succession. The system has been tested on continuous activity sequences containing actions such as walking, sitting down, standing up, bending, getting up, squatting and rising. It detects the breakpoints and classifies the actions between them.","","0-7695-1293-3","10.1109/EVENT.2001.938863","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=938863","","Humans;Torso;Legged locomotion;Leg;Computer vision;Cameras;Training data;System testing;Forward contracts","image recognition;image segmentation;image sequences;image classification;feature extraction","continuous human activity segmentation;continuous human activity recognition;automatic segmentation;automatic recognition;camera;torso;feature vector;frame classification;breakpoint frames;nonbreakpoint frames;single action sequences;training data set;test sequences","","68","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To understand the effectiveness of the soft-switching technique, when applied to electric vehicle (EV) and hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) systems, it may be necessary to first evaluate their system requirements and performance. This evaluation process would require knowledge of the vehicle dynamics. The vehicle load requires a special torque-speed profile from the drivetrain for minimum power ratings to meet the vehicle's operational constraints, such as initial acceleration and gradability. The selection of motor and its control for EV and HEV applications are dictated mainly by this special torque-speed requirement. As a consequence, this requirement will have a strong influence on the converter operation. This paper makes an attempt to evaluate EV and HEV running in both standard Federal Test Procedure 1975 city driving and highway driving cycles. A simplified analysis is carried out for several of the most commonly used electric motors operating on the optimal torque-speed profile. Special attention is given to the converter conduction and switching losses, by analyzing the switching losses, and by assuming that an ideal soft-switching scheme will have zero switching losses, one can evaluate the improvement in the system efficiency if a soft-switching control is used. The relative significance of soft switching for EV and HEV systems is then established.","1557-9948","","10.1109/41.904559","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=904559","","Hybrid electric vehicles;Motor drives;Switching loss;Switches;Vehicle driving;Stress;Vehicle dynamics;Acceleration;Torque control;Testing","electric vehicles;switching circuits;reluctance motors;machine control;torque control;power convertors;losses","soft switching;HEV motor drives;EV motor drives;hybrid electric vehicle;electric vehicle;switch stresses reduction;vehicle dynamics;torque-speed profile;drivetrain;minimum power ratings;initial acceleration;gradability;torque-speed requirement;Federal Test Procedure 1975;city driving;highway driving;optimal torque-speed profile;switching losses;conduction losses;zero switching losses;system efficiency improvement;torque control;power converters","","34","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However the intrinsic body diode is required to conduct in order to create the ZVS turn-on rendition for the power MOSFET. Due to the extremely low reverse voltage, the reverse recovery charges might not be swept out before turning off the MOSFET. Therefore, the body diode might be subjected to the dv/dt stress when it is not yet capable of blocking reverse voltage. Also, not able to maintain the ZVS operation at low load will force the on-state MOSFET to turn off at hard-switching condition. Like in the hard-switched full bridge topology, the cdv/dt shoot-through current might produce a voltage spike at the gate of the off-state MOSFET on the same leg and cause devices failure. Several silicon technologies are presented to resolve the above-mentioned failure modes in the ZVS topology. Fast reverse recovery time and better dv/dt ruggedness make this new MOSFET technology suitable for higher frequency ZVS full-bridge applications. Inherent with extremely high silicon density and low gate charge, these new MOSFETs can reduce the component count with the same or better performance and will enable much higher power density for the next generation telecom/server SMPS designs.","","0-7803-6618-2","10.1109/APEC.2001.912525","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=912525","","MOSFET circuits;Zero voltage switching;Topology;Bridge circuits;Diodes;Power MOSFET;Silicon;Switching loss;Switching frequency;Low voltage","switched mode power supplies;power MOSFET;switching circuits;bridge circuits;failure analysis","MOSFET failure modes;zero-voltage-switching;full-bridge switching mode power supply;phase-shifted zero-voltage-switching;low switching losses;power devices;higher switching frequency;intrinsic body diode;ZVS turn-on rendition;power MOSFET;low reverse voltage;reverse recovery charges;MOSFET turn off;low load;hard-switching condition;shoot-through current;voltage spike;silicon technologies;reverse recovery time;high silicon density;low gate charge;component count reduction;telecom/server SMPS designs","","42","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While many mechanisms for range estimation exist, any individual mode of sensing can be blocked or confused by the environment. We present and analyze an acoustic ranging system that performs well in the presence of many types of interference, but can return incorrect measurements in non-line-of-sight conditions.

This mobility middleware should dynamically reallocate and trace mobile users and terminals and permit communication and coordination of mobile entities. In addition, open and untrusted environments must overcome system heterogeneity and grant the appropriate security level. Solutions to these issues require compliance with standards to interoperate with different systems and legacy components and a reliable security infrastructure based on standard cryptographic mechanisms and tools. Many proposals suggest using mobile agent technology middleware to address these issues. A mobile agent moves entities in execution together with code and achieved state, making it possible to upgrade distributed computing environments without suspending service. We propose three mobile computing services: user virtual environment (UVE), mobile virtual terminal (MVT), and virtual resource management (VRM). UVE provides users with a uniform view of their working environments independent of current locations and specific terminals. MVT extends traditional terminal mobility by preserving the terminal execution state for restoration at new locations, including active processes and subscribed services. VRM permits mobile users and terminals to maintain access to resources and services by automatically requalifying the bindings and moving specific resources or services to permit load balancing and replication.","1558-0814","","10.1109/2.910896","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910896","","Mobile agents;Middleware;Mobile computing;Communication system security;Protocols;Mobile communication;Cryptography;Proposals;Distributed computing;Virtual environment","client-server systems;mobile computing;distributed object management","mobile computing;mobile agent middleware;protocols;cryptographic mechanisms;distributed computing environments;user virtual environment;mobile virtual terminal;virtual resource management;terminal execution state;mobile users;mobile terminals;load balancing;replication","","119","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

SUP was spawned from an effort started in the IETF Signaling Transport (Sigtrans) working group to develop a specialized transport protocol for call control signaling in voice-overt (VoIP) networks. Recognizing that other applications could use some of the new protocol's capabilities, the IETF now embraces SCTP as a general-purpose transport layer protocol, joining TCP and UDP above the IP layer. Like TCP, STCP offers a point-to-point, connection-oriented, reliable delivery transport service for applications communicating over an IP network.","1941-0131","","10.1109/4236.968833","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=968833","","Transport protocols;TCPIP;IP networks;Application software;Telecommunication network reliability;Force control;Internet;Joining processes;Communication system control;Error correction","transport protocols;telecommunication standards;Internet;telecommunication congestion control;system recovery","SCTP;TCP/IP suite;transmission control protocol;user datagram protocol;UDP;transport layer functionality;Internet Engineering Task Force;stream control transmission protocol;proposed standard;IETF Signaling Transport;Sigtrans working group;specialized transport protocol;call control signaling;voice-over-IP networks;VoIP networks;general-purpose transport layer protocol;IP layer;point-to-point connection-oriented reliable delivery transport service","","83","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
"A multicarrier system based on the fractional Fourier transform for time-frequency-selective channels","M. Martone","WJ Commun. Inc., San Jose, CA, USA","IEEE Transactions on Communications","","2001","49","6","1011","1020","Traditional multicarrier techniques perform a frequency-domain decomposition of a channel characterized by frequency-selective distortion in a plurality of subchannels that are affected by frequency flat distortion. The distortion in each independent subchannel can then be easily compensated by simple gain and phase adjustments. Typically, digital Fourier transform schemes make the implementation of the multicarrier system feasible and attractive with respect to single-carrier systems. However, when the channel is time-frequency-selective, as it usually happens in the rapidly fading wireless channel, this traditional methodology fails. Since the channel frequency response is rapidly time-varying, the optimal transmission/reception methodology should be able to process nonstationary signals. In other words, the subchannel carrier frequencies should be time-varying and ideally decompose the frequency distortion of the channel perfectly at any instant in time. However, this ideally optimal approach presents significant challenges both in terms of conceptual and computational complexity. The idea disclosed in this work is that a nonstationary approach can be approximated using signal bases that are especially suited for the analysis/synthesis of nonstationary signals. We propose in fact the use of a multicarrier system that employs orthogonal signal bases of the chirp type that in practice correspond to the fractional Fourier transform signal basis. The significance of the methodology relies on the important practical consideration that analysis/synthesis methods of the fractional Fourier type can be implemented with a complexity that is equivalent to the traditional fast Fourier transform.","1558-0857","","10.1109/26.930631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=930631","","Fourier transforms;Signal synthesis;Phase distortion;Fading;Frequency response;Signal processing;Computational complexity;Signal analysis;Chirp;Fast Fourier transforms","discrete Fourier transforms;fading channels;time-varying channels;dispersive channels;chirp modulation;land mobile radio","multicarrier system;fractional Fourier transform;time-frequency-selective channels;frequency-domain decomposition;frequency-selective distortion;subchannels;frequency flat distortion;digital Fourier transform;rapidly fading wireless channel;channel frequency response;optimal transmission/reception methodology;nonstationary signals;subchannel carrier frequencies;frequency distortion;complexity;signal bases;analysis/synthesis;chirp;fractional Fourier transform signal basis;high mobility radio communication","","114","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Unconstrained receding-horizon control of nonlinear systems","A. Jadbabaie; J. Yu; J. Hauser","Control & Dynamical Syst., California Inst. of Technol., Pasadena, CA, USA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","","2001","46","5","776","783","It is well known that unconstrained infinite-horizon optimal control may be used to construct a stabilizing controller for a nonlinear system. We show that similar stabilization results may be achieved using unconstrained finite horizon optimal control. The key idea is to approximate the tail of the infinite horizon cost-to-go using, as terminal cost, an appropriate control Lyapunov function. Roughly speaking, the terminal control Lyapunov function (CLF) should provide an (incremental) upper bound on the cost. In this fashion, important stability characteristics may be retained without the use of terminal constraints such as those employed by a number of other researchers. The absence of constraints allows a significant speedup in computation. Furthermore, it is shown that in order to guarantee stability, it suffices to satisfy an improvement property, thereby relaxing the requirement that truly optimal trajectories be found. We provide a complete analysis of the stability and region of attraction/operation properties of receding horizon control strategies that utilize finite horizon approximations in the proposed class. It is shown that the guaranteed region of operation contains that of the CLF controller and may be made as large as desired by increasing the optimization horizon (restricted, of course, to the infinite horizon domain). Moreover, it is easily seen that both CLF and infinite-horizon optimal control approaches are limiting cases of our receding horizon strategy. The key results are illustrated using a familiar example, the inverted pendulum, where significant improvements in guaranteed region of operation and cost are noted.","1558-2523","","10.1109/9.920800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=920800","","Nonlinear control systems;Control systems;Nonlinear systems;Optimal control;Infinite horizon;Cost function;Lyapunov method;Stability;Tail;Upper bound","optimal control;stability;Lyapunov methods;nonlinear control systems;control system synthesis","unconstrained receding-horizon control;unconstrained finite horizon optimal control;infinite horizon cost-to-go;terminal cost;control Lyapunov function;stability characteristics;region of attraction;guaranteed region of operation;inverted pendulum","","185","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Surface mount technology (SMT) decoupling capacitors are commonly used to mitigate this power-bus noise. A critical design issue associated with this common practice in high-speed digital designs is placement of the capacitors with respect to the integrated circuits (ICs). Local decoupling, namely, placing SMT capacitors in proximity to ICs, is investigated in this study. Multilayer PCB designs that employ entire layers or area fills for power and ground in a parallel plate structure are considered. The results demonstrate that local decoupling can provide high-frequency benefits for certain PCB geometries through mutual inductive coupling between closely spaced vias. The associated magnetic flux linkage is between the power and ground layers. Numerical modeling using an integral equation formulation with circuit extraction is used to quantify the local decoupling phenomenon. Local decoupling can effectively reduce high-frequency power-bus noise, though placing capacitors adjacent to ICs may limit routing flexibility, and tradeoffs need to be made based on design requirements. Design curves are generated as a function of power-bus layer thickness and SMT capacitor/IC spacing using the modeling approach to quantify the power-bus noise reduction for decoupling capacitors located adjacent to devices. Measurement data is provided to corroborate the modeling approach.","1558-187X","","10.1109/15.974639","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=974639","","Surface mounting","surface mount technology;printed circuit layout;digital circuits;integral equations;circuit noise;capacitors;electromagnetic compatibility;electromagnetic interference;power supply circuits;electromagnetic coupling","SMT decoupling capacitor placement;dc power-bus design;multilayer PCBs;device switching;signal integrity;electromagnetic interference problems;EMI problems;surface mount technology;power-bus noise;high-speed digital designs;integrated circuits;ICs;local decoupling;parallel plate structure;mutual inductive coupling;closely spaced vias;magnetic flux linkage;integral equation formulation;circuit extraction;high-frequency power-bus noise;routing flexibility;design curves;SMT capacitor/IC spacing;power-bus noise reduction","","94","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, a newly designed total sliding-mode control system, which is insensitive to uncertainties, including parameter variations and external disturbance in the whole control process, is introduced. The total sliding-mode control comprises the baseline model design and the curbing controller design. In the baseline model design, a computed torque controller is designed to cancel the nonlinearity of the nominal plant. In the curbing controller design, an additional controller is designed using a new sliding surface to ensure the sliding motion through the entire state trajectory. Therefore, in the total sliding-mode control system, the controlled system has a total sliding motion without a reaching phase. Then, to overcome the two main problems with sliding-mode control, i.e., the assumption of known uncertainty bounds and the chattering phenomena in the control effort, an RFNN sliding-mode control system is investigated to control the PM synchronous servo motor. In the RFNN sliding-mode control system, an RFNN bound observer is utilized to adjust the uncertainty bounds in real time. To guarantee the convergence of tracking error, analytical methods based on a discrete-type Lyapunov function are proposed to determine the varied learning rates of the RFNN. Simulated and experimental results due to periodic step and sinusoidal commands show that the dynamic behaviors of the proposed control systems are robust with regard to uncertainties.","1557-9948","","10.1109/41.954557","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=954557","","Sliding mode control;Servomechanisms;Motor drives;Uncertainty;Control systems;Motion control;Synchronous motors;Servomotors;Process control;Torque control","permanent magnet motors;synchronous motor drives;servomotors;variable structure systems;recurrent neural nets;fuzzy neural nets;neurocontrollers;machine vector control;control system synthesis;Lyapunov methods","total sliding-mode controller;PM synchronous servo motor drive;recurrent fuzzy neural network;dynamic responses;permanent-magnet synchronous servo motor;parameter variations;external disturbance;torque controller;curbing controller design;nonlinearity cancellation;sliding motion;state trajectory;reaching phase;uncertainty bounds;chattering phenomena;control effort;tracking error convergence;varied learning rates;discrete-type Lyapunov function;sinusoidal commands;periodic step commands;dynamic behaviors;control systems;field oriented control","","82","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The contributions of the various components of the fields, namely, static, induction, and radiation for the electric field, and induction and radiation for the magnetic field are illustrated and discussed. It is shown in particular that the presence of a tower tends, in general, to increase substantially the electric and magnetic field peaks and their derivatives. This increase is mainly caused by the presence of two oppositely propagating current wavefronts originating from the tower top and by the very high propagation velocity of current pulses within the tower, and depends essentially on the wavefront steepness of the channel-base current. Because of the last factor, the increase of the field magnitudes is found to be significantly higher for subsequent return strokes, which are characterized by much faster risetimes compared to first return strokes. The presented results are consistent with experimental observations of current in lightning strokes to the Toronto CN Tower and of the associated electric and magnetic fields measured 2 km away. These findings partially explain the fact that subsequent return strokes characterized by lower current peaks but higher front steepnesses and return stroke speeds may result in higher field peaks. The results obtained have important implications in electromagnetic (EM) compatibility. It is found that lightning strokes to tall metallic objects lead to increased EM field disturbances. Also, subsequent return strokes are to be considered an even more important source of EM interference than first return strokes. Indeed, EM fields from subsequent strokes are characterized by faster fronts and additionally, they may reach greater peaks than first strokes. Lastly, findings of this study emphasize the difficulty of extracting reliable lightning return stroke current information from remote EM field measurements using oversimplified formulae.","1558-187X","","10.1109/15.942607","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=942607","","Electromagnetic compatibility","electromagnetic compatibility;lightning;electromagnetic fields;radiofrequency interference;electric current;electromagnetic pulse;transient analysis","electromagnetic field;lightning-return stroke;tall towers;magnetic fields;static;induction;electric field;oppositely propagating current wavefronts;propagation velocity;current pulses;wavefront steepness;channel-base current;Toronto CN Tower;current peaks;electromagnetic compatibility;EM compatibility;tall metallic objects;EM field disturbances;EM interference;EMC","","197","","46","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Composition dependent structure analysis shows that an annealed FePt nanoparticle assembly with a composition around Fe/sub 55/Pt/sub 45/ will lead to the highly ordered fct phase. This Fe/sub 55/Pt/sub 45/ nanoparticle assembly yields high coercivity, and will be a candidate for future ultra-high density magnetic recording media applications.","1941-0069","","10.1109/20.950807","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=950807","","Nanostructured materials;Composite materials;Iron;Nanoparticles;Annealing;Assembly;Temperature;Magnetic materials;Solvents;Magnetic superlattices","iron alloys;platinum alloys;magnetic particles;superparamagnetism;nanostructured materials;self-assembly;magnetic recording;coercive force;annealing;ferromagnetic materials;magnetic hysteresis","compositionally controlled FePt nanoparticle materials;high temperature solution phase decomposition;reduction;oleic acid;oleyl amine;molar ratio;alkane solvent;self-organization;nanoparticle superlattices;disordered fcc structure;superparamagnetic behavior;thermal annealing;internal particle structure;magnetic properties;highly ordered fct phase;coercivity;ultra-high density magnetic recording media;4 nm;FePt;Fe/sub 30/Pt/sub 70/;Fe/sub 80/Pt/sub 20/;Fe/sub 55/Pt/sub 45/","","185","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Algorithms that both reduce the dimensionality of the data sets and handle highly correlated bands are required to exploit the information in these data sets effectively. the authors propose a set of best-bases feature extraction algorithms that are simple, fast, and highly effective for classification of hyperspectral data. These techniques intelligently combine subsets of adjacent bands into a smaller number of features. Both top-down and bottom-up algorithms are proposed. The top-down algorithm recursively partitions the bands into two (not necessarily equal) sets of bands and then replaces each final set of bands by its mean value. The bottom-up algorithm builds an agglomerative tree by merging highly correlated adjacent bands and projecting them onto their Fisher direction, yielding high discrimination among classes. Both these algorithms are used in a pairwise classifier framework where the original C-class problem is divided into a set of (/sub 2//sup C/) two-class problems. The new algorithms (1) find variable length bases localized in wavelength, (2) favor grouping highly correlated adjacent bands that, when merged either by taking their mean or Fisher linear projection, yield maximum discrimination, and (3) seek orthogonal bases for each of the (/sub 2//sup C/) two-class problems into which a C-class problem can be decomposed.

The empirical validations performed thus far would suggest that a core set of validated metrics is close to being identified. However, none of these studies allow for the potentially confounding effect of class size. We demonstrate a strong size confounding effect and question the results of previous object-oriented metrics validation studies. We first investigated whether there is a confounding effect of class size in validation studies of object-oriented metrics and show that, based on previous work, there is reason to believe that such an effect exists. We then describe a detailed empirical methodology for identifying those effects. Finally, we perform a study on a large C++ telecommunications framework to examine if size is really a confounder. This study considered the Chidamber and Kemerer metrics and a subset of the Lorenz and Kidd metrics. The dependent variable was the incidence of a fault attributable to a field failure (fault-proneness of a class). Our findings indicate that, before controlling for size, the results are very similar to previous studies. The metrics that are expected to be validated are indeed associated with fault-proneness.","1939-3520","","10.1109/32.935855","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=935855","","Size control;Software quality;Testing;Telecommunication control;Helium;Software engineering;Maintenance;Guidelines;Object oriented modeling;Predictive models","software metrics;object-oriented programming;C++ language;software fault tolerance;software quality","class size;object-oriented metrics;software metrics validation;C++;telecommunications framework;fault-proneness;software quality","","218","","110","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, these two considerations are only applicable to their respective regions of validity. A common question to ask is what are the conditions under which we would choose one or the other of these two approximations? Since these approximations are basically roughness-dependent, how can we handle the in-between cases where neither is appropriate? In this paper, a physical-based transition function that naturally connects these two approximations is proposed. The like-polarized backscattering coefficients are evaluated with the model and are compared with those calculated with a moment method simulation for both Gaussian and non-Gaussian correlated surfaces. It is found that the proposed transition function provides an excellent prediction for the backscattering coefficient in the frequency and angle trends.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.951094","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=951094","","Scattering;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Fresnel reflection;Surface waves;Dielectrics;Backscatter;Frequency;Councils;Remote sensing","geophysical techniques;terrain mapping;remote sensing by radar;radar theory;backscatter;radar cross-sections;rough surfaces","geophysical measurement technique;transition model;land surface;terrain mapping;radar remote sensing;reflection coefficient;surface scattering;radar scattering;backscatter;wave scattering model;randomly dielectric rough surface;random media;Fresnel reflection coefficients;incident angle;specular angle;approximation;roughness;like-polarized backscattering coefficient;moment method;transition function","","99","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Given a circuit and its performance specifications, the goal is to automatically determine the device sizes in order to meet the given performance specifications while minimizing a cost function, such as a weighted sum of the active area and power dissipation. The approach is based on the observation that the first order behavior of a MOS transistor in the saturation region is such that the cost and the constraint functions for this optimization problem can be modeled as posynomial in the design variables. The problem is then solved efficiently as a convex optimization problem. Second order effects are then handled by formulating the problem as one of solving a sequence of convex programs. Numerical experiments show that the solutions to the sequence of convex programs converge to the same design point for widely varying initial guesses. This strongly suggests that the approach is capable of determining the globally optimal solution to the problem. Accuracy of performance prediction in the sizing program (implemented in MATLAB) is maintained by using a newly proposed MOS transistor model and verified against detailed SPICE simulation.","1937-4151","","10.1109/43.905672","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=905672","","Operational amplifiers;Circuits;Cost function;MOSFETs;Mathematical model;Predictive models;Power dissipation;Constraint optimization;Design optimization;Accuracy","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;operational amplifiers;geometric programming;circuit optimisation;circuit simulation;SPICE;integrated circuit design;circuit CAD;integrated circuit modelling;VLSI","CMOS;op-amp sizing;geometric programming formulation;performance specifications;device sizes;cost function;weighted sum;active area;power dissipation;MOS transistor;saturation region;design variables;convex optimization;MATLAB;SPICE simulation","","125","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When UV/ozone was employed to treat the surfaces, the surface tension increased, and the base component increased the most. The change in surface tension due to UV/O/sub 3/ treatment decayed with time after the treatment. The difference in surface tension between untreated and treated surface became smaller with the increase of time after UV/O/sub 3/ treatment. Different substrates showed different rate of decay in surface tension change. Among the surfaces studied, BCB passivation showed the fastest decay after treatment, while alumina showed the slowest decay. The contact angles of several liquid underfill materials on BCB passivation and their surface tension before and after curing were also measured.

This paper presents an approach to directly utilize VSI current regulation strategies to control the voltage for a CSI, without requiring significant modification or development. The approach uses a space-vector mapping technique to convert VSI modulation signals to CSI gate drive signals, which allows VSI closed-loop current control strategies to be directly applied to CSI voltage regulation.

"Fast impulsive noise removal","P. S.

This recursive nonlinear filter is composed of two conditional rules, which are applied independently, in any order, one after the other. It identifies noisy items by inspection of their surrounding neighborhood, and afterwards it replaces their values with the most ""conservative"" ones out of their neighbors' values. In this way, no new values are introduced and the histogram distribution range is conserved. This n-dimensional filter can be decomposed recursively to a lower dimensional space, each time generating two sets of n(n-1)-dimensional filters. This study, which focuses on the case of two-dimensional signals (gray scale images), explores one possible implementation of this new filter and orients the evaluation of its performance toward the median filter, as this filter is the basis of many more sophisticated filters for impulsive noise reduction. Tests were carried out using both real and artificial images. We found this new filter to be much faster than the median filter while performing comparably in terms of both image information conservation and noise reduction, which suggests that it could replace the median filter for the preliminary processing included in state-of-the-art noise removal filters. This new filter should either eliminate or attenuate most noisy pixels in synthetic and natural images not excessively contaminated. It has a slight smoothing effect on nonnoisy image regions. In addition, it is scalable, easily implemented, and adaptable to specific applications.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.892455","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=892455","","Noise shaping;Nonlinear filters;Information filtering;Information filters;Noise reduction;Layout;Working environment noise;Noise level;Smoothing methods;Application software","image restoration;impulse noise;interference suppression;median filters;nonlinear filters;recursive filters;filtering theory;multidimensional digital filters","impulsive noise removal;generic n-dimensional filter;recursive nonlinear filter;conditional rules;histogram distribution range;two-dimensional signals;gray scale images;median filter;noise reduction;artificial images;real images;noisy pixels;natural images;smoothing effect;nonnoisy image regions","","128","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This method is proven to be polynomial and it is also efficient in practice. The benefit of this method is that it also gives a lower bound on the theoretical optimal solution along with the result. The difference between the lower bound and the cost of the found path is very small proving the good quality of the result. Moreover, by further relaxing the optimality of paths, an easy way is provided to control the trade-off between the running time of the algorithm and the quality of the found paths.

"Markov modeling of minimally invasive surgery based on tool/tissue interaction and force/torque signatures for evaluating surgical skills","J. Rosen; B. Hannaford; C. G. Richards; M. N. Sinanan","Dept. of Electr. Eng., Washington Univ., Seattle, WA, USA; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","","2001","48","5","579","591","The best method of training for laparoscopic surgical skills is controversial. Some advocate observation in the operating room, while others promote animal and simulated models or a combination of surgery-related tasks. A crucial process in surgical education is to evaluate the level of surgical skills. For laparoscopic surgery, skill evaluation is traditionally performed subjectively by experts grading a video of a procedure performed by a student. By its nature, this process uses fuzzy criteria. The objective of the current study was to develop and assess a skill scale using Markov models (MMs). Ten surgeons [five novice surgeons (NS); five expert surgeons (ES)] performed a cholecystectomy and Nissen fundoplication in a porcine model. An instrumented laparoscopic grasper equipped with a three-axis force/torque (F/T) sensor was used to measure the forces/torques at the hand/tool interface synchronized with a video of the tool operative maneuvers. A synthesis of frame-by-frame video analysis and a vector quantization algorithm, allowed to define F/T signatures associated with 14 different types of tool/tissue interactions. The magnitude of F/T applied by NS and ES were significantly different (p<0.05) and varied based on the task being performed. High F/T magnitudes were applied by NS compared with ES while performing tissue manipulation and vice versa in tasks involved tissue dissection. From each step of the surgical procedures, two MMs were developed representing the performance of three surgeons out of the five in the ES and NS groups. The data obtained by the remaining two surgeons in each group were used for evaluating the performance scale. The final result was a surgical performance index which represented a ratio of statistical similarity between the examined surgeon's MM and the MM of NS and ES. The difference between the performance index value, for a surgeon under study, and the NS/ES boundary, indicated the level of expertise in the surgeon's own group. Preliminary data suggest that a performance index based on MM and F/T signatures provides an objective means of distinguishing NS from ES. In addition, this methodology can be further applied to evaluate haptic virtual reality surgical simulators for improving realism in surgical education.","1558-2531","","10.1109/10.918597","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=918597","","Minimally invasive surgery;Torque;Surges;Performance analysis;Performance evaluation;Force measurement;Animals;Instruments;Laparoscopes;Force sensors","surgery;biomedical education;computer based training;virtual reality;haptic interfaces;hidden Markov models;medical computing;performance index;vector quantisation","minimally invasive surgery;Markov modeling;tool-tissue interaction;force-torque signatures;surgical skills evaluation;laparoscopy training;surgical education;fuzzy criteria;skill scale;cholecystectomy;Nissen fundoplication;porcine model;instrumented laparoscopic grasper;three-axis force/torque sensor;hand/tool interface;frame-by-frame video analysis;vector quantization algorithm;tissue manipulation;tissue dissection;surgical performance index;statistical similarity ratio;haptic virtual reality surgical simulators;endoscopy","Algorithms;Animals;Cholecystectomy, Laparoscopic;Cholecystectomy, Laparoscopic;Computer Simulation;Computer-Assisted Instruction;Internship and Residency;Laparoscopy;Markov Chains;Surgery;Swine;User-Computer Interface;Video Recording","168","","48","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Vulnerabilities associated with the power system, the information network, and the communication network are also evaluated. The approach is characterized by the extensive use of real-time information from diverse sources, coupled with the development of an evolving dynamic decision event tree. A novel multiagent based platform is used to evaluate system vulnerability to catastrophic events taking in account the market environment and competing entities. Several new concepts associated with wide-area measurements and controls, networked sensors, and adaptive self healing are used to reconfigure the network to minimize the system vulnerability.

Among these configurations, only a few have been known previously and used in practice. It is found that the efficiency of PFC voltage regulators can be improved by reducing the amount of redundant power to be processed by the constituent converters.

A 3-DOF leg simulator has been developed to generate various hip motions and analyze the results of walking motions. The tracking control of knee joint angle was performed with this leg simulator.

Among the various current control schemes for a voltage source inverter-fed PM synchronous motor drive, the predictive control is known to give a superior performance. This control technique, however, requires the full knowledge of machine parameters and operating conditions, and gives an unsatisfactory response under the parameter mismatch between the motor and controller. To overcome such a limitation, the disturbances caused by the parameter variations are estimated by using a time delay control approach and used for the computation of the reference voltages by a simple feedforward control. Thus, the steady-state control performance can be significantly improved in an extremely simple manner, while retaining the good characteristics of the predictive control such as the good transient response and stable inverter operation.

For the ML receiver we propose to pick the subset whose output constellation has the largest minimum Euclidean distance. For the linear receiver we propose use of the post-processing SNRs (signal to noise ratios) of the multiplexed streams whereby the antenna subset that induces the largest minimum SNR is chosen.

Analytical expressions for the third and fourth-order cumulants of the LPC residual of short-term speech are derived assuming a sinusoidal model. The flat spectral feature of this residual results in distinct characteristics for these cumulants in terms of phase, periodicity and harmonic content and yields closed-form expressions for the skewness and kurtosis. Important properties about these cumulants and their similarity with the autocorrelation function are revealed from this exploratory part. They show that the HOS of speech are sufficiently distinct from those of Gaussian noise and can be used as a basis for speech detection. Their immunity to Gaussian noise makes them particularly useful in algorithms designed for low SNR environments. The proposed VAD algorithm combines HOS metrics with second-order measures, such as SNR and LPC prediction error, to classify speech and noise frames. The variance of the HOS estimators is quantified and used to yield a likelihood measure for noise frames. Moreover, a voicing condition for speech frames is derived based on the relation between the skewness and kurtosis of voiced speech. The performance of the algorithm is compared to the ITU-T G.729B VAD in various noise conditions, and quantified using the probability of correct and false classifications. The results show that the proposed algorithm has an overall better performance than G.729B, with noticeable improvement in Gaussian-like noises, such as street and parking garage, and moderate to low SNR.","1558-2353","","10.1109/89.905996","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=905996","","Robustness;Higher order statistics;Speech enhancement;Signal to noise ratio;Speech analysis;Linear predictive coding;Gaussian noise;Noise measurement;Working environment noise;Closed-form solution","speech coding;signal detection;linear predictive coding;higher order statistics;Gaussian noise;probability","voice activity detection;higher-order statistics;LPC residual domain;fourth-order cumulants;third-order cumulants;short-term speech;sinusoidal model;flat spectral feature;phase;periodicity;harmonic content;closed-form expressions;autocorrelation function;skewness;kurtosis;Gaussian noise;speech detection;low SNR;VAD algorithm;LPC prediction error;noise frames;likelihood measure;voiced speech;ITU-T G.729B VAD;false classification probability;correct classification probability","","133","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the second step, linear interpolation is performed in the time direction. This scheme has been proven to be very successful in multicarrier HF communications systems.","1090-3038","0-7803-6728-6","10.1109/VETECS.2001.944491","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=944491","","Channel estimation;Frequency estimation;Finite impulse response filter;Time frequency analysis;Wiener filter;OFDM modulation;Frequency response;Interpolation;Digital video broadcasting;Europe","OFDM modulation;discrete Fourier transforms;frequency estimation;interpolation;radio links","DFT-based channel estimation;2D-pilot-symbol-aided OFDM;wireless systems;channel estimation algorithm;2D pilot-symbol assisted modulation;2D-PSAM;coherent OFDM;2D time-frequency grid;scattered symbols;frequency response estimation;efficient DFT-based algorithm;pilot symbols;linear interpolation;multicarrier HF communications systems;HF links","","28","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

America, Waukegan, IL, USA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","","2001","16","2","248","255","The most common modulation strategy adopted for motor control in adjustable speed drives (ASDs) is pulse width modulation (PWM). In general, the output is modulated at a carrier frequency ranging from 1.0 kHz to 20.0 kHz. Experiences with PWM drives have shown that there exist two important concerns: (1) common mode current; and (2) over-voltage at the motor when the distance between motor and the inverter is larger than the critical distance. The high carrier frequency along with fast rise and fall time of the insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) employed results in nontrivial common-mode or ground currents. The high dv/dt causes shaft voltage, which leads to bearing currents. This phenomenon has been identified as one of the reasons for premature bearing failure in PWM driven motors. A new scheme to attenuate the common mode noise and hence reduce shaft voltage is proposed. Experimental results showing the effectiveness of the proposed solution is also presented.","1941-0107","","10.1109/63.911149","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=911149","","Pulse width modulation;Attenuation;Variable speed drives;Frequency;Pulse width modulation inverters;Insulated gate bipolar transistors;Shafts;Voltage;Motor drives;Space vector pulse width modulation","variable speed drives;insulated gate bipolar transistors;PWM invertors;AC motor drives;machine bearings;machine control","common mode current attenuation;PWM drives;modulation strategy;motor control;adjustable speed drives;pulse width modulation;carrier frequency;common mode current;over-voltage;inverter;insulated gate bipolar transistors;IGBT rise time;IGBT fall time;nontrivial common-mode currents;nontrivial ground currents;shaft voltage;bearing currents;premature bearing failure;PWM driven motors;common mode noise;1 to 20 kHz","","100","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"A three-phase soft-transition inverter with a novel control strategy for zero-current and near zero-voltage switching","Yong Li; F. C. Lee; D. Boroyevich","Bradley Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

Inst. & State Univ., Blacksburg, VA, USA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","","2001","16","5","710","723","This paper proposes a new soft-transition control strategy for a three-phase zero-current-transition (ZCT) inverter circuit. Each phase leg of the inverter circuit consists of an LC resonant tank, two main switches, and two auxiliary switches. The proposed strategy is realized by planning the switching patterns and timings of these four switches based on the load current information. It enables all the main switches and auxiliary switches to be turned on and turned off under zero-current conditions, and achieves a near zero-voltage turn-on for the main switches. Compared with existing ZCT strategies, the diode reverse recovery current and switching turn-on loss are substantially reduced, the current and thermal stresses in the auxiliary devices are evenly distributed over every switching cycle, and the resonant capacitor voltage stress is reduced from twice the DC bus voltage to 1.3-1.4 times the DC bus voltage. The proposed strategy is also suitable for three-phase power-factor-correction (PFC) rectifier applications. The operation principles, including a detailed analyst based on the state-plane technique, and a design rule are described in this paper. The circuit operation is first verified by a computer simulation, and is then tested with a 50-kW three-phase inverter to the full power level together with a three-phase induction motor in a closed-loop speed/torque control. Significant reductions in switching losses and voltage/current stresses over existing techniques have been experimentally demonstrated.","1941-0107","","10.1109/63.949504","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=949504","","Inverters;Switches;Voltage;Thermal stresses;Resonance;Switching circuits;Circuit testing;Leg;RLC circuits;Strategic planning","switching circuits;invertors;induction motor drives;power factor correction;rectifying circuits;torque control;angular velocity control;machine control;closed loop systems;losses","three-phase soft-transition inverter;control strategy;near zero-voltage switching;zero-current switching;inverter circuit;phase leg;LC resonant tank;auxiliary switches;main switches;switching patterns planning;diode reverse recovery current;switching turn-on loss;thermal stress reduction;current stress reduction;three-phase power-factor-correction;rectifier;operation principles;state-plane technique;design rule;computer simulation;three-phase inverter;full power level;three-phase induction motor;closed-loop torque control;closed-loop speed control;switching losses reduction;soft switching control strategy;50 kW","","42","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Aspect-oriented programming takes aim at software complexity","S. K. Miller","NA","Computer","","2001","34","4","18","21","As global digitalization and the size of applications expand at an exponential rate, software engineering's complexities are also growing. One feature of this complexity is the repetition of functionality throughout an application. An example of the problems this complexity causes occurs when programmers must change an oft-repeated feature for an updated or new version of an application. It is often difficult for programmers to find every instance of such a feature in millions of lines of code. Failing to do so, however, can introduce bugs. To address this issue, software researchers are developing methodologies based on a new programming element: the aspect. An aspect is a piece of code that describes a recurring property of a program. Applications can, of course, have multiple aspects. Aspects provide cross-cutting modularity. In other words, programmers can use aspects to create software modules for issues that cut across various parts of an application. Aspects have the potential to make programmers' work easier, less time-consuming and less error-prone. Proponents say aspects could also lead to less expensive applications, shorter upgrade cycles and software that is flexible and more customizable. A number of companies and universities are working on aspects or aspect-like concepts.","1558-0814","","10.1109/2.917532","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=917532","","Programming profession;Java;Encapsulation;Scattering;Writing;Application software;Helium;Production;Power generation;Prefetching","programming;software metrics;software maintenance","aspect-oriented programming;software complexity;global digitalization;application size;software engineering;repeated functionality;program modification;software bugs;recurring program properties;cross-cutting modularity;software modules;upgrade cycles;flexible customizable software","","9","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This normally requires a switching frequency above the resonant frequency, so higher conduction and turn-off losses may be expected. In this paper, three different fixed-frequency control strategies for the ZVS full-bridge series resonant converter are analyzed and compared, in order to determine which one achieves the least conduction and turn-off losses, without losing ZVS and considering input-voltage and load variations.","0275-9306","0-7803-7067-8","10.1109/PESC.2001.954057","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=954057","","Zero voltage switching;Resonance;Switching frequency;Resonant frequency;Power supplies;Switching converters;Frequency conversion;Stress;MOSFETs;Load management","switching circuits;DC-DC power convertors;resonant power convertors;frequency control;control system analysis;power MOSFET;field effect transistor switches;power semiconductor switches;bridge circuits;losses","fixed-frequency control strategies comparison;ZVS full-bridge DC/DC series resonant converters;switching frequency;resonant frequency;turn-off losses;input-voltage;load variations;conduction losses;component stresses;MOSFETs;ZVS operation","","32","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The threshold voltages of thin (3.5 nm) and thick (6.8 nm) field-effect transistors (FETs) were measured, and an increase in interface trap density with increasing fluorine content was identified. An increase in oxide thickness and improvement in hot-carrier immunity were observed. Little change to oxide dielectric integrity was noted, but the negative bias threshold instability (NBTI) shift was improved with the introduction of fluorine. These data indicate that benefits may be obtained by introducing fluorine into the p-type FET (PFET), but that the increase in interface traps makes fluorine in the n-type FET (NFET) less attractive from a technological perspective.

This not only increases the system's capacity cost effectively, but also reduces the transmission power for mobile hosts and extends system coverage. We compare the performance of the iCAR system with conventional cellular systems in terms of the call blocking/dropping probability, throughput, and signaling overhead via analysis and simulation.

The reference-model-based auxiliary controller improves the robustness of the ACC dynamics in buck-derived distributed power systems, preserving loop gain crossover frequency and stability margins over significant changes of the number of connected modules, the load and the line voltage. Moreover, this control scheme shows much better disturbance rejection properties, i.e., closed-loop output impedance and audiosusceptibility, than conventional ACC. From a control theory point of view robust performance is achieved, preserving stability. A multimodule buck prototype has been experimentally tested with different numbers of modules on stream, line, and load conditions, including discontinuous conduction mode.

These principles are exploited by efficient algorithms in both the off-line case (via a new joint diagonalization procedure) and in the on-line case (via a Newton-like procedure). Some experiments showing the good performance of our algorithms and evidencing an interesting feature of our methods are presented: their ability to achieve a kind of super-efficiency. The paper concludes with a discussion contrasting separating methods for non-Gaussian and nonstationary models and emphasizing that, as a matter of fact, ""what makes the algorithms work"" is-strictly speaking-not the nonstationarity itself but rather the property that each realization of the source signals has a time-varying envelope.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.942614","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=942614","","Source separation;Mutual information;Vectors;Covariance matrix;Independent component analysis;Image reconstruction;Laboratories;Computational modeling;Particle measurements;Blind source separation","time-varying systems;maximum likelihood estimation;signal processing","blind separation;instantaneous mixtures;nonstationary sources;source separation algorithms;maximum likelihood;minimum mutual information;off-line case;joint diagonalization procedure;on-line case;Newton-like procedure;performance;super-efficiency;nonGaussian models;nonstationary models;time-varying envelope","","280","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Bilateral upper extremity kinematic data were acquired with a six camera Vicon motion analysis system using a Micro-VAX workstation. Internal joint moments at the wrist, elbow, and shoulder were determined in the three clinical planes using the inverse dynamics method. The walker dynamometer system allowed characterization of upper extremity loading demands. Significantly differing upper extremity loading patterns were Identified for three walker usage methods.

With switching speeds well below 1 ns in today's gigahertz processors, and VLSI circuit complexity exceeding the 100 million transistors per chip mark, power and signal distribution is characterized by multigigahertz bandwidth pulses propagating through a tightly coupled three-dimensional wiring structure that exhibits resonant behavior at the upper part of the spectrum. Consequently, in addition to the inductive and capacitive coupling, present between adjacent wires across the entire frequency bandwidth, distributed electromagnetic effects, manifested as interconnect-induced delay, reflection, radiation, and long-range nonlocal coupling, become prominent at high frequencies, with a decisive impact of overall system performance. The electromagnetic nature of such high-frequency effects, combined with the geometric complexity of the interconnect structure, make the electrical design of today's performance-driven systems extremely challenging. Its success is heavily dependent on the availability of sophisticated electromagnetic modeling methodologies and computer-aided design tools. This paper presents an overview of the different approaches employed today for the development of an electromagnetic modeling and simulation framework that can effectively tackle the complexity of the interconnect circuit and facilitate its design. In addition to identifying the current state of the art, an assessment is given of the challenges that lie ahead in the signal integrity-driven electrical design of tomorrow's performance- and/or portability-driven, multifunctional ULSI systems.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.929652","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=929652","","Integrated circuit interconnections;Electromagnetic modeling;Very large scale integration;Electromagnetic coupling;Electromagnetic radiation;Signal processing;Bandwidth;Coupling circuits;Frequency;Electromagnetic analysis","integrated circuit modelling;integrated circuit packaging;integrated circuit interconnections;VLSI;wiring;delays;circuit layout CAD;circuit simulation","electrical modeling;electronic packages;interconnects;electromagnetic properties;very large scale integration;switching speeds;signal distribution;multigigahertz bandwidth pulses;tightly coupled three-dimensional wiring structure;resonant behavior;capacitive coupling;inductive coupling;adjacent wires;frequency bandwidth;interconnect-induced delay;long-range nonlocal coupling;high-frequency effects;geometric complexity;computer-aided design tools;multifunctional ULSI systems","","127","","157","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The loss variations are estimated by considering the SRM operation principles and assuming (if not known) loss values at only one operating point. Using the obtained expressions, the SRM efficiency contours can be then estimated before designing and building the SRM.

The model can be used to simulate the transient behavior of the grounding system under lightning strike. The simulation results are in good agreement with that of the model based on the solution of full Maxwell's equations. The influence of different parameters, such as the soil relative permittivity /spl epsi//sub /spl tau//, the soil resistivity /spl rho/, and the conductivity and diameter of the conductor, on the transient voltage distribution of the grounding system is investigated. It shows that, among the parameters investigated here, the soil resistivity is the most important parameter that affects the transient response of bare buried conductors. The soil permittivity has very little influence on the transient response of the grounding system when the grounding system is buried in the soil with low resistivity, but have moderate influence in the soil with extremely high resistivity. The conductivity of the conductor and skin effect have practically no influence on the peak transient voltage of the grounding system. Increase in conductor diameter tends to decrease the peak transient voltage. The model presented in this paper is simple, but sufficiently accurate and can be used easily in engineering practice. Since the model is in the time domain, it could be easily coupled to the other time-domain models of nonlinear surge-protection components.","1558-187X","","10.1109/15.942606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=942606","","Power system protection","power system protection;earthing;time-domain analysis;transmission line theory;lightning protection;soil;transient response","grounding system;time-domain transmission line model improvement;mutual electromagnetic coupling;grounding structure;air-earth interface;transient behavior;lightning strike;soil relative permittivity;soil resistivity;conductor conductivity;conductor diameter;transient voltage distribution;transient response;soil permittivity;skin effect;peak transient voltage;nonlinear surge-protection components","","68","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The approach is based on joint interpolation of the image gray levels and gradient/isophotes directions, smoothly extending in an automatic fashion the isophote lines into the holes of missing data. This interpolation is computed by solving the variational problem via its gradient descent flow, which leads to a set of coupled second order partial differential equations, one for the gray-levels and one for the gradient orientations. The process underlying this approach can be considered as an interpretation of the Gestaltist's principle of good continuation. No limitations are imposed on the topology of the holes, and all regions of missing data can be simultaneously processed, even if they are surrounded by completely different structures. Applications of this technique include the restoration of old photographs and removal of superimposed text like dates, subtitles, or publicity. Examples of these applications are given.

By introducing an extra input to the observer, a direct estimation of the time-varying fault is obtained when the residual is controlled, by this extra input, to zero. The stability analysis of this observer is proved and some relevant sufficient conditions are obtained.

The answer to this question is valuable for two main reasons. First, it allows calibration of real world data-gathering protocols and an understanding of factors that prevent these protocols from approaching fundamental limits. Secondly, the dependence of lifetime on factors like the region of observation, the source behavior within that region, basestation location, number of nodes, radio path loss characteristics, efficiency of node electronics and the energy available on a node, is exposed. This allows architects of sensor networks to focus on factors that have the greatest potential impact on network lifetime. By employing a combination of theory and extensive simulations of constructed networks, we show that in all data gathering scenarios presented, there exist networks which achieve lifetimes equal to or >95% of the derived bounds. Hence, depending on the scenario, our bounds are either tight or near-tight.","","0-7803-7097-1","10.1109/ICC.2001.937346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=937346","","Sensor phenomena and characterization;Intelligent sensors;Energy efficiency;Wireless sensor networks;Acoustic sensors;Protocols;Force sensors;Upper bound;Calibration;Micromechanical devices","electric sensing devices;radio networks;microsensors;calibration;protocols","upper bounds;sensor networks lifetime;energy efficiency;data collection;energy-constrained nodes;data-gathering protocols calibration;observation region;source behavior;basestation location;radio path loss;network nodes;node electronics efficiency;microsensors integration;wireless integrated sensor nodes;network simulations","","337","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The method drastically improves upon the conventional beamformer and has a performance comparable with the best high-resolution (HR) techniques. It further applies when the number of sources exceeds the number of sensors: a situation that cannot be handled by standard HR techniques.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.912914","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=912914","","Matched filters;Direction of arrival estimation;Sensor arrays;Transmission line matrix methods;Narrowband;Multiple signal classification;Discrete Fourier transforms;Signal representations;Helium;Planar arrays","direction-of-arrival estimation;array signal processing;matched filters;filtering theory","global matched filter;DOA estimation;uniform circular arrays;direction of arrivals;narrowband sources;uniformly spaced beams;model-fitting approach;statistical properties;sensors","","116","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This deliberate introduction of input-dependent errors leads to degradation in the algorithmic performance, which is compensated for via algorithmic noise-tolerance (ANT) schemes. The resulting setup that comprises of the DSP architecture operating at subcritical voltage and the error control scheme is referred to as soft DSP. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is enhanced when arithmetic units with a higher ""delay imbalance"" are employed. A prediction-based error-control scheme is proposed to enhance the performance of the filtering algorithm in the presence of errors due to soft computations. For a frequency selective filter, it is shown that the proposed scheme provides 60-81% reduction in energy dissipation for filter bandwidths up to 0.5 /spl pi/ (where 2 /spl pi/ corresponds to the sampling frequency f/sub s/) over that achieved via conventional architecture and voltage scaling, with a maximum of 0.5-dB degradation in the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR/sub o/). It is also shown that the proposed algorithmic noise-tolerance schemes can also be used to improve the performance of DSP algorithms in presence of bit-error rates of up to 10/sup -3/ due to deep submicron (DSM) noise.","1557-9999","","10.1109/92.974895","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=974895","","Digital signal processing;Signal processing algorithms;Voltage;Degradation;Frequency;Filters;Signal to noise ratio;Delay;Throughput;Error correction","VLSI;chip scale packaging;digital signal processing chips;power consumption;error compensation;interference suppression;delays;computer architecture;prediction theory;computer power supplies;filtering theory;integrated circuit noise","low-energy digital signal processing;supply voltage;critical path delay;input-dependent errors;degradation;algorithmic noise-tolerance;DSP architecture;subcritical voltage;error control;soft DSP;filtering algorithm;frequency selective filter;energy dissipation;filter bandwidths;voltage scaling;0.5 dB degradation;bit-error rates;deep submicron noise;0.5 dB","","168","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Fuzzy entropy is employed to evaluate the information of pattern distribution in the pattern space. With this information, we can partition the pattern space into nonoverlapping decision regions for pattern classification. Since the decision regions do not overlap, both the complexity and computational load of the classifier are reduced and thus the training time and classification time are extremely short. Although the decision regions are partitioned into nonoverlapping subspaces, we can achieve good classification performance since the decision regions can be correctly determined via our proposed fuzzy entropy measure. In addition, we also investigate the use of fuzzy entropy to select relevant features. The feature selection procedure not only reduces the dimensionality of a problem but also discards noise-corrupted, redundant and unimportant features. Finally, we apply the proposed classifier to the Iris database and Wisconsin breast cancer database to evaluate the classification performance. Both of the results show that the proposed classifier can work well for the pattern classification application.","1941-0492","","10.1109/3477.931536","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=931536","","Entropy;Pattern classification;Spatial databases;Neural networks;Region 1;Noise reduction;Iris;Breast cancer;Performance analysis;Region 2","pattern classification;computational complexity;fuzzy logic","fuzzy classifier;feature selection;fuzzy entropy;pattern distribution;pattern space;pattern classification;complexity;computational load;Iris database;Wisconsin breast cancer database","","157","","46","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The mass portions are segmented by establishing intensity links from the central portions of masses into the surrounding areas. We introduce methods for analyzing oriented flow-like textural information in mammograms. Features based on flow orientation in adaptive ribbons of pixels across the margins of masses are proposed to classify the regions detected as true mass regions or false-positives (FPs). The methods yielded a mass versus normal tissue classification accuracy represented as an area (A/sub z/) of 0.87 under the receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) curve with a dataset of 56 images including 30 benign disease, 13 malignant disease, and 13 normal cases selected from the mini Mammographic Image Analysis Society database. A sensitivity of 81% was achieved at 2.2 FPs/image. Malignant tumor versus normal tissue classification resulted in a higher A/sub z/ value of 0.9 under the ROC curve using only the 13 malignant and 13 normal cases with a sensitivity of 85% at 2.45 FPs/image. The mass detection algorithm could detect all the 13 malignant tumors successfully, but achieved a success rate of only 63% (19/30) in detecting the benign masses. The mass regions that were successfully segmented were further classified as benign or malignant disease by computing five texture features based on gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GCMs) and using the features in a logistic regression method. The features were computed using adaptive ribbons of pixels across the boundaries of the masses. Benign versus malignant classification using the GCM-based texture features resulted in A/sub z/=0.79 with 19 benign and 13 malignant cases.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.974917","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=974917","","Breast;Cancer;Image texture analysis;Diseases;Image segmentation;Sensitivity;Malignant tumors;Smoothing methods;Information analysis;Image databases","mammography;tumours;image segmentation;image classification;image texture;feature extraction;medical image processing;image sampling;smoothing methods;covariance matrices;iterative methods","mammography;breast masses detection;false-positive analysis;tumor detection;texture flow-field;tumor classification;density slicing;Gaussian smoothing;subsampling preprocessing;flow orientation;adaptive ribbons of pixels;receiver operating characteristics curve;gray-level cooccurrence matrices;logistic regression method;image segmentation;breast parenchyma;computed radiography images;automated scheme;iterative decimation;intrinsic images;impulse response;Gaussian smoothing filter;coherence image;feature extraction","Algorithms;Breast Neoplasms;Breast Neoplasms;Cluster Analysis;Databases, Factual;False Positive Reactions;Female;Humans;Mammography;Mammography;Mammography;Pattern Recognition, Automated;ROC Curve;Radiographic Image Enhancement;Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Reproducibility of Results","143","","50","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed UPS is comprised of two push-pull converters based on a low-voltage battery for reduced cost: one in series with the input and the other in parallel with the load. In the presence of input power, the UPS acts as an output voltage regulator and at the same time as an active filter while charging the battery. In case of loss of input power, the UPS supplies a regulated sinusoidal voltage to the load, drawing power from the battery. The series converter compensates only a small percentage of the input voltage carrying the input current and, therefore, a reduced rating is made. The parallel converter always supplies a nominal voltage and makes a seamless transition to backup mode. In the voltage determination of the parallel converter, the nominal voltage is derived using the feedback linearization concept and then a perturbed voltage is determined for the reactive power control or output voltage regulation.

"Temporal self-imaging effects: theory and application for multiplying pulse repetition rates","J. Azana; M. A. Muriel","ETSI Telecomunicacion, Univ. Politecnica de Madrid, Spain; NA","IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","","2001","7","4","728","744","A time-domain equivalent of the spatial Talbot or self-imaging phenomenon appears when a periodic temporal signal propagates through a dispersive medium under first-order dispersion conditions. The effect is of great interest because it can be applied for multiplying the repetition rate of an arbitrary periodic pulse train without distorting the individual pulse features and essentially without loss of energy. In this way, pulse sequences in the terahertz regime can be generated from typical mode-locked pulse streams (with a few gigahertz repetition rates). The Talbot-based repetition-rate-multiplication technique can be implemented by using a linearly chirped fiber grating (LCFG) as the dispersive medium. As compared with other alternatives, an LCFG can be designed to provide the required bandwidth and dispersion characteristics in significantly more compact forms. Here, by using a signal-theory-based approach, we carry out a general theoretical analysis of the temporal self-imaging phenomenon and derive analytical expressions for all cases of interest (integer and fractional self-imaging effects). We also show how to design a LCFG for implementing the repetition-rate-multiplication technique and discuss the impact of nonidealities in the grating's response on the multiplication process. Results of our study are relevant from both a physical and a practical perspective.","1558-4542","","10.1109/2944.974245","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=974245","","Talbot effect;Optical fiber dispersion;Optical propagation;Optical pulses;Time domain analysis;Signal analysis;Gratings;Equations;Diffraction;Telecommunications","chirp modulation;optical modulation;optical fibre communication;optical images;optical fibre dispersion;optical pulse generation;diffraction gratings;optical fibre filters;time-domain analysis","temporal self-imaging effects;multiplying pulse repetition rates;time-domain equivalent;spatial Talbot phenomenon;self-imaging phenomenon;periodic temporal signal;dispersive medium;first-order dispersion conditions;arbitrary periodic pulse train;individual pulse features;terahertz regime;mode-locked pulse streams;gigahertz repetition rates;Talbot-based repetition-rate-multiplication technique;linearly chirped fiber grating;signal-theory-based approach;temporal self-imaging phenomenon;analytical expressions;fractional self-imaging effects;repetition-rate-multiplication technique;grating response;optical fiber communications;OTDM;WDM;wavelength-division multiplexing;optical pulse generation","","173","","48","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the output frequency of the synthesizer increases, the trade-off between the speed and power dissipation of dividers becomes more critical. Narrow-band injection-locked frequency dividers (ILFD) dissipate a fraction of the energy stored in the tank, which is determined by the quality factor, Q, of the resonator, in every cycle. Therefore, they have fundamentally lower power dissipation than wide-band dividers. Due to their narrow-band nature, ILFDs work in a limited frequency range (locking range). In this paper, shunt-peaking is used as an approach to increase the locking range and lower the power dissipation at higher frequencies.","0193-6530","0-7803-6608-5","10.1109/ISSCC.2001.912698","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=912698","","Frequency conversion;Frequency synthesizers;Power dissipation;Tail;Narrowband;Voltage;Power measurement;Inductors;Wideband;Energy loss","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;frequency dividers","shunt peaking;power dissipation;frequency synthesizer;CMOS narrow-band injection-locked frequency divider;quality factor;resonator;locking range;19 GHz;0.5 mW;0.35 micron","","48","","3","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Conventional direct stator-flux-oriented control schemes have the disadvantage of poor performance in the low-speed operating area when the stator flux is calculated using the voltage model, due to the stator resistance uncertainties and variations. In this paper, a new closed-loop stator-flux estimation method for a stator-flux-oriented vector-controlled induction motor drive is presented in which the stator resistance value is updated during operation. This method is based on a simple algorithm capable of running in a low-cost microcontroller, which is derived from the dynamic model of the induction machine. The effects of stator resistance detuning, especially in the low-speed operating region, are investigated and simulation results are shown. The motor drive system as well as the control logic and the resistance estimator are simulated and characteristic simulation results are derived. In addition, the proposed control scheme is experimentally implemented and some characteristic experimental results are shown. The simulation as well as the experimental results reveal that the proposed method is able to obtain precise flux and torque control, even for very low operating frequencies.","1557-9948","","10.1109/41.969393","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=969393","","Stators;Induction motor drives;Voltage control;Uncertainty;Microcontrollers;Induction machines;Motor drives;Logic;Torque control;Frequency","induction motor drives;stators;electric resistance;machine vector control;closed loop systems;parameter estimation;magnetic flux;magnetic variables control;torque control","stator resistance tuning method;stator-flux-oriented vector-control;vector-controlled induction motor drive;direct stator-flux-oriented control schemes;low-speed operating area;stator flux calculation;stator resistance uncertainties;closed-loop stator-flux estimation method;low-cost microcontroller;dynamic model;motor drive system;control logic;resistance estimator;torque control;very low operating frequencies;flux control","","53","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes related information theory-based measures of coupling and cohesion of a module. These measures have the properties of module-level coupling and cohesion defined by Briand, Morasca and Basili (1997, 1999) .

It is easier to hide explosives than to find them. Many approaches have been proposed and executed for the remote detection of explosives, contraband materials, weapons of mass destruction, currency, etc. Most detection technologies suffer from a common problem: the features they look for, such as discontinuities in electrical conductivity, are not unique properties of the target but are contained, to some degree, in the more benign surroundings. Such a degeneracy leads to ""clutter"" in the response. For example, resolving the false alarms generated by this clutter can determine the rate of advance of a conventional electromagnetic metal detector employed as a landmine detector. One approach that provides a ""unique"" signature is nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) (the technique is also called QR, to avoid confusion with strictly nuclear techniques).

Beacon signals also carry several critical, constantly changing parameters, such as power-supply information, relative address, location, timestamp, signal strength, available bandwidth resources, temperature and pressure. Although transparent to the user community, beacon signals have made wireless systems more intelligent and human-like. They are an integral part of numerous scientific and commercial applications, ranging from mobile networks to search-and-rescue operations and location-tracking systems.

The prototype model is based on the minimum number of characteristic filter parameters to represent the filter transfer function correctly. The parameter values are found from a gradient-based parameter-extraction process using measured S-parameters. Automated filter tuning is performed as a two-step procedure. First, the parameter sensitivities with respect to the tuning elements are determined by a series of S-parameter measurements. Second, the parameter values of the filter are compared to the values of the ideal filter prototype found from a filter synthesis, thus yielding the optimal screw positions.

The formulation of the EBVD model is compared with the complete expression of the electrical admittance of the loaded quartz derived from the transmission line model (TLM). Relative deviations between them do not exceed 3% around 1% bandwidth near resonance. An extended Martin and Granstaff's model and an explicit expression for the frequency shift that supposes an extension of Kanazawa's model for viscoelastic media are obtained. An analysis of the errors associated with the extraction of shear parameters of the coating for different materials prove that, to obtain an error less than 5% in the shear parameters determination, the viscoelastic contribution, defined as the relative error in the thickness computed from the frequency shift by Sauerbrey equation, must be greater than a limit that depends on Q, which is defined as the ratio of the shear storage modulus (G') to shear loss modulus (G""). In the materials studied polymers in the transition range or in the rubbery state with Q=1 and 10, the viscoelastic contribution must be higher than 15% and 50%, respectively, for a 5% limit error in the shear parameters extraction.

We are seeking empirical evidence whether using design patterns is beneficial. In particular, one may prefer using a design pattern even if the actual design problem is simpler than that solved by the pattern, i.e., if not all of the functionality offered by the pattern is actually required. Our experiment investigates software maintenance scenarios that employ various design patterns and compares designs with patterns to simpler alternatives. The subjects were professional software engineers. In most of our nine maintenance tasks, we found positive effects from using a design pattern: either its inherent additional flexibility was achieved without requiring more maintenance time or maintenance time was reduced compared to the simpler alternative. In a few cases, we found negative effects: the alternative solution was less error-prone or required less maintenance time. Overall, we conclude that, unless there is a clear reason to prefer the simpler solution, it is probably wise to choose the flexibility provided by the design pattern because unexpected new requirements often appear.

The goal is to find a controller (if one exists) such that the closed loop is mean square stable for a given packet loss rate. A linear matrix inequality (LMI) condition is developed for the existence of a stabilizing dynamic output feedback controller. This LMI condition is used to study the effect of communication losses on a vehicle following problem.

The slip control results in an operating speed range that suits the wind energy generation requirements. The vector-controlled doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) enables the decoupling between active and reactive power as well as between torque and power factor. Therefore, besides the optimal speed tracking for maximal wind energy conversion, an optimal control strategy for the two converters is developed. This strategy aims to minimise the electrical losses, hence optimising the system overall efficiency.

The results of the automated method are compared with lesion delineations by human experts, showing a high total lesion load correlation.

This new sensor allows the fingers to directly contact the environment without obstructing the human's natural haptic senses. The finger touch force is detected by measuring changes in the coloration of the fingernail; hence the sensor is mounted on the fingernail rather than on the fingertip. Specifically, the fingernail is instrumented with miniature light emitting diodes (LEDs) and photodetectors in order to measure changes in the reflection intensity when the fingertip is pressed against a surface. The changes in intensity are then used to determine changes in the blood volume under the fingernail, a technique termed ""reflectance photoplethysmography"". A hemodynamic model is used to investigate the dynamics of the blood volume at two locations under the fingernail. A miniaturized prototype nail sensor is designed, built, and tested.

The first step of the proposed algorithm implements a linear and space-invariant azimuth filtering that is carried out via a deramping-based technique representing a simplified version of the SPECAN approach. This operation allows the authors to perform a bulk azimuth raw data compression and to achieve a pixel spacing smaller than (or equal to) the expected azimuth resolution of the fully focused image. Thus, the azimuth spectral folding phenomenon, typically affecting the spotlight data, is overcome, and the space-variant characteristics of the stripmap system transfer function are preserved. Accordingly, the residual and precise focusing of the SAR data is achieved by applying a conventional stripmap processing procedure requiring a minor modification and implemented in the frequency domain. The extension of the proposed technique to the case of high bandwidth transmitted chirp signals is also discussed. Experiments carried out on real and simulated data confirm the validity of the presented approach, which is mainly focused on spaceborne systems.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.951090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=951090","","Azimuth;Focusing;Filtering algorithms;Nonlinear filters;Data compression;Pixel;Image resolution;Transfer functions;Frequency domain analysis;Bandwidth","geophysical techniques;geophysical signal processing;terrain mapping;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;spaceborne radar;radar imaging","geophysical measurement technique;land surface;radar remote sensing;terrain mapping;spotlight SAR;data focusing;two-step process;synthetic aperture radar;data-focusing algorithm;SPECAN algorithm;stripmap focusing;space-invariant azimuth filtering;deramping;azimuth spectral folding;space-variant characteristics;high bandwidth transmitted chirp signals;spaceborne radar;spectral analysis","","116","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A simple computational procedure is presented which significantly reduces the network training and evaluation time. Storage space is also reduced by allowing for a nonuniform grid of points about which the RBFs are centered. The network output is shown to be continuous and have a continuous first derivative. When the network is used to approximate a nonlinear dynamic system, the resulting system is bounded-input bounded-output stable. For the special case of a linear system, the RBF network representation is exact on the domain over which it is defined, and it is optimal in terms of the number of distinct storage parameters required.

The Department of Defense Combat Hybrid Power Systems (CHPS) program serves as a case study for magnetic bearing applications on combat vehicles. The University of Texas at Austin Center for Electromechanics (UT-CEM) has designed active magnetic bearing actuators for use in a 5 MW flywheel alternator with a 318 kg (700 lb), 20000 rpm rotor. To minimize CHPS flywheel size and mass, a topology was chosen in which the rotating portion of the flywheel is located outside the stationary components. Accordingly, magnetic bearing actuators are required which share this configuration. Because of inherent low loss and nearly linear force characteristics, UT-CEM has designed and analyzed permanent magnet bias bearing actuators for this application. To verify actuator performance, a nonrotating bearing test fixture was designed and built which permits measurement of static and dynamic force. An AMB control system was designed to provide robust, efficient magnetic levitation of the CHPS rotor over a wide range of operating speeds and disturbance inputs, while minimizing the occurrence of backup bearing touchdowns. This paper discusses bearing system requirements, actuator and controller design, and predicted performance; it also compares theoretical vs. measured actuator characteristics.","1941-0069","","10.1109/20.911846","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=911846","","Magnetic levitation;Energy storage;Actuators;Flywheels;Cogeneration;Vehicles;Force measurement;Control systems;Guns;Pulse power systems","military equipment;flywheels;machine bearings;magnetic bearings;weapons;electromagnetic launchers;actuators;rotors;control system synthesis","active magnetic bearings;energy storage systems;combat vehicles;electric guns;pulsed weapons;rotor bearing design;high-speed flywheel systems;Department of Defense Combat Hybrid Power Systems program;University of Texas at Austin;Center for Electromechanics;flywheel alternator;active magnetic bearing actuators;power supply;multiple systems;military vehicle;mobility load leveling;losses minimisation;nonrotating bearing test fixture;dynamic force measurement;static force measurement;robust efficient magnetic levitation;controller design;rotordynamics;5 MW;318 kg;700 lb","","36","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present a framework and details of the key components for real-time, automatic exploitation of aerial video for surveillance applications. The framework involves separating an aerial video into the natural components corresponding to the scene. Three major components of the scene are the static background geometry, moving objects, and appearance of the static and dynamic components of the scene. In order to delineate videos into these scene components, we have developed real time, image-processing techniques for 2-D/3-D frame-to-frame alignment, change detection, camera control, and tracking of independently moving objects in cluttered scenes. The geo-location of video and tracked objects is estimated by registration of the video to controlled reference imagery, elevation maps, and site models.

In the present experiment, a model of postural control was used to examine the impact of an abnormal distribution of body fat in the abdominal area upon postural stability. Obese and lightweight humanoids were destabilized by imposing a small initial angular speed from a neutral standing position. To avoid a loss of stability yielding a stepping reaction or a fall, an ankle torque is necessary to counteract the perturbation. Three torque parameters-ankle torque onset, time to peak torque, and muscular ankle torque-were entered in a program to simulate the intrinsic variability of the human postural control system. A loss of stability was detected when the center of pressure exceeded stability margins. The most striking observation is the nonlinear increase of torque needed to stabilize the humanoid when the motor response was chararterized by delayed temporal parameters. The effect was more pronounced when an anterior position of the center of mass was included in the simulations. This suggests that, when submitted to daily postural stresses and perturbations, obese persons (particularly those with an abnormal distribution of body fat in the abdominal area) may be at higher risk of falling than lightweight individuals.","1558-0210","","10.1109/7333.928572","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=928572","","Mathematical model;Abdomen;Stability;Hip;Biological system modeling;Humans;Torque control;Control system synthesis;Delay;Stress","biocontrol;biomechanics;health hazards;physiological models;mechanical variables control;mechanical stability","increased falling risk;obesity;mathematical modeling;postural control;epidemiological studies;fracture incidence;lightweight humanoids;abnormal body fat distribution;ankle torque onset;time to peak torque;muscular ankle torque;stability margins;delayed temporal parameters;daily postural stresses","Abdomen;Accidental Falls;Adipose Tissue;Models, Theoretical;Obesity;Posture;Risk Assessment;Torque","170","","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is found that the unconditionally stable FDTD scheme has advantages over the conventional FDTD of the Yee's scheme in modeling structures of fine geometry where a graded mesh is required.

The algorithm constructs paths starting at the source and going towards the destination. But, at each iteration, the algorithm gets rid of all paths that are guaranteed to violate the constraints, thereby keeping only those partial paths that have the potential to be turned into feasible paths, from which the optimal paths are drawn. The choice of which path to be extended first and which path can be pruned depend upon a projected path cost function, which is obtained by adding the cost already incurred to get to an intermediate node to an admissible cost to go the remaining distance to the destination. The Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm is a good choice to give a good admissible cost.

The proposed neural network is topologically organized, where the dynamics of each neuron is characterized by a shunting equation or an additive equation. The state space of the neural network can be either the Cartesian workspace or the joint space of multi-joint robot manipulators. There are only local lateral connections among neurons. The real-time optimal trajectory is generated through the dynamic activity landscape of the neural network without explicitly searching over the free space nor the collision paths, without explicitly optimizing any global cost functions, without any prior knowledge of the dynamic environment, and without any learning procedures. Therefore the model algorithm is computationally efficient. The stability of the neural network system is guaranteed by the existence of a Lyapunov function candidate. In addition, this model is not very sensitive to the model parameters. Several model variations are presented and the differences are discussed. As examples, the proposed models are applied to generate collision-free trajectories for a mobile robot to solve a maze-type of problem, to avoid concave U-shaped obstacles, to track a moving target and at the same to avoid varying obstacles, and to generate a trajectory for a two-link planar robot with two targets. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches are demonstrated through simulation and comparison studies.","1941-0492","","10.1109/3477.931512","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=931512","","Neural networks;Neurons;Equations;Trajectory;Mobile robots;State-space methods;Orbital robotics;Manipulator dynamics;Cost function;Computational modeling","collision avoidance;manipulators;mobile robots;neural nets","collision-free trajectory generation;neural network;multi-joint robot manipulators;state space;mobile robot;collision-free trajectories;trajectory generation","","127","","61","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We had only about 20 percent of the required staff available at our division headquarters in Burlington Heights, Ill., US, and needed to find the other 80 percent to successfully complete the project. Early on, we concluded that our only means to staff the project was to rely on software development engineers from Motorola's worldwide software centers. We developed the system with staffing from six different countries. Next, we had to integrate the people into a team. While addressing this challenge, we identified key risk factors and developed approaches to reduce them. We separated the project risk factors into the five categories Carmel (1999) describes as the centrifugal forces that pull global projects apart.

However, in practical operation, there are many three-phase four-wired systems in distribution sites.

This paper presents a discussion concerning the influence of loop length (in direction of vehicle movement) on differences between characteristics describing the magnetic profiles of the vehicles belonging to the different classes. As characteristics describing the magnetic profile of the vehicle have been used: magnetic profiles in time domain (normalized in amplitude), probability density function and magnetic profiles in vehicle length domain. For real time applications, the conversion of the measured signal into a vector of numerical parameters (a few only) is also proposed.

As known, the fault arc resistance can be calculated by the Warrington formula. The authors investigated the results of Warrington's tests. Warrington derived a relation for the arc voltage by using the measured arc voltage gradient and arc current as input data. By analyzing these measurements and by taking into account the conditions under which they are obtained (inaccurate measurement devices), it is unquestionable that the results are highly empirical and not accurate and general enough. Laboratory testing, provided in the high power test laboratory FGH-Mannheim (Germany), in which long high current arcs are initiated, was the base for the research results presented. In this paper a new approach to arc resistance calculation is given. Two independent approaches delivered the same equation. Both approaches are based on a suitable and a simple arc model assuming the rectangular wave form of the arc voltage, which is in phase with the arc current wave form. The new formula for arc resistance is compared with the Warrington formula.

Thus, an accurate modeling method of HIF is essential for the development of a reliable detecting algorithm. The data should contain the complex characteristics of HIF such as buildup and shoulder as well as nonlinearity and asymmetry. This paper presents a modeling method of the above-mentioned HIF characteristics. Among the experiment data on a 22.9 (kV) distribution system conducted by Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO), experiment data showing all the above characteristics is chosen in this paper. Two series time-varying resistances (TVRs) controlled by transient analysis of control systems (TACS) in EMTP are employed for modeling. One TVR is used for nonlinearity and asymmetry from the voltage-current characteristic for one cycle in the steady state after HIF, and then the other TVR for buildup and shoulder from the waveforms in the transient state after HIF. The comparison of the modeling results with the experiment data shows close correspondence. With the developed HIF model, the voltage and current at the relaying point are obtained with various load condition and fault condition such as fault distance and inception angle.","","0-7803-7173-9","10.1109/PESS.2001.970231","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=970231","","Impedance;Voltage;Relays;Power system modeling;Fault detection;Power system reliability;Time varying systems;Transient analysis;Control system synthesis;EMTP","power distribution faults;electric impedance;fault location;EMTP","high impedance fault detection;time-varying resistance;distribution system;EMTP;current data;voltage data;relaying point;nonlinearity;asymmetry;buildup;shoulder;Korea Electric Power Corporation;series time-varying resistances;transient analysis of control systems;voltage-current characteristic;waveforms;transient state;load condition;fault condition;fault distance;inception angle;22.9 kV","","44","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The periodic model filter is obtained by replacing each delay in the prototype low-pass IIR filter by M delays. Masking filters are designed to eliminate unwanted bands from the periodic model filter or complementary periodic model filter. The transition bandwidth of the overall filter is M times smaller to that of the prototype filter. This technique can be used to design sharp low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, and band-stop filters. IIR model filters are implemented as low-sensitivity wave lattice digital filters (WDF-s) consisting of two all-pass branches in parallel. In all-pass sections, each delay is replaced with M delays to obtain periodic model filter. This way maximal sample frequency of the filter is M times increased.

On the other hand, the emergence of competitive power markets makes optimal power flow (OPF) with transient stability constraints increasingly important because the conventionally heuristic evaluation for the operation point can produce a discrimination among market players in the deregulated power systems. Instead of directly tackling this tricky problem, in this paper, OPF with transient stability constraints (OTS) is equivalently converted into an optimization problem in the Euclidean space via a constraint transcription, which can be viewed as an initial value problem for all disturbances and solved by any standard nonlinear programming techniques adopted by OPF. The transformed OTS problem has the same variables as those of OPF in form, and is tractable even for the large-scale power systems with a large number of transient stability constraints.

The calculation of the MSSLCs for merging or lane changing maneuvers is more complicated than the calculation of the minimum safety spacing for a longitudinal vehicle following since, in the former case we have to take into account the particular lane-changing policy of the merging vehicle as well as the effect of combined lateral/longitudinal motion during the lane changing maneuver. The braking profiles of the vehicles involved in an emergency scenario during a lane changing maneuver depends on the particular AHS operational concept, i.e., on the degree of communication between the vehicles and between the vehicles and the infrastructure.

For these devices, a general model, which is referred to as an injection model, is used. This model is valid for load flow and angle stability analysis and is helpful for understanding the impact of the CSD on power system stability. Also, based on Lyapunov theory a control strategy for damping of electromechanical power oscillations in a multi-machine power system is derived. Lyapunov theory deals with dynamical systems without inputs. For this reason, it has traditionally been applied only to closed-loop control systems, that is, systems for which the input has been eliminated through the substitution of a predetermined feedback control. However, in this paper, we use Lyapunov function candidates in feedback design itself by making the Lyapunov derivative negative when choosing the control.

Generally, in a system, not only s-independent failures but also s-dependent failures among components can occur; thus there are many studies where the s-dependencies among components are taken into account in system reliability and availability analysis, but in which the failure and repair rates were assumed constant. Whereas, from a practical viewpoint, the constant failure rate assumption for components has been, and is repeatedly challenged by knowledgeable reliability practitioners. Therefore, there are other studies which handled the problem of time-varying failure rates, among which all concerned repairable systems did not involve s-dependent failures. In most cases, however, to combine s-dependent failures and time-varying failure and repair rates in system reliability and availability analysis is the most appropriate for real systems. But it is very difficult to obtain the analytic solution and, in most cases, the closed-form solution for system reliability and availability does not exist, so that numerical or simulation methods must be used. This paper studies one kind of system that endures environmental shocks, and where one or more components can fail simultaneously due to a cumulative shock-damage process. An approach for reliability and availability analysis of such kinds of repairable systems is presented, where failure and repair rates of components can be varied with time. One type of special vehicle with such mechanical systems illustrates system reliability and availability solutions.","1558-1721","","10.1109/24.963122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=963122","","Availability;Reliability;Failure analysis;Time varying systems;Closed-form solution;Analytical models;Numerical simulation;Electric shock;Vehicles;Mechanical systems","reliability;maintenance engineering;failure analysis;time-varying systems","reliability;availability;time-varying failure rates;time-varying repair rates;s-independent failures;s-dependent failures;system reliability;availability analysis;constant failure rate assumption;repairable systems;time-varying failure;closed-form solution;environmental shocks;cumulative shock-damage process;mechanical systems;dependent components;Markov chain","","44","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Examples of future implants include neural and muscular stimulators, implantable drug delivery systems, intracorporal monitoring devices and body fluid control systems. The active microimplants demand a high degree of device miniaturization without compromising on design flexibility and biocompatibility requirements. With the need for integrating various microcomponents for a complex retina stimulator device, we have developed a novel technique for microassembly and high-density interconnects employing flexible, ultra-thin polymer based substrates. Pads for interconnections, conductive lines, and microelectrodes were embedded into the polyimide substrate as thin films. Photolithography and sputtering has been employed to pattern the microstructures. The novel ""MicroFlex interconnection (MFI)"" technology was developed to achieve chip size package (CSP) dimensions without the requirement of using bumped flip chips (FC). The MFI is based on a rivet like approach that yields an electrical and mechanical contact between the pads on the flexible polyimide substrate and the bare chips or electronic components. Center to center bond pad distances smaller than 100 /spl mu/m were accomplished. The ultra thin substrates and the MFI technology was proven to be biocompatible. Electrical and mechanical tests confirmed that interconnects and assembly of bare chips are reliable and durable. Based on our experience with the retina stimulator implant, we defined design rules regarding the flexible substrate, the bond pads, and the embedded conductive tracks. It is concluded that the MFI opens new venues for a novel generation of active implants with advanced sensing, actuation, and signal processing properties.","1557-9980","","10.1109/6040.938305","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=938305","","Assembly;Implants;Retina;Polyimides;Sputtering;Bonding;Pacemakers;Drug delivery;Monitoring;Control systems","prosthetics;biomedical electronics;chip scale packaging;photolithography;sputter deposition;neuromuscular stimulation;microassembling;biomedical electrodes","high density interconnects;flexible hybrid assemblies;active biomedical implants;muscular stimulators;neural stimulators;implantable drug delivery systems;intracorporal monitoring devices;body fluid control systems;device miniaturization;design flexibility;biocompatibility requirements;ultra-thin polymer based substrates;conductive lines;microelectrodes;photolithography;sputtering;MicroFlex interconnection;chip size package;bond pad distances;MFI technology;retina stimulator;conductive tracks;100 micron","","110","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper shows how the addition of an uncalibrated camera, aimed at the screen, solves both problems. Although the locations, orientations and optical parameters of the camera and projector are unknown, the projector-camera system calibrates itself by exploiting the homography between the projected slide and the camera image. Significant improvements are possible over passively calibrating systems since the projector actively manipulates the environment by placing feature points into the scene. For instance, using a low-resolution (160/spl times/120) camera, we can achieve an accuracy of /spl plusmn/3 pixels in a 1024/spl times/768 presentation slide. The camera-projector system infers models for the projector-to-camera and projector-to-screen mappings in order to provide two major benefits.","","0-7695-1143-0","10.1109/ICCV.2001.937525","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=937525","","Optical distortion;Cameras;Portable computers;Mice;Robots;Layout;Geometry;Hardware;Java;Application software","technical presentation;business graphics","smarter presentations;homography;camera-projector systems;orientations;optical parameters;projector-camera system","","114","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This new approach lends to solving convex optimization problems and also the model complexity follows from this solution. We especially focus on a least squares support vector machine formulation (LS-SVM) which enables to solve highly nonlinear and noisy black-box modelling problems, even in very high dimensional input spaces. While standard SVMs have been basically only applied to static problems like classification and function estimation, LS-SVM models have been extended to recurrent models and use in optimal control problems. Moreover, using weighted least squares and special pruning techniques, LS-SVMs can be employed for robust nonlinear estimation and sparse approximation.

Estimates of the complex channel gain and variance of the additive noise are derived first from known pilot symbols and an estimation filter. After each iteration of turbo decoding, the channel estimates are refined using information fed back from the decoder. Both hard-decision and soft-decision feedback are considered and compared with three baseline turbo-coded systems: (1) a BPSK system that has perfect channel estimates; (2) a system that uses differential phase shift keying and hence needs no estimates; and (3) a system that performs channel estimation using pilot symbols but has no feedback path from decoder to estimator. Performance can be further improved by borrowing channel estimates from the previously decoded frame. Simulation results show the influence of pilot symbol spacing, estimation filter size and type, and fade rate. Performance within 0.49 and 1.16 dB of turbo-coded BPSK with perfect coherent detection is observed at a bit-error rate of 10/sup -4/ for normalized fade rates of f/sub d/T/sub s/=0.005 and f/sub d/T/sub s/=0.02, respectively.","1558-0008","","10.1109/49.947034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=947034","","Channel estimation;Iterative decoding;Binary phase shift keying;Turbo codes;Phase estimation;Filters;Feedback;Phase detection;Phase frequency detector;Frequency shift keying","turbo codes;iterative decoding;parameter estimation;fading channels;noise;differential phase shift keying;feedback;decoding;signal detection;modulation coding;error statistics","iterative channel estimation;iterative decoding;pilot symbol assisted turbo codes;complex channel gain;coherent detection;turbo-coded binary phase shift keying;BPSK signals;frequency-flat fading channels;additive noise variance;pilot symbols;estimation filter;turbo decoding;hard-decision feedback;soft-decision feedback;BPSK system;perfect channel estimates;differential phase shift keying;performance;simulation results;pilot symbol spacing;estimation filter size;turbo-coded BPSK;bit-error rate;normalized fade rates;BER;Rayleigh channels;mobile communications","","218","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Greater attention has been paid to the reliability of solder joints and the assembly yield of the surface mounting process as use of advanced electronic packaging technologies has increased. The solder joint reliability has been observed to be highly dependent on solder joint geometry as well as solder material properties, such that predicting solder reflow shape became a critical issue for the electronic research community. In general, the truncated sphere method, the analytical solution and the energy-based algorithm are the three major methods for solder reflow geometry prediction. This research develops solder joint reliability design guidelines to accurately predict both the solder bump geometry and the standoff height for reflow soldered joints in area array packages. Three simulation methods such as truncated-sphere theory force-balanced analytical solution and energy-based approach for prediction of the solder bump geometry are each examined in detail, and the thermal enhanced BGA (TBGA) and flip chip packages are selected as the benchmark models to compare the simulation and experimental results.

All previously described, real-time methods fail to handle properly one or more common phenomena, such as global illumination changes, shadows, inter-reflections, similarity of foreground color to background and non-static backgrounds (e.g. active video displays or trees waving in the wind). The advent of hardware and software for real-time computation of depth imagery makes better approaches possible. We propose a method for modeling the background that uses per-pixel, time-adaptive, Gaussian mixtures in the combined input space of depth and luminance-invariant color. This combination in itself is novel, but we further improve it by introducing the ideas of (1) modulating the background model learning rate based on scene activity, and (2) making color-based segmentation criteria dependent on depth observations. Our experiments show that the method possesses much greater robustness to problematic phenomena than the prior state-of-the-art, without sacrificing real-time performance, making it well-suited for a wide range of practical applications in video event detection and recognition.","","0-7695-1293-3","10.1109/EVENT.2001.938860","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=938860","","Layout;Surveillance;Lighting;Robustness;Displays;Event detection;Milling machines;Hardware;Focusing;Reliability engineering","image segmentation;adaptive signal processing;image colour analysis;Gaussian processes;computer vision;video signal processing;image matching","foreground segmentation;adaptive mixture models;color imagery;luminance-invariant color;dynamic objects;background model learning rate;background subtraction;computer vision applications;surveillance;human-computer interaction;real-time methods;global illumination changes;shadows;inter-reflections;foreground color similarity;nonstatic backgrounds;active video displays;software;real-time computation;depth imagery;per-pixel Gaussian mixtures;time-adaptive Gaussian mixtures;scene activity;color-based segmentation;depth observations;video event detection;video event recognition;color matching","","114","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Analysis of beam-steering and directive characteristics of adaptive antenna arrays for mobile communications","V. Kallnichev","Samsung Electron. Co. Ltd., Kyungki, South Korea","IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","","2001","43","3","145","152","Radiation patterns of planar, circular, and three-segment adaptive antenna arrays are analyzed and compared in view of applications in mobile radio. It is assumed that each array consisted of several subarrays, which themselves present vertical linear arrays (columns) of patch radiators, with prescribed magnitude and phase distributions that determine the beam shape in the vertical (elevation) direction. Weighting signals applied to the subarray inputs provide beam steering in the horizontal (azimuth) plane. The scan-angle range and directive properties of such arrays are analyzed and simulated. For relatively small and moderate-sized base-station adaptive arrays, consisting of N=4, ..., 7 subarrays, the planar configuration may not be an appropriate choice, as the planar array has limited scan-angle range. Steering its beam toward the edges of a 120/spl deg/ sector leads to a rise in the grating lobe in the opposite azimuth direction, which, in turn, entails an additional decrease in antenna gain. Circular and three-segment configurations are good and relatively simple alternative variants. These have some degree of curvature, which allows beam steering in a wider angular range when compared to the planar geometry, although at the expense of a wider beam and lower directivity. Their geometrical parameters should be carefully chosen, so as to provide the required scans at the least loss in directivity. The three-segment form is closely related to its planar counterpart and, in some applications, may be more preferable than the circular form. For larger arrays, consisting of N/spl ges/8 subarrays, the planar geometry can attain the required 120/spl deg/ scans, and has advantages in directivity and gain when compared to any curved configuration.","1558-4143","","10.1109/74.934915","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=934915","","Phased arrays;Adaptive arrays;Directive antennas;Linear antenna arrays;Beam steering;Azimuth;Geometry;Antenna radiation patterns;Mobile antennas;Antenna arrays","adaptive antenna arrays;land mobile radio;planar antenna arrays;antenna radiation patterns;directive antennas;beam steering;linear antenna arrays;scanning antennas","beam-steering;directive characteristics;adaptive antenna arrays;mobile communications;radiation patterns;planar adaptive antenna arrays;circular adaptive antenna arrays;three-segment adaptive antenna arrays;mobile radio;subarrays;vertical linear arrays;patch radiator;phase distributions;beam shape;weighting signals;scan-angle range;base-station adaptive arrays;grating lobe;antenna gain","","20","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Multiuser communication allows vehicles, moorings, and bottom instruments to interact without human intervention to perform adaptive sampling tasks. In addition, multiuser communication may be used to send data from many autonomous users to one buoy with RF communications capability, which will then forward the information to shore. The two major signaling techniques for multiuser acoustic communication are phase-shift keying (PSK) direct-sequence spread-spectrum (DSSS) and frequency-shift keying (FSK) frequency-hopped spread-spectrum (FHSS). Selecting between these two techniques requires not only a study of their performance under multiuser conditions, but also an analysis of the impact of the underwater acoustic channel. In the case of DSSS, limitations in temporal coherence of the channel affect the maximum spreading factor, leading to situations that may be better suited to FHSS signals. Conversely, the multipath resolving properties of DSSS minimize the effects of frequency-selective fading that degrade the performance of FSK modulation. Two direct-sequence receivers potentially suitable for the underwater channel are presented. The first utilizes standard despreading followed by decision-directed gain and phase tracking. The second uses chip-rate adaptive filtering and phase tracking prior to despreading. Results from shallow water testing in two different scenarios are presented to illustrate the techniques and their performance.","1558-1691","","10.1109/48.972098","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=972098","","Frequency shift keying;Spread spectrum communication;Underwater acoustics;Phase shift keying;Underwater tracking;Underwater communication;Marine technology;Remotely operated vehicles;Instruments;Humans","underwater acoustic communication;spread spectrum communication;frequency hop communication;code division multiple access;frequency shift keying;multipath channels","multiuser underwater acoustic communication;autonomous ocean-sampling network;phase-shift keying direct-sequence spread-spectrum;frequency-shift keying frequency-hopped spread-spectrum;temporal coherence;multipath resolving properties;frequency-selective fading;direct-sequence receivers;decision-directed gain tracking;phase tracking;chip-rate adaptive filtering;despreading;shallow water testing;channel effects;CDMA;symbol-rate receiver","","90","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is done by using metal-thick-oxide (MTO) at the sidewalls of drift region. One can choose to have a higher blocking voltage or increase the background doping. A PiN structure, essentially identical to MOSFET during off state, was fabricated to demonstrate the proposed concept. Its measured BV/sub dss/ of 170 V is 2.5 times higher than measured conventional device BV/sub dss/ of 67 V on the same silicon wafer.","1558-0563","","10.1109/55.936359","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=936359","","Doping;Silicon;MOSFET circuits;Thickness control;Switching circuits;Electric breakdown;Gallium nitride;Fabrication;Voltage control;Power MOSFET","power MOSFET;semiconductor device breakdown;leakage currents;doping profiles;thickness control","oxide-bypassed VDMOS;oxide thickness control;high blocking voltage;high voltage MOS power devices;metal-thick-oxide;drift region sidewalls;PiN structure;silicon wafer;170 V","","50","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This approach produces a consistent set of transformations that have less pairwise registration error, i.e., better correspondence, than traditional methods that estimate the forward and reverse transformations independently. The transformations are estimated iteratively and are restricted to preserve topology by constraining them to obey the laws of continuum mechanics. The transformations are parameterized by a Fourier series to diagonalize the covariance structure imposed by the continuum mechanics constraints and to provide a computationally efficient numerical implementation. Results using a linear elastic material constraint are presented using both magnetic resonance and X-ray computed tomography image data. The results show that the joint estimation of a consistent set of forward and reverse transformations constrained by linear-elasticity give better registration results than using either constraint alone or none at all.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.932742","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=932742","","Image registration;Computed tomography;Magnetic resonance imaging;Magnetic materials;X-ray imaging;Biomedical imaging;Cities and towns;Topology;Fourier series;Magnetic resonance","image registration;medical image processing;Fourier series;biomedical MRI;computerised tomography","consistent image registration;reverse transformation;forward transformation;pairwise registration error;iterative estimation;topology preservation;continuum mechanics laws;covariance structure;linear elastic material constraint;MRI;CT;magnetic resonance imaging;medical diagnostic imaging","Algorithms;Brain;Brain;Fourier Analysis;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Mathematics;Tomography, X-Ray Computed","385","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An image is de-composed into two images: a reflectance image and an illumination image. Finding such a decomposition remains a difficult problem in computer vision. We focus on a slightly, easier problem: given a sequence of T images where the reflectance is constant and the illumination changes, can we recover T illumination images and a single reflectance image? We show that this problem is still imposed and suggest approaching it as a maximum-likelihood estimation problem. Following recent work on the statistics of natural images, we use a prior that assumes that illumination images will give rise to sparse filter outputs. We show that this leads to a simple, novel algorithm for recovering reflectance images.

Our model representation is based on two layers. The first one consists of ""generic"" descriptors which represent sets of similar rotational invariant feature vectors. Rotation invariance allows to group similar, but rotated patterns and makes the method robust to model deformations. The second layer is the joint probability on the frequencies of the ""generic"" descriptors over neighborhoods. This probability is multi-modal and is represented by a set of ""spatial-frequency"" clusters. It adds a statistical spatial constraint which is rotationally invariant. Our two-layer representation is novel; it allows to efficiently capture ""texture-like"" visual structure. The selection of distinctive structure determines characteristic model features (common to the positive and rare in the negative examples) and increases the performance of the model.

The model includes dielectric losses and mechanical losses in the transducer material layers as well as sound absorption in the transmission medium. First, the so-called constitutive relations of a piezoelectric body are derived based on general thermodynamic considerations, assuming that transducer operation takes place under almost isentropic conditions. Second, full attention is given to transducers oscillating in the thickness mode, discarding all other vibration modes. Dynamic transducer equations are determined using Newton's Second Law, Poisson's equation, and the definition of strain applied to a piezoelectric transducer with one or more non-piezoelectric layers on the front surface (multilayer transducer). Boundary conditions include continuity of normal velocity and stress across material interfaces as well as a subsidiary electrical condition over the piezoceramic electrodes. Sound transmission is assumed to take place in a water bath such that the Rayleigh equation can be used to obtain the incoming pressure at the receiver aperture from the acceleration of the opposing transmitter. This allows, e.g., a detailed treatment of receiver signal variations as the receiver moves from the near-field zone to the far-field zone of the transmitter. In the remaining part of the paper, receiver voltage and current signals are obtained by solving the full set of dynamic equations numerically. Special attention is given to transducers consisting of a) a pure piezoceramic layer only, b) a piezoceramic layer and a quarter-wavelength matching layer of polyphenylensulphide (PPS), c) a piezoceramic layer and a half-wavelength matching layer of stainless steel, and d) a piezoceramic layer and a half-wavelength matching layer of stainless steel tuned to resonance by a parallel inductance.

The basic premise of cost modeling is that a historical database of software project cost data can be used to develop a quantitative model to predict the cost of future projects. One of the difficulties faced by workers in this area is that many of these historical databases contain substantial amounts of missing data. Thus far, the common practice has been to ignore observations with missing data. In principle, such a practice can lead to gross biases and may be detrimental to the accuracy of cost estimation models. We describe an extensive simulation where we evaluate different techniques for dealing with missing data in the context of software cost modeling. Three techniques are evaluated: listwise deletion, mean imputation, and eight different types of hot-deck imputation. Our results indicate that all the missing data techniques perform well with small biases and high precision. This suggests that the simplest technique, listwise deletion, is a reasonable choice. However, this will not necessarily provide the best performance. Consistent best performance (minimal bias and highest precision) can be obtained by using hot-deck imputation with Euclidean distance and a z-score standardization.","1939-3520","","10.1109/32.962560","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=962560","","Costs;Predictive models;Size measurement;Productivity;Databases;Context modeling;Project management;Software performance;Euclidean distance;Standardization","software cost estimation;data integrity;database management systems","software cost estimation;cost modeling;database;software project cost data;quantitative model;missing data;simulation;listwise deletion;mean imputation;hot-deck imputation;incomplete data;Euclidean distance;z-score standardization;data quality","","108","","90","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, developing a deep understanding of these issues has proven to be a challenging task, since it in turn involves solving difficult problems such as mapping the actual topology, characterizing it, and developing models that capture its emergent behavior. Consequently, even though there are a number of topology models, it is an open question as to how representative the generated topologies they generate are of the actual Internet. Our goal is to produce a topology generation framework which improves the state of the art and is based on the design principles of representativeness, inclusiveness, and interoperability. Representativeness leads to synthetic topologies that accurately reflect many aspects of the actual Internet topology (e.g. hierarchical structure, node degree distribution, etc.). Inclusiveness combines the strengths of as many generation models as possible in a single generation tool.

Among the strains, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain 1912 was found to produce high alcohol concentrations during fermentation with high starting molasses concentrations such as 50% (WIV) molasses. In the test, 13.6% (V IV) alcohol was produced in the molasses fermentation broth after 72 h of incubation with an initial Yunnan molasses concentration of 50% in a 5 L fermentor. 15. 0% (V IV) alcohol was obtained after 48 h of fermentation in shaking flasks containing 30% (WIV) initial total sugar concentration in diluted molasses. The performance of this strain in the shaking flasks was successfully scaled up to a 5-L fermentor vessel.

The chip-scale packaging structure, termed die dimensional ball grid array (D/sup 2/BGA), eliminates wire bonds by using stacked solder joints to interconnect power chips. D/sup 2/BGA package consists of a power chip, inner solder caps, high-lead solder balls, and molding resin. It has the same lateral dimensions as the starting power chip, which makes high-density packaging and module miniaturization possible. This package enables the power chip to combine excellent thermal transfer, high current handling capability, improved electrical characteristics, and ultralow profile packaging. Electrical tests show that the V/sub CE/(sat) and on-resistance of the D/sup 2/BGA high speed insulated-gate-bipolar transistors (IGBTs) are improved by 20% and 30% respectively by eliminating the device wirebonds and other external interconnections, such as the leadframe. In this paper, we present the design, reliability, and processing issues of D/sup 2/BGA package, and the implementation of these chip-scale packaged power devices in building 30 kW half-bridge power converter modules.

We present a system based upon an acoustic ultrashort baseline system that allows the AUV to approach the dock from any direction. A passive latch on the AUV and a pole on the dock accomplish the task of mechanically docking the vehicle. We show that our technique for homing is extremely robust in the face of the two dominant sources of error-namely the presence of currents and the presence of magnetic anomalies. Our strategy for homing is independent of the initial bearing of the dock to the AUV, includes a method for detecting when the vehicle has missed the dock, and automatically ensures that the AUV is in a position to retry homing with a greater chance of success. Our approach is seen to be extremely successful in homing the vehicle to the dock, mechanically attaching itself to the dock, aligning inductive cores for data and power transfer, and undocking at the start of a fresh mission. Once the AUV is on the dock, we present a methodology that allows us to achieve the complex tasks with ensuring that the AUV is securely docked, periodically checking vehicle status, reacting to a vehicle that requires charging, tracking it when it is out on a mission, archiving and transmitting via satellite the data that the AUV collects during its missions, as well as providing a mechanism for researchers removed from the site to learn about vehicle status and command high-level missions. The dock is capable of long-term deployments at a remote site while respecting the constraints - low power, small size, low computational energy, low bandwidth, and little or no user input - imposed by the amalgamation of acoustic, electronic and mechanical components that comprise the entire system.","1558-1691","","10.1109/48.972084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=972084","","Oceans;Sampling methods;Vehicle detection;Underwater vehicles;Underwater acoustics;Remotely operated vehicles;Robustness;Face detection;Magnetic levitation;Joining processes","underwater vehicles;remotely operated vehicles;computerised navigation;underwater acoustic communication","autonomous ocean sampling network;AUV docking;acoustic ultrashort baseline system;passive latch;homing;magnetic anomalies;currents;tracking;long-term deployments;remote site;low computational energy;low bandwidth;algorithmic structure;acoustic modem;adaptive surveys;failure modes;reliability","","106","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

No.01CH37220)","","2001","","","255","263","Solder joint reliability has received a renewed interest since the inception of BGA and CSP type packages. While traditionally board level reliability during thermal and power cycling is considered important for most applications, solder joint failures due to board bending have also become a major reliability concern for portable applications. With the current trend of cheaper, faster, and better electronic equipment, it has become increasingly important to evaluate the package and system performance very early in the design cycle using simulation tools. Although a number of life prediction models for solder joint under thermal cycle conditions have been proposed in the literature, not enough work has been reported in extending these models to power and bend cycle simulations. The accuracy of life prediction tool has also become critically important, as the designs need to be evaluated and improved with high degree of confidence not through relative comparison but by providing absolute numbers. This paper describes in detail the life prediction model for solder joints for thermal cycle conditions and its extension to power and bend, cycle conditions. The approach uses advance finite element modeling and analysis techniques such as constraint equations and sub-structuring and is based on mechanics of deformation. The model has been correlated with more than 60 data points and predicts life within 25% in most cases. The framework of modeling and prediction methodology described here is fully applicable for developing life prediction models for Pb free solder also, once the deformation mechanisms are identified.","0569-5503","0-7803-7038-4","10.1109/ECTC.2001.927732","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=927732","","Soldering;Predictive models;Electronic packaging thermal management;Deformable models;Packaging machines;Power system reliability;Power system modeling;Chip scale packaging;Electronic equipment;System performance","reliability;ball grid arrays;soldering;chip scale packaging;bending;finite element analysis","solder joint reliability;thermal cycling;power cycling;bend cycling;BGA package;CSP package;board-level reliability;portable electronic equipment;design simulation;life prediction model;finite element analysis;deformation mechanics;lead-free solder","","63","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Conventional devices are grown by plasma assisted MBE on MOCVD GaN templates on sapphire. HBTs were fabricated on LEO material identifying threading dislocations as the primary source of collector-emitter leakage which was reduced by four orders of magnitude for devices on nondislocated material. Base doping studies show that the mechanism of this leakage is localized punch-through caused by compensation near the dislocation. High contact and lateral resistance in the base cause large parasitic common emitter offset voltages (from 1 to 5 V) in GaN HBTs. The effect of this voltage drop on common emitter characteristics is discussed. The combination of this voltage drop and the emitter collector leakage make Gummel and common base characteristics unreliable without verification with common emitter characteristics. The selectively regrown emitter bipolar transistor is presented with a DC current gain of 6 and early voltage greater than 400 V. The transistor operated to voltages over 70 V. This device design reduces base contact resistance, and circumvented difficulties associated with the emitter mesa etch process.

After considering the power capacity and cost, the hybrid power filter is the better choice for the future. Many passive power filters have already been installed in the industry power systems. However, the elements of these passive power filters are often destroyed due to the resonance or the harmonic current injection of a neighbouring harmonic source. To improve the performance of passive power filters, a small capacity of hybrid power filter is proposed to connect in parallel with the existing passive power filters.

Therefore, filtering techniques are investigated to reduce the motor terminal overvoltage, ringing, and EMI noise in inverter fed AC motor drive systems. The output filter is used to limit the rate of the inverter output voltage and reduce EMI (common mode noise) to the motor. The performance of the output filter is evaluated through simulations (PSIM) and experiment on PWM inverter-fed AC motor drive (3 phase, 3 HP (2.2 kW), input voltage 220/380 V, induction motor). An experimental PWM drive system reduction of conducted EMI was implemented on an available TMS320C31 microprocessor control board.

In this paper, sizing equations of the TORUS machines are derived using generalized sizing equations. The optimum machine design is illustrated by choosing the magnet pole-arc ratio and the skew angle of the rotor magnets. Using the optimum design data, field analysis of TORUS-NS and TORUS-S machines are investigated. Pulsating torque analyses including the cogging torque and the ripple torque are carried out using a 3D finite element analysis (FEA) software.

Dept., Carleton Univ., Ottawa, Ont., Canada; NA","IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","","2001","27","11","963","986","In the context of software cost estimation, system size is widely taken as a main driver of system development effort. However, other structural design properties, such as coupling, cohesion, and complexity, have been suggested as additional cost factors. Using effort data from an object-oriented development project, we empirically investigate the relationship between class size and the development effort for a class and what additional impact structural properties such as class coupling have on effort. The paper proposes a practical, repeatable, and accurate analysis procedure to investigate relationships between structural properties and development effort. Results indicate that fairly accurate predictions of class effort can be made based on simple measures of the class interface size alone (mean MREs below 30 percent). Effort predictions at the system level are even more accurate as, using Bootstrapping, the estimated 95 percent confidence interval for MREs is 3 to 23 percent. But, more sophisticated coupling and cohesion measures do not help to improve these predictions to a degree that would be practically significant. However, the use of hybrid models combining Poisson regression and CART regression trees clearly improves the accuracy of the models as compared to using Poisson regression alone.","1939-3520","","10.1109/32.965338","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=965338","","Object oriented modeling;Size measurement;Costs;Regression tree analysis;Time measurement;Predictive models;Context modeling;Software systems;Regression analysis;Buildings","software cost estimation;object-oriented programming;project management","development effort modeling;object-oriented systems;design properties;software cost estimation;system size;system development effort;structural design properties;cost factors;object-oriented development project;class size;impact structural properties;class coupling;accurate analysis procedure;structural properties;development effort;Poisson regression;regression trees;cost prediction models;design measures;regression analysis;class effort;Bootstrapping;MREs;CART regression trees;empirical validation","","71","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

ICCV 2001","","2001","1","","480","487 vol.1","Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) cameras are widely used imaging sensors in computer vision systems. Many photometric algorithms, such as shape from shading, color constancy and photometric stereo, implicitly assume that the image intensity is proportional to scene radiance. The actual image measurements deviate significantly from this assumption since the transformation from scene radiance to image intensity is non-linear and is a function of various factors including: noise sources in the CCD sensor, as well as various transformations occurring in the camera including: white balancing, gamma correction and automatic gain control. This paper illustrates how careful modeling of the error sources and the various processing steps enable us to accurately estimate the ""response function"", the inverse mapping from image measurements to scene radiance for a given camera exposure setting. It is shown that the estimation algorithm outperforms the calibration procedures known to us in terms of reduced bias and variance. Further, we demonstrate how the error modelling helps us to obtain uncertainty estimates of the camera irradiance value. The power of this uncertainty modeling is illustrated by a vision task involving High Dynamic Range image generation followed by change detection. Change can be detected reliably even in situation where the two images (the reference scene image and the current image) are taken several hours apart.","","0-7695-1143-0","10.1109/ICCV.2001.937555","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=937555","","Calibration;Charge coupled devices;Charge-coupled image sensors;Layout;Photometry;Cameras;Sensor systems;Computer vision;Shape;Colored noise","calibration;computer vision;CCD image sensors","CCD imaging;imaging sensors;computer vision;photometric algorithms;shape from shading;color constancy;photometric stereo;error sources;inverse mapping;estimation algorithm;calibration procedures;error modelling;uncertainty estimates;uncertainty modeling","","108","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a UML model of Web applications is proposed for their high-level representation. Such a model is the starting point for several analyses, which can help in the assessment of the static site structure. Moreover, it drives Web application testing, in that it can be exploited to define white-box testing criteria and to semi-automatically generate the associated test cases. The proposed techniques were applied to several real-world Web applications. The results suggest that automatic support for verification and validation activities can be extremely beneficial. In fact, it guarantees that all paths in the site which satisfy a selected criterion are properly exercised before delivery.

A fault detection algorithm has been developed to characterise the effects of supply imbalance and nonlinear motor effects (motor iron saturation, winding imbalance, rotor static eccentricity), which also generate negative sequence current. The effects of motor heating and variation in negative sequence resistance with slip change are minimised by using only motor negative sequence reactance to calculate supply negative sequence current. Change in the motor negative sequence impedance under supply imbalance due to load variation (mainly because of closed rotor slots effect) has been included. Experimental results on several motors show that negative sequence impedance can vary between 10% to 50%. Semiempirical formulas based on theoretical and experimental results have been proposed to eliminate the effects of supply imbalance, load, and voltage variation.

Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, USA","IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","","2001","1","1","43","59","The microelectronics industry owes its considerable success largely to the existence of the thermal oxide of silicon. However, recently there is concern that the reliability of ultra-thin dielectrics will limit further scaling to slightly thinner than 2 mm. This paper will review the physics and statistics of dielectric wearout and breakdown in ultrathin SiO/sub 2/-based gate dielectrics. Electrons or holes tunneling through the gate oxide generate defects until a critical density is reached and the oxide breaks down. The critical defect density is explained by the formation of a percolation path of defects across the oxide. Only <1% of these paths ultimately lead to destructive breakdown, and the microscopic nature of these defects is not known. The rate of defect generation decreases approximately exponentially with supply voltage, below a threshold voltage of about 5 V for hot electron-induced hydrogen release. However, the tunnel current also increases exponentially with decreasing oxide thickness, leading to a decreasing time-to-breakdown and a diminishing margin for reliability as device dimensions are scaled. Estimating the reliability of the dielectric requires an extrapolation from the measurement conditions (e.g., higher voltage) to operation conditions. Because of the diminished reliability margin. it has become imperative to try to reduce the error in this extrapolation, Long-term (>1 year) stress experiments are now being used to measure the wearout and breakdown of ultrathin (<2 nm) dielectric films as close as possible to operating conditions. These measurements have revealed the details of the voltage dependence of the defect generation rate and critical defect density, allowing better modeling of the voltage dependence of the time-to-breakdown, Such measurements are used to guide the technology development prior to the manufacturing stage. We then discuss the nature of the electrical conduction through a breakdown spot and the effect of the oxide breakdown on device and circuit performance. In some cases, an oxide breakdown does not lead to immediate circuit failure, so more research is needed in order to develop a quantitative methodology for predicting the reliability of circuits.","1558-2574","","10.1109/7298.946459","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=946459","","Predictive models;Electric breakdown;Dielectric measurements;Dielectric breakdown;Threshold voltage;Lead compounds;Extrapolation;Density measurement;Circuits;Microelectronics","integrated circuit modelling;integrated circuit reliability;CMOS integrated circuits;semiconductor device breakdown;percolation;hot carriers;tunnelling;failure analysis","predictive models;ultrathin oxide reliability;CMOS devices;dielectric wearout;dielectric breakdown;critical defect density;percolation path;threshold voltage;hot electron-induced hydrogen release;tunnel current;time-to-breakdown;long-term stress experiments;operating conditions;voltage dependence;defect generation rate;breakdown spot;circuit failure;physical models;5 V;1 yr;2 nm;SiO/sub 2/","","138","","198","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is suitable for application in grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) generation plants due to the intrinsic ability to perform maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of the PV array. Furthermore, the transient response time is of the order of a few PWM sampling periods, therefore the energy storage requirements of the DC capacitor are significantly reduced, and a small nonelectrolytic type can be employed. Considering that the DC buffer capacitor of an inverter is often the limiting factor in terms of reliability, the proposed approach can lead to a substantial improvement in the way the entire system is perceived. The technique has similar harmonic performance to regularly sampled PWM, with a fixed switching frequency and low current distortion, and operates at unity power factor. This predictive method avoids problems of stability and loop interactions present in controllers employing cascaded DC voltage and AC current feedback loops. The theory of the algorithm is presented in this paper, together with simulation results.","","0-7803-7108-9","10.1109/IECON.2001.975597","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=975597","","Predictive control;Pulse width modulation;Voltage control;Pulse width modulation inverters;Capacitors;Photovoltaic systems;Solar power generation;Mesh generation;Power generation;Transient response","photovoltaic power systems;solar cell arrays;PWM invertors;voltage control;electric current control;predictive control;transient response;feedback;stability;capacitance","predictive control scheme;DC voltage control;AC current control;grid-connected photovoltaic inverters;minimum DC link capacitance;three-phase inverters;maximum power point tracking;MPPT;PV array;PWM sampling periods;transient response time;energy storage requirements;DC capacitor;nonelectrolytic type;DC buffer capacitor;reliability;harmonic performance;fixed switching frequency;low current distortion;unity power factor;predictive method;loop interactions;stability;feedback loops","","30","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

After the derivation of a realistic nonlinear differential equation model, a linearized plant transfer function is developed. The effects of nonlinearities are accounted for by describing the linearized model parameters as structured uncertainty. The impact of environmental variability as well as variations in hydraulic component parameters are also included as uncertainty in the model. The QFT design procedure is carried out to design a robust controller that satisfies performance specifications for tracking and disturbance rejection.

Physical behavior of the resulting model entails that it should absorb active power for any set of applied voltages, at any frequency. This requires the real part of Y to be positive definite (PD). We calculate a correction to the rational approximation of Y which enforces the PD-criterion to be satisfied. The correction is minimal with respect to the fitting error. The method is based on linearization and constrained minimization by quadratic programming. Examples show that models not satisfying the PD-criterion can lead to an unstable simulation, even though the rational approximation has stable poles only. Enforcement of the PD-criterion is demonstrated to give a stable result.","1558-0679","","10.1109/59.910786","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910786","","Admittance;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Least squares approximation;Power system transients;Frequency domain analysis;Power system modeling;Power system simulation;Voltage;Error correction;Minimization methods","matrix algebra;power system transients;electric admittance;quadratic programming;frequency-domain analysis","admittance matrices;passivity enforcement;rational functions;linear power system component;transient simulation;terminal equivalent;admittance matrix;frequency domain;active power absorption;fitting error;quadratic programming;linearization;constrained minimization","","302","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Vehicle orientation becomes increasingly important in the final stages of the docking, as large changes in orientation near the dock are impractical and often not possible. A number of homing technologies have been proposed and tested, with acoustic homing the most prevalent. If AUV orientation is required as well as bearing and distance to the dock, an acoustic homing system will require high update rates, and extensive signal conditioning. An Electromagnetic Homing (EM) system is one alternative that can provide accurate measurement of the AUV position and orientation to the dock during homing. This system offers inherent advantages in defining the AUV orientation, when compared to high frequency acoustic systems. The design and testing of an EM homing system are given, with particular attention to one can be adapted to a wide class of AUVs. A number of homing, docking, and latching trials were successfully performed with the design.

In this drive system, the simultaneous estimation of the rotor speed and time constant for a voltage source inverter-fed induction motor is discussed. The theory is based on the parallel Model Reference Adaptive Control System (MRAC). The vector control of the induction motor may be achieved in the rotor-flux-oriented frame. Furthermore, to eliminate the offset error caused by the change in the stator resistance, a fuzzy resistance is also designed.

This direction finding algorithm may (under most circumstances) resolve up to four uncorrelated monochromatic sources impinging from the near-field or the far-field, but it assumes that all signal frequencies are distinct. It requires no a priori knowledge of the signals' frequencies, suffers no frequency-DOA ambiguity, and pairs automatically the x-axis direction cosines with the y-axis direction cosines. It significantly outperforms an array of spatially displaced pressure hydrophones of comparable array-manifold size and computational load but may involve more complex hardware.

Wireless nodes have the unique capability of transmission at different power levels. As the transmission power is varied, a tradeoff exists between the number of hops from source to destination and the overall bandwidth available to individual nodes. Because both battery life and channel bandwidth are limited resources in mobile networks, it is important to ascertain the effects different transmission powers have on the overall performance of the network. This paper explores the nature of this transmission power tradeoff in mobile networks to determine the optimum node density for delivering the maximum number of data packets. It is shown that there does not exist a global optimum density, but rather that, to achieve this maximum, the node density should increase as the rate of node movement increases.","","0-7803-7097-1","10.1109/ICC.2001.937360","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=937360","","Bandwidth;Routing protocols;Mobile computing;Batteries;Packet radio networks;Mobile communication;Computer science;Wireless communication;Unicast","mobile radio;packet radio networks;telecommunication network routing","optimum node density;mobile ad hoc networks;wireless channels;transmission power;available bandwidth;transmission power tradeoff;data packets;node mobility;ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing;mobile network performance","","259","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, the authors model TQM as an organizational innovation. Using the innovation diffusion perspective from the information systems and organizational innovation literature, they theorize that TQM implementation translates top management's quality intent into plant-level operational performance through a four-stage process of adoption, adaptation, acceptance, and use. The top management adopts the TQM philosophy in the first stage. This commitment influences the adaptation of the organizational members' ability and attitude to the new quality management philosophy. In the acceptance stage, the organizational members demonstrate acceptance of the new quality focus through cooperative teamwork, relationships with suppliers, and quality-related learning. The diffusion of the new philosophy is confirmed through routinization of core quality improvement through effective design, tracking, assurance, and improvement of quality. The four-stage transformation process leads to plant-level measures of product and process quality. The authors tested this framework on a sample of 407 plants in the automobile parts suppliers industry and found good support for the model. Their results suggest that firms should ensure appropriate technical and behavioral preparation of employees and suppliers before and concurrent to actual TQM implementation. Furthermore, the results also suggest that firms should implement TQM in an integrated fashion covering all sociotechnical elements detailed in their framework. Implications of these findings for TQM practice and research are discussed.","1558-0040","","10.1109/17.969423","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=969423","","Manufacturing","quality management;human resource management;manufacturing industries;management of change","TQM implementation;innovation diffusion model;causal relationships;total quality management;organizational innovation;quality intent;plant-level operational performance;adoption stage;adaptation stage;acceptance stage;use stage;top management;quality management philosophy;cooperative teamwork;quality-related learning;supplier relationships;core quality improvement;automobile parts suppliers industry;employees;theory development","","79","","138","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In our framework, the measurement of similarity is preceded by (1) solving for correspondences between points on the two shapes, (2) using the correspondences to estimate an aligning transform. In order to solve the correspondence problem, we attach a descriptor, the shape context, to each point. The shape context at a reference point captures the distribution of the remaining points relative to it, thus offering a globally discriminative characterization. Corresponding points on two similar shapes will have similar shape contexts, enabling us to solve for correspondences as an optimal assignment problem. Given the point correspondences, we estimate the transformation that best aligns the two shapes; regularized thin-plate splines provide a flexible class of transformation maps for this purpose. Dis-similarity between two shapes is computed as a sum of matching errors between corresponding points, together with a term measuring the magnitude of the aligning transform. We treat recognition in a nearest-neighbor classification framework.

This paper describes a multipath adaptive traffic engineering mechanism, called MATE, which is targeted for switched networks such as multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) networks. The main goal of MATE is to avoid network congestion by adaptively balancing the load among multiple paths based on measurement and analysis of path congestion. MATE adopts a minimalist approach in that intermediate nodes are not required to perform traffic engineering or measurements besides normal packet forwarding. Moreover MATE does not impose any particular scheduling, buffer management, or a priori traffic characterization on the nodes. This paper presents an analytical model, derives a class of MATE algorithms, and proves their convergence. Several practical design techniques to implement MATE are described. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the efficacy of MATE under various network scenarios.","0743-166X","0-7803-7016-3","10.1109/INFCOM.2001.916625","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=916625","","Multiprotocol label switching;Telecommunication traffic;Routing;Traffic control;Reliability engineering;IP networks;Web and internet services;Communications technology;Rivers;Performance evaluation","Internet;telecommunication traffic;packet switching;telecommunication congestion control","MPLS adaptive traffic engineering;MATE;destination-based forwarding;IP routers;Internet service provider networks;traffic patterns;multipath adaptive traffic engineering mechanism;multiprotocol label switching;network congestion;load balancing;minimalist approach;packet forwarding;convergence;design techniques","","226","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Trends in power semiconductor technology indicate a trade-off in the selection of power devices in terms of switching frequency and voltage sustaining capability.

In this paper, a novel technique is proposed for estimating DCCM using uplink channel responses only, which does not need direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation and its association. The downlink beamforming scheme is then proposed for wireless DS-CDMA systems, using the obtained DCCM information together with the so-called virtual uplink beamforming and power control technique.

The generator phase inductance is big enough so no extra DC inductor is required. The electrical system is modeled using the power electronics and motor control software package PSIM, then a current controller is designed. Its steady state and transient performance shows that the generator phase inductance helps to smooth the generator phase current with a reasonable lagging angle. Furthermore, a simple current-torque model is derived for the electrical system. This model together with that of the mechanical system enables the design of the speed control loop based on the turbine tip speed ratio (TSR), the ratio of the blade tip speed to the wind speed. The simulation result based on MATLAB/SIMULINK shows the power tracking with wind variation.

Relative to single-bit quantization, multibit quantization significantly relaxes the analog circuit performance necessary to achieve a given level of data converter precision, but significant digital logic is required to perform the mismatch shaping. In modern very large scale integration processes optimized for digital circuitry, this tends to be a good tradeoff in terms of both area and power consumption. It is nonetheless desirable to minimize the digital complexity as much as possible. Moreover, in delta-sigma analog-to-digital converters the mismatch-shaping logic is in the feedback path of the delta-sigma modulator, so it is essential to maintain a sufficiently small propagation delay through the mismatch-shaping logic. This paper presents and analyzes several variations of the switching blocks within a tree-structured mismatch-shaping DAC that result in the most hardware-efficient first-order and second-order mismatch-shaping DAC implementations yet known to the authors. The variations presented allow designers to tradeoff complexity for propagation-delay reduction so as to tailor designs to specific applications.","1558-125X","","10.1109/82.982352","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=982352","","Quantization;Delta modulation;Analog-digital conversion;Digital-analog conversion;Digital modulation;Analog circuits;Logic circuits;Very large scale integration;Energy consumption;Feedback","delta-sigma modulation;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;circuit complexity;logic partitioning;tree data structures;quantisation (signal)","first-order mismatch-shaping DAC;second-order mismatch-shaping DAC;simplified logic;delta-sigma modulation;tree-structured converter;delta-sigma data converters;multibit quantization;digital complexity;mismatch-shaping logic;feedback path;small propagation delay;switching blocks;propagation-delay reduction;coarse quantization;functional partitioning;medium-speed implementations;high-speed implementations;delayed switched-capacitor integrators;tree-structured digital encoder;low-pass sequencing logic;splitting network;parity logic","","30","","52","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

No.01CH37228)","","2001","5","","4877","4882 vol.5","A new digital control solution to motion control problems is proposed. It is based on a unique active disturbance rejection concept, where the, disturbances are estimated using an extended state observer (ESO) and compensated in each sampling period. The dynamic compensation reduces the motion system to approximately a double integrator which can be easily controlled using a nonlinear proportional-derivative (PD) controller. The proposed active disturbance-rejection controller (ADRC) consists of the ESO and the nonlinear PD controller and is designed without an explicit mathematical model of the plant. Hence, the controller is inherently robust against plant variations. Through the simulation, frequency response analysis, and hardware tests, it is shown that the proposed approach is superior to the current PID based technology. It stands out especially in handling set point change, large inertia and friction variations, and external torque disturbance, all of which is seen as ""disturbance"" by ADRC and is actively compensated. The improvement in transient response and steady state error is also quite evident.","","0-7803-7061-9","10.1109/CDC.2001.980980","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=980980","","Motion control;PD control;Nonlinear control systems;Proportional control;Control systems;Digital control;State estimation;Observers;Sampling methods;Nonlinear dynamical systems","motion control;digital control;nonlinear control systems;two-term control;observers;frequency response;transient response;compensation;control system synthesis","digital control;motion control;active disturbance rejection;state observer;dynamic compensation;nonlinear control systems;PD controller;frequency response;transient response","","19","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The question, which is answered here, is ""What percentage of the defects in D/sub 1/ will be detected if a random subset of the tests in T/sub 1/ are applied to the code, which has code coverage of X% of the code?"" The purpose of this paper is to show the relation between code quality and code coverage. The relationship is derived via a model of code defect levels. A sampling technique is employed and modeled with the hypergeometric distribution while assuming uniform probability and a random distribution of defects in the code, which invokes the binomial distribution. The result of this analysis is a simple relation between defect level and quality of the code delivered after the unit code is tested.

A stability index is developed that indicates the severity of the loading situation of the system. The index can have a maximum value of one (1.00) when the system is at the point of collapse and a minimum value of zero (0) when there is no load in the system. Voltage collapse can be assessed based on the value of the developed index. If the system yields a value exceeding its maximum limit of stability index (1.00) it indicates a voltage collapse situation. The proposed technique is tested on a practical system of a 12-bus radial system (main feeders only) and on a 27-bus radial distribution system with laterals.

The proposed algorithm combines the variable step-size numerical integration method with linear interpolation for the synchronization of a real-time digital simulator and a digital controller. It is shown that lack of such synchronization leads to inaccurate simulation results, specifically with regard to the fundamental and harmonics of the voltage and current signals.

Unfortunately, as more images are added, the prevalence of semi-occluded regions (pixels visible in some but not all images) also increases. We propose some novel techniques to deal with this problem. Our first idea is to use a combination of shiftable windows and a dynamically selected subset of the neighboring images to do the matches. Our second idea is to explicitly label occluded pixels within a global energy minimization framework, and to reason about visibility within this framework so that only truly visible pixels are matched.

The proposed method for the digital watermarking is based on the wavelet transform. This is unlike most previous work, which used a random number of a sequence of bits as a watermark and where the watermark can only be detected by comparing an experimental threshold value to determine whether a sequence of random signals is the watermark. The proposed approach embeds a watermark with visual recognizable patterns, such as binary, gray, or color image in images by modifying the frequency part of the images. In the proposed approach, an original image is decomposed into wavelet coefficients. Then, multi-energy watermarking scheme based on the qualified significant wavelet tree (QSWT) is used to achieve the robustness of the watermarking. Unlike other watermarking techniques that use a single casting energy, QSWT adopts adaptive casting energy in different resolutions. The performance of the proposed watermarking is robust to a variety of signal distortions, such as JPEG, image cropping, sharpening, median filtering, and incorporating attacks.","1557-9948","","10.1109/41.954550","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=954550","","Watermarking;Wavelet transforms;Energy resolution;Signal resolution;Robustness;Casting;Accreditation;Pattern recognition;Image recognition;Color","copy protection;discrete wavelet transforms;image processing;security of data","digital watermarks hiding;multiresolution wavelet transform;image accreditation technique;embedded digital watermarks;visual recognizable patterns;color image;gray image;binary image;wavelet coefficients;multi-energy watermarking scheme;qualified significant wavelet tree;single casting energy;adaptive casting energy;signal distortions;JPEG compression;image cropping;image sharpening;median filtering;discrete wavelet transform","","195","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An innovative control method substitutes conventional hardware, such as an active front-end rectifier or a chopper controlled braking resistor in the DC-link circuit, by additional software that is implemented in the standard microprocessor control. The control algorithm maximizes the power losses in the machine and in the inverter. It enables regenerative braking operation of the induction motor at high torque.

Forward and inverse kinematic analyses are performed and the Jacobian matrix is derived. Performance indexes such as global payload index, global conditioning index, translation and orientation workspaces, and sensitivity are evaluated to find optimal parameters in the design stage. The proposed haptic mechanism has better load capability than those of the pre-existing haptic mechanisms due to the fact that the motors are fixed at the base. It has also a wider orientation workspace mainly due to a RRR-type spherical joint. A control method is presented with gravity compensation and force feedback by a force/torque sensor to compensate for the effects of unmodeled dynamics such as friction and inertia. Also, the dynamic performance is evaluated for force characteristics.

The proposed voltage regulator has the capability of delivering sinusoidal input current with unity power factor, good output voltage regulation, and bidirectional power flow. For these purposes, a fully digital controller is designed and implemented using a TMS320F240 digital signal processor. In addition, a novel low-cost AC capacitor is also presented. This type of capacitor requires two DC capacitors and two diodes, enabling low-cost and compact manufacturing.

Long-throw rectilinear displacements were achieved by inchworm mechanisms in which pairs of opposing actuators grip and shift a central shank that is cantilevered on a flexible suspension. A passive lock holds the displaced shank between pushes and when the power is off.

These physical methods use system-based controls to verify the identity of a person or process, explicitly enabling or restricting the ability to use, change, or view a computer resource. However, these strategies are inadequate for the increased flexibility that distributed networks such as the Internet and pervasive computing environments require because such systems lack central control and their users are not all predetermined. Mobile users expect to access locally hosted resources and services anytime and anywhere, leading to serious security risks and access control problems. We propose a solution based on trust management that involves developing a security policy, assigning credentials to entities, verifying that the credentials fulfill the policy, delegating trust to third parties, and reasoning about users' access rights. This architecture is generally applicable to distributed systems but geared toward pervasive computing environments.","1558-0814","","10.1109/2.970591","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=970591","","Pervasive computing;Access control;Control systems;Computer networks;Authentication;Computer security;Physics computing;IP networks;Centralized control;Permission","security of data;mobile computing;transport protocols;distributed processing;authorisation","trust management;security policy;credentials;third parties;access rights;distributed systems;pervasive computing environments;mobile users;security;Centaurus","","83","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Cumulants can be associated with a stationary signal model or with a cyclostationary signal model, in which case they are periodically time-varying with Fourier components called cyclic cumulants. These researchers limit the maximum order to four, and it is commonly believed that sixth- and higher-order cumulants provide no additional benefit due to their relatively large measurement-error variance. However, we have observed experimentally that classification performance can be improved by the use of sixth-order cyclic cumulants. In this paper, we present the results of a simulation study of the cumulant variance for signals corrupted by cochannel interference and AWGN.

We apply the MDTs to an ERP data set, and thereafter construct regression-based prediction models using the resulting data sets. The evaluation suggests that only FIML is appropriate when the data are not missing completely at random (MCAR). Unlike FIML, prediction models constructed on LD, MI and SRPI data sets will be biased unless the data are MCAR. Furthermore, compared to LD, MI and SRPI seem appropriate only if the resulting LD data set is too small to enable the construction of a meaningful regression-based prediction model.","1939-3520","","10.1109/32.965340","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=965340","","Data analysis;Predictive models;Costs;Enterprise resource planning;Maximum likelihood estimation;Software engineering;Information analysis;Context modeling;Software standards;Databases","data analysis;software cost estimation;maximum likelihood estimation;statistical analysis","data set analysis;biased prediction models;missing data techniques;MDTs;software cost modeling;listwise deletion;mean imputation;similar response pattern imputation;information maximum likelihood;ERP data set;regression-based prediction models;FIML;missing completely at random;MCAR;SRPI data sets;regression-based prediction model;LD;MI;software effort prediction models","","126","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The goal of image compression is to represent an image with as few number of bits as possible while preserving the quality required for the given application. Standard lossless compression schemes can only yield compression ratios of about 2:1 that is insufficient to compress volumetric tomographic image data. Common standards available in industry for lossy image compression are usually used in non-medical applications and their application to medical image compression is still under investigation. Fractal image coding is a new compression technique that has received much attention recently. This study investigates the feasibility of applying fractal image coding approach to nuclear medicine image compression. A quadtree-based partition scheme was used in the encoding phase to partition an image frame into small irregular segments that after decoding process, yield an approximate image to the original. Our preliminary results show that compression ratios higher than 10:1 can be achieved in clinical images. It was also found that there is no diagnostic loss in the parametric images computed from the reconstructed images as compared to those obtained from the original raw data. We conclude that fractal image coding could be used to compress tomographic images and it may be useful in telemedicine.","1082-3654","0-7803-7324-3","10.1109/NSSMIC.2001.1008593","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1008593","","Image coding;Fractals;Tomography;Biomedical imaging;Medical diagnostic imaging;Nuclear medicine;Image segmentation;Decoding;Image reconstruction;Telemedicine","image coding;data compression;fractals;emission tomography;medical image processing","emission tomographic image compression;fractal image coding;medical image compression;compression ratios;lossy image compression;nuclear medicine;quadtree-based partition scheme;telemedicine","","1","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The nonhomogeneous environment may consist of nonstationary clutter and could include blinking jammers. The D/sup 3/ approach is applied to data collected by an antenna array utilizing space and in time (Doppler) diversity. Conventional STAP generally utilizes statistical methodologies based on estimating a covariance matrix of the interference using data from secondary range cells. As the results are derived from ensemble averages, one filter (optimum in a probabilistic sense) is obtained for the operational environment, assumed to be wide sense stationary. However for highly transient and inhomogeneous environments the conventional statistical methodology is difficult to apply. Hence, the D/sup 3/ method is presented as it analyzes the data in space and time over each range cell separately. The D/sup 3/ method is deterministic in approach. From an operational standpoint, an optimum method could be a combination of these two diverse methodologies. This paper represents several new D/sup 3/ approaches. One is based on the computation of a generalized eigenvalue for the signal strength and the others are based on the solution of a set of block Hankel matrix equations. Since the matrix of the system of equations to be solved has a block Hankel structure, the conjugate gradient method and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) can be utilized for efficient solution of the adaptive problem. Illustrative examples presented in this paper use measured data from the multichannel airborne radar measurements (MCARM) database to detect a Sabreliner in the presence of urban, land, and sea clutter. An added advantage for the D/sup 3/ method in solving real-life problems is that simultaneously many realizations can be obtained for the same solution for the signal of interest (SOI). The degree of variability amongst the different results can provide a confidence level of the processed results. The D/sup 3/ method may also be used for mobile communications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/8.910535","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910535","","Clutter;Statistical analysis;Equations;Sea measurements;Signal processing;Jamming;Antenna arrays;Covariance matrix;Interference;Filters","space-time adaptive processing;least squares approximations;jamming;diversity reception;land mobile radio;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Hankel matrices;conjugate gradient methods;fast Fourier transforms;airborne radar;radar signal processing;radar clutter","deterministic least-squares;space-time adaptive processing;STAP;direct data domain;adaptive signal enhancement;nonhomogeneous environment;nonstationary clutter;blinking jammers;antenna array;Doppler diversity;space diversity;time diversity;statistical methodologies;covariance matrix estimation;interference;secondary range cells;transient environment;range cell;deterministic method;generalized eigenvalue;signal strength;block Hankel matrix equations;conjugate gradient method;fast Fourier transform;FFT;multichannel airborne radar measurements database;MCARM database;Sabreliner detection;urban clutter;land clutter;sea clutter;mobile communications","","116","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents a robust hysteresis current-controlled PWM scheme for a magnetic suspended positioning system driven by an inverter-fed linear permanent-magnet synchronous motor having improved performance in these two areas. In the proposed control scheme, the conventional hysteresis PWM mechanism is augmented by a robust harmonic spectrum-shaping controller. The error signal, which represents the switching frequency deviated from the set one, is detected using a notching filter inverse model. Then, the current command is adjusted by a robust compensation signal. The hysteresis band can be equivalently varied to let the dominant harmonic frequency of inverter output be constant, wherein the frequency can easily be changed by tuning the center frequency of the notch filter. The gating signal of switches is not needed to be sensed for making the proposed control. The constant-frequency control performance yielded by the proposed controller is rather insensitive to the system disturbances and the neutral voltage variation due to isolated Y connection. Through applying the proposed PWM inverter, satisfactory position control requirements can be achieved by properly setting the dominant harmonic frequency according to the electromechanical model of the positioning system.","1557-9948","","10.1109/41.954560","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=954560","","Robustness;Pulse width modulation inverters;Pulse width modulation;Magnetic hysteresis;Power harmonic filters;Switching frequency;Voltage control;Control systems;Space vector pulse width modulation;Servomechanisms","permanent magnet motors;synchronous motor drives;robust control;linear synchronous motors;magnetic levitation;position control;machine control;compensation;notch filters;frequency control;PWM invertors;magnetic hysteresis","robust hysteresis current-controlled PWM inverter;linear PMSM driven magnetic suspended positioning system;nonconstant switching frequency;high-performance position servo applications;magnetic suspended positioning system;inverter-fed linear permanent-magnet synchronous motor;conventional hysteresis PWM mechanism;robust harmonic spectrum-shaping controller;error signal;notching filter inverse model;current command;robust compensation signal;hysteresis band;dominant harmonic frequency;inverter output;center frequency tuning;notch filter;gating signal;constant-frequency control performance;neutral voltage variation;isolated Y connection;PWM inverter;position control;electromechanical model;positioning system","","30","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There are several advantages of the proposed CDMA architecture compared to conventional CDMA systems pertinent to current 2G and 3G standards. First of all, it can achieve a spreading efficiency (SE) very close to one (the SE is defined as the amount of information bit(s) conveyed by each chip); whereas SEs of conventional CDMA systems equal 1/N, where N denotes the length of spreading codes. Second, it offers MAI-free operation in both upand downlink transmissions in an MAI-AWGN channel, which can significantly reduce the co-channel interference responsible for capacity decline of a CDMA system. Third, the proposed CDMA architecture is able to offer a high bandwidth efficiency due to the use of its unique spreading modulation scheme and orthogonal carriers. Lastly, the proposed CDMA architecture is particularly suited to multirate signal transmission due to the use of an offset stacked spreading modulation scheme, which simplifies the rate-matching algorithm relevant to multimedia services and facilitates asymmetric traffic in up- and downlink transmissions for IP-based applications. Based on the above characteristics and the obtained results, it is concluded that the proposed CDMA architecture has a great potential for applications in future wideband mobile communications beyond 3G, which is expected to offer a very high data rate in hostile mobile channels.","1558-1896","","10.1109/35.956124","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=956124","","Multiaccess communication;Downlink;Digital modulation;Modulation coding;Signal design;Signal detection;Interchannel interference;Bandwidth;Wideband;3G mobile communication","code division multiple access;spread spectrum communication;codes;radio networks;broadband networks;land mobile radio;cochannel interference;multiuser channels;transport protocols;AWGN channels;radio links;telecommunication signalling;multipath channels","multicarrier CDMA architecture;orthogonal complementary codes;wideband wireless communications;uplink signaling design;downlink signaling design;digital receiver;multipath signal detection;3G standards;2G standards;spreading efficiency;spreading code length;MAI-free operation;MAI-AWGN channel;co-channel interference reduction;high bandwidth efficiency;multirate signal transmission;offset stacked spreading modulation;rate-matching algorithm;multimedia services;asymmetric traffic;IP-based applications;wideband mobile communications;hostile mobile channels;multipath channels","","170","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

A reliable and practical measure of prediction confidence is essential. In this work three alternative approaches to prediction confidence estimation are presented and compared. The three methods are the maximum likelihood, approximate Bayesian, and the bootstrap technique. We consider prediction uncertainty owing to both data noise and model parameter misspecification. The methods are tested on a number of controlled artificial problems and a real, industrial regression application, the prediction of paper ""curl"". Confidence estimation performance is assessed by calculating the mean and standard deviation of the prediction interval coverage probability. We show that treating data noise variance as a function of the inputs is appropriate for the curl prediction task. Moreover, we show that the mean coverage probability can only gauge confidence estimation performance as an average over the input space, i.e., global performance and that the standard deviation of the coverage is unreliable as a measure of local performance. The approximate Bayesian approach is found to perform better in terms of global performance.","1941-0093","","10.1109/72.963764","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=963764","","Neural networks;Bayesian methods;Multi-layer neural network;Feedforward neural networks;Multilayer perceptrons;Maximum likelihood estimation;Predictive models;Testing;Industrial control;Probability","feedforward neural nets;multilayer perceptrons;statistical analysis;pattern classification;paper industry;quality control;automatic optical inspection;maximum likelihood estimation;Bayes methods;noise","confidence estimation methods;feedforward neural networks;multilayer perceptrons;regression;classification;maximum likelihood technique;approximate Bayesian technique;bootstrap technique;prediction uncertainty;model parameter misspecification;mean;standard deviation;prediction interval coverage probability;data noise variance;mean coverage probability;approximate Bayesian approach","","97","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

ANNs, when implemented by dedicated hardware application-specific integrated circuit chips, provide extreme simplification and fast execution for control and feedback signal processing functions in high-performance AC drives. In the proposed project, a feedforward ANN-based SVM, operating at 20 kHz sampling frequency, generates symmetrical pulsewidth modulation (PWM) pulses in both undermodulation and overmodulation regions covering the range from DC (zero frequency) up to square-wave mode at 60 Hz. In addition, a programmable cascaded low-pass filter (PCLPF), that permits DC offset-free stator-flux-vector synthesis at very low frequency using the voltage model, has been implemented by a hybrid neural network which consists of a recurrent neural network (RNN) and a feedforward neural network (FFANN). The RNN-FFANN-based flux estimation is simple, permits faster implementation, and gives superior transient performance when compared with a standard digital-signal-processor-based PCLPF. A 5 HP open-loop volts/Hz-controlled drive incorporating the proposed ANN-based SVM and RNN-FFANN-based flux estimator was initially evaluated in the frequency range of 1.0-58 Hz to validate the performance of SVM and the flux estimator. Next, the complete 5 HP drive with stator-flux-oriented vector control was evaluated extensively using the PWM modulator and flux estimator.","1939-9367","","10.1109/28.952506","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=952506","","Stators;Induction motor drives;Pulse width modulation;Support vector machines;Recurrent neural networks;Space vector pulse width modulation;Frequency synthesizers;Frequency estimation;Neural networks;Feedforward neural networks","induction motor drives;machine vector control;stators;magnetic flux;PWM invertors;feedforward neural nets;neurocontrollers;recurrent neural nets;frequency control;voltage control;low-pass filters","stator-flux-oriented vector-controlled induction motor drive;space-vector PWM;flux-vector synthesis;neural networks;space-vector pulsewidth modulation;stator-flux-vector estimation;artificial neural networks;ANN;application-specific integrated circuit chips;feedback signal processing functions;feedforward ANN-based SVM;sampling frequency;symmetrical pulsewidth modulation pulses generation;overmodulation region;undermodulation region;square-wave mode;programmable cascaded low-pass filter;DC offset-free stator-flux-vector synthesis;very low frequency;voltage model;hybrid neural network;recurrent neural network;feedforward neural network;transient performance;digital-signal-processor;frequency control;voltage control;flux estimator;stator-flux-oriented vector control;5 hp;1 to 58 Hz;20 kHz;60 Hz","","48","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since term-by-document matrices are usually high-dimensional and sparse, they are susceptible to noise and are also difficult to capture the underlying semantic structure. Additionally, the storage and processing of such matrices places great demands on computing resources. Dimensionality reduction is a way to overcome these problems. Principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) are popular techniques for dimensionality reduction based on matrix decomposition, however they contain both positive and negative values in the decomposed matrices. In the work described here, we use non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) for dimensionality reduction of the vector space model. Since matrices decomposed by NMF only contain non-negative values, the original data are represented by only additive, not subtractive, combinations of the basis vectors. This characteristic of parts-based representation is appealing because it reflects the intuitive notion of combining parts to form a whole. Also NMF computation is based on the simple iterative algorithm, it is therefore advantageous for applications involving large matrices. Using the MEDLINE collection, we experimentally showed that NMF offers great improvement over the vector space model.","1062-922X","0-7803-7087-2","10.1109/ICSMC.2001.973042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=973042","","Information retrieval;Matrix decomposition;Principal component analysis;Sparse matrices;Information science;Intelligent systems;Systems engineering and theory;Additives;Iterative algorithms;Web sites","information retrieval;matrix decomposition;medical information systems;indexing","vector space model;information retrieval model;document collection;term-by-document matrix;dimensionality reduction;principal component analysis;singular value decomposition;matrix decomposition;nonnegative matrix factorization;additive vector combinations;parts-based representation;iterative algorithm;MEDLINE collection","","18","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Earlier practice in Scandinavia has been to separate operations scheduling and contract management. In the present approach operation scheduling and hedging by future contacts are integrated in one model. The risk level is controlled by setting revenue targets. Revenues below target are penalized; this implicitly defines a revenue utility function to reduce risk. The possibility of dynamically changing the future contract portfolio is now represented. The resulting large stochastic dynamic optimization problem is solved using a combination of stochastic dynamic programming and stochastic dual dynamic programming. Simulations for a test case show that the profit in the lower range is considerably improved with the new tool.

To provide means for system performance advancements and power management, there must be focus on all aspects of the computing platform-architecture, micro-architecture, bus memory, and I/O performance-much more than in the past. Multithreading and multi-core computer micro-architectures will increase both general-purpose and networking processor MIPS. Transaction-focused server processors will benefit from large on-die caches. Special-purpose architectures and circuit techniques will be required to deliver performance with higher efficiency. Future microprocessors will evolve as integration of DSP capabilities becomes imperative to enable such applications as media-rich communications, computer vision, and speech recognition. These advances in processing natural data will lead to a change in the computing paradigm from today's data-based, machine-based computing to tomorrow's knowledge-based, human-based computing. As the Internet becomes more integral to businesses and consumers, there will be new uses for and users of microprocessors. All this can be accomplished only with wired and wireless high-bandwidth Internet connectivity, driven by high-performance computer servers to fulfil the demand of computing in the Internet economy.","0193-6530","0-7803-6608-5","10.1109/ISSCC.2001.912412","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=912412","","Microprocessors;Internet;Memory management;Pressing;Technological innovation;System performance;Energy management;Power system management;Multithreading;Computer networks","low-power electronics;microprocessor chips;computer architecture;multi-threading;cache storage","technology scaling;power issues;microprocessor innovation;system performance;micro-architecture;bus memory;I/O performance;multithreading;multi-core computer;on-die caches;media-rich communications;DSP capabilities;computing paradigm;wireless high-bandwidth Internet connectivity","","71","","4","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Functional, interface, and detailed software FMEAs are described. Initially, the system is described functionally and the component failure modes, which must be functional in a functional system description, are analyzed. Then the interfaces between software modules and between the software and hardware are defined and the interface failure modes are analyzed. Finally, a detailed analysis of the failure modes of individual software variables is done. Doing the analysis in this manner allows the results of the functional analysis to be used to reduce the amount of effort required for the interface and detailed analyses; similarly, the results of the functional and interface analyses reduce the effort required for the detailed analysis. One interesting result is that an analysis of the software includes certain hardware failures such as ""stuck-at"" and memory faults that might not otherwise be analyzed.

"Utilization, predictability, workloads, and user runtime estimates in scheduling the IBM SP2 with backfilling","A. W. Mu'alem; D. G. Feitelson","Sch. of Comput.

Allocating such partitions in the order in which the jobs arrive (FCFS scheduling) is fair and predictable, but suffers from severe fragmentation, leading to low utilization. This situation led to the development of the EASY scheduler which uses aggressive backfilling: Small jobs are moved ahead to fill in holes in the schedule, provided they do not delay the first job in the queue. We compare this approach with a more conservative approach in which small jobs move ahead only if they do not delay any job in the queue and show that the relative performance of the two schemes depends on the workload. For workloads typical on SP2 systems, the aggressive approach is indeed better, but, for other workloads, both algorithms are similar. In addition, we study the sensitivity of backfilling to the accuracy of the runtime estimates provided by the users and find a very surprising result. Backfilling actually works better when users overestimate the runtime by a substantial factor.","1558-2183","","10.1109/71.932708","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=932708","","Runtime;Processor scheduling;Delay;Supercomputers;Measurement;Helium;Dynamic scheduling;Production;Laboratories","processor scheduling;distributed memory systems;performance evaluation","predictability;workloads;user runtime estimates;jobs scheduling;IBM SP2;backfilling;distributed-memory MPPs;EASY scheduler;SP2 systems;sensitivity","","383","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A sensitivity analysis is performed to show that the off-line method is influenced considerably by machine parameter variations. Therefore the concept of forced compensation is introduced and an on-line torque compensation controller is proposed.

These items of equipment draw distorted, and often fluctuating, line current; they also generate high-frequency conducted and radiated noise due to the sharp edges of the waveforms characteristic of the switching power processors employed in them. As a result of the finite grid impedance, the distorted line current increases the distribution losses and causes voltage distortion; also, the fluctuation leads to visible flicker of the emitted light of lamps. The conducted and radiated high-frequency noise interferes with radio and TV reception, communication via cellular telephones, and data transmission. The result is a gradually deteriorating electromagnetic environment.

The vapor-water two-phase flow patterns were observed in the parallel microchannels through a microscope and high-speed video camera. It was observed that hydraulic instabilities occur. Existence of a periodic annular flow was also observed, which consists of a symmetrically distributed liquid ring surrounding the vapor core. Along the microchannel axis, the periodic dry zone appears and develops. The thermal visualization and temperature measurements of the heated device were carried out using infrared thermography. As long as the flow was single phase liquid, the forced convection heat transfer resulted in a moderate irregularity on the heated chip. These temperature differences do not cause damage to a real electronic device. The steady-state heat transfer for different types of microchannels has been studied also at the range of heat flux where phase change of the working fluid from liquid to vapor took place. Under conditions of flow boiling in microchannels, a significant enhancement of heat transfer was established. In the case of uniform heat flux the hydraulic instabilities lead to irregularity of temperature distribution on the heated chip. In the case of nonuniform heat flux the irregularity increased drastically.","1557-9972","","10.1109/6144.910797","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910797","","Temperature distribution;Heat transfer;Microchannel;Infrared heating;Computational modeling;Solid modeling;Computer simulation;Computational geometry;Microscopy;Cameras","thermal management (packaging);microfluidics;heat sinks;temperature distribution;forced convection;boiling;flow instability;channel flow;two-phase flow;flow visualisation;infrared imaging","thermal microsystem;flow in parallel microchannels;electronic device cooling;nonuniform temperature distribution;geometry effect;heat transfer;vapor-water two-phase flow patterns;hydraulic instabilities;periodic annular flow;symmetrically distributed liquid ring;vapor core;periodic dry zone;thermal visualization;infrared thermography;forced convection;thermal irregularity;temperature differences;steady-state transfer;flow boiling;uniform heat flux","","102","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The approach relies on: 1) the calculation of Shannon entropy (SE) of the distribution of patterns lasting three beats; 2) the calculation of a regularity index based on an entropy rate (i.e., the conditional entropy); 3) the classification of frequent deterministic patterns (FDPs) lasting three beats. A redundancy reduction criterion is proposed to group FDPs in four categories according to the number and type or of heart period changes: a) no variation (0V); b) one variation (1V); and c) two like variations (2LV); 4) two unlike variations (2UV). The authors found that: 1) the SE decreased during tilt due to the increased percentage of missing patterns; 2) the regularity index increased during tilt and CR10 as patterns followed each other according to a more repetitive scheme; and 3) during CR10, SE and regularity index were not redundant as the regularity index significantly decreased while SE remained unchanged. Concerning pattern analysis the authors found that: a) at rest mainly three classes (0V, 1V, and 2LV) were detected; b) 0V patterns were more likely during tilt; c) 1V and 2LV patterns were more frequent during CR10; and d) 2UV patterns were more likely during CR20. The proposed approach based on quantification of complexity allows a full characterization of heart period dynamics and the identification of experimental conditions known to differently perturb cardiovascular regulation.","1558-2531","","10.1109/10.959324","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=959324","","Entropy;Pattern classification;Cardiology;Pattern analysis;Laboratories;Heart rate variability;Frequency;Pathology;Performance analysis;Performance evaluation","entropy;pattern classification;electrocardiography","short heart period variability series;complexity;entropy rate;pattern classification;conditional entropy;redundancy reduction criterion;tilt;regularity index;ECG analysis;electrodiagnostics","Analysis of Variance;Biomedical Engineering;Computer Simulation;Entropy;Heart Rate;Humans;Models, Cardiovascular;Pattern Recognition, Automated","227","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This methodology is important to remove the misleadingly large self-heating effect from the DC I-V data in device modeling. Not correcting for SHE may lead to significant error in circuit simulation.

The tracking and erosion resistance of HTV-SIR filled with 0 to 60%wt ATH was evaluated by employing an IEC 587 inclined plane (IP) tracking and erosion test, during which leakage current pulses on HTV-SIR were counted. Surface temperature distributions and the occurrences of thermal spots >400/spl deg/C also were observed by means of an infrared thermovision study. We employed thermogravimetry (TG)-differential thermal analysis (DTA)-mass spectrometer (MS) to observe the thermal degradation of unfilled and filled HTV-SIR in both air and argon. The test results indicate that 40%wt is a critical ATH level and whether tracking and erosion is allowed in the IP tracking and erosion test. Highly filling ATH (>40%wt) reduces the number of low unit silicone oligomer precursors which promote dry-band arcing as well as the presence of residual carbon which leads to carbonization. Chemical modifications of water vapor liberated from heated ATH to methyl groups, which occurs at the thermal decomposition temperature of silicone rubber, were found to result in the above process. The protection mechanisms of ATH for the tracking and erosion of HTV-SIR are formulated herein.","1558-4135","","10.1109/94.919930","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=919930","","Rubber;Testing;IEC standards;Leakage current;Surface resistance;Temperature distribution;Spectroscopy;Thermal degradation;Argon;Filling","insulation testing;surface discharges;wear testing;silicone rubber;filled polymers;vulcanisation;leakage currents;differential thermal analysis;mass spectrometer applications","erosion;HTV silicone rubber;suppression mechanism;ATH;tracking;high temperature vulcanization;IEC 587 inclined plane test;leakage current;surface temperature distributions;thermal spots;infrared thermovision study;thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis;mass spectrometer;silicone oligomer precursors;dry-band arcing;carbonization;thermal decomposition temperature;protection mechanisms","","111","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The second consists of the users of design for environment (DfE) tools and procedures. Typically, these people consist of product designers and design engineers. The authors study these two groups through in-depth interviews with managers and engineers in a sample of ten firms drawn from the ""best-in-class"" environmental leaders.

Two design approaches are presented. In the first method, an optimization program is defined, and the multiplierless transform is obtained by approximating its solution with dyadic values. In the second method, a general lifting-based scaled DCT structure is obtained, and the analytical values of all lifting parameters are derived, enabling dyadic approximations with different accuracies. Therefore, the binDCT can be tuned to cover the gap between the Walsh-Hadamard transform and the DCT. The corresponding two-dimensional (2-D) binDCT allows a 16-bit implementation, enables lossless compression, and maintains satisfactory compatibility with the floating-point DCT.

However, the Reflex/sup TM/ method generally uses a current limiting resistor, which causes loss of energy and makes the charger bulky. The paper presents a novel circuit topology for Reflex/sup TM/ method. This circuit topology is composed of a two-stage converter, in which the first stage is a half-bridge converter providing a voltage source and the second stage is a bi-directional buck-boost converter. During the positive pulse charging mode operations, the buck converter supplies energy to charge the battery. During the negative pulse discharging mode operations, the boost converter transfers the energy released by the battery to a capacitor, avoiding the consumption of it.

An abstract semantic model has two requirements: it should be rich enough to provide a friendly interface of multimedia presentation synchronization schedules to the users and it should be a good programming data structure for implementation in order to control multimedia playback. An abstract semantic model based on an augmented transition network (ATN) is presented. The inputs for ATNs are modeled by multimedia input strings. Multimedia input strings provide an efficient means for iconic indexing of the temporal/spatial relations of media streams and semantic objects. An ATN and its subnetworks are used to represent the appearing sequence of media streams and semantic objects. The arc label is a substring of a multimedia input string. In this design, a presentation is driven by a multimedia input string. Each subnetwork has its own multimedia input string. Database queries relative to text, image, and video can be answered via substring matching at subnetworks. Multimedia browsing allows users the flexibility to select any part of the presentation they prefer to see. This means that the ATN and its subnetworks can be included in multimedia database systems which are controlled by a database management system (DBMS). User interactions and loops are also provided in an ATN. Therefore, ATNs provide three major capabilities: multimedia presentations, temporal/spatial multimedia database searching, and multimedia browsing.","1558-2191","","10.1109/69.940735","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=940735","","Multimedia databases;Multimedia systems;Information systems;Streaming media;Control systems;Data structures;Indexing;Image databases;Database systems;Animation","multimedia databases;synchronisation;video databases;temporal databases;string matching;database indexing","spatio-temporal semantic model;multimedia database systems;multimedia information systems;information sources;abstract semantic models;video data;audio data;text data;image data;interface;multimedia presentation synchronization schedules;programming data structure;multimedia playback;augmented transition network;multimedia input strings;iconic indexing;temporal relations;spatial relations;media streams;semantic objects;arc label;database queries;substring matching;subnetworks;multimedia browsing;database management system;user interactions;loops;multimedia presentations;temporal multimedia database searching;spatial multimedia database searching","","19","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the first case, the three-phase system is decomposed in orthogonal odq components. A complex vector model is then built from the dq and o components. In the second case, a complex vector model is introduced by decomposing the system in three single-phase systems. In both cases, an orthogonal, fictitious circuit is introduced to handle a single-phase system, such as the homopolar system or each one of the three single-phase systems that compose a three-phase four-wire system.

The GUPFC should have stronger control capability than the UPFC. A mathematical model for the GUPFC consisting of one shunt converter and two or more series converters is developed and implemented in a nonlinear interior point OPF algorithm.

Automated substations consist of microprocessor-based relays, circuit breakers, transformers, and motor-operated air switches that are monitored by a graphical interface unit that can be remotely accessed.

Syst & Concepts, USA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","","2001","37","1","22","39","In this paper we describe a novel data association algorithm, termed m-best S-D, that determines in O(mSkn/sup 3/) time (m assignments, S/spl ges/3 lists of size n, k relaxations) the (approximately) m-best solutions to an S-D assignment problem. The m-best S-D algorithm is applicable to tracking problems where either the sensors are synchronized or the sensors and/or the targets are very slow moving. The significance of this work is that the m-best S-D assignment algorithm (in a sliding window mode) can provide for an efficient implementation of a suboptimal multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) algorithm by obviating the need for a brute force enumeration of an exponential number of joint hypotheses. We first describe the general problem for which the m-best S-D applies. Specifically, given line of sight (LOS) (i.e., incomplete position) measurements from S sensors, sets of complete position measurements are extracted, namely, the 1st, 2nd, ..., mth best (in terms of likelihood) sets of composite measurements are determined by solving a static S-D assignment problem. Utilizing the joint likelihood functions used to determine the m best S-D assignment solutions, the composite measurements are then quantified with a probability of being correct using a JPDA-like (joint probabilistic data association) technique. Lists of composite measurements from successive scans, along with their corresponding probabilities, are used in turn with a state estimator in a dynamic 2-D assignment algorithm to estimate the states of moving targets over time. The dynamic assignment cost coefficients are based on a likelihood function that incorporates the ""true"" composite measurement probabilities obtained from the (static) m-best S-D assignment solutions. We demonstrate the merits of the m-best S-D algorithm by applying it to a simulated multitarget passive sensor track formation and maintenance problem, consisting of multiple time samples of LOS measurements originating from multiple (S=7) synchronized high frequency direction finding sensors.","1557-9603","","10.1109/7.913665","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=913665","","Target tracking;Position measurement;State estimation;Frequency synchronization;Time measurement;Multidimensional systems;Force sensors;Heuristic algorithms;Cost function;Modeling","target tracking;sensor fusion;parallel algorithms;covariance matrices;computational complexity;Kalman filters;tracking filters;direction-of-arrival estimation;state estimation;maximum likelihood estimation","data association algorithm;m-best S-D assignment algorithm;multitarget tracking;synchronized sensors;very slow moving targets;sliding window mode;suboptimal multiple hypothesis tracking algorithm;LOS measurements;complete position measurements;likelihood sets;joint likelihood functions;joint probabilistic data association;state estimator;dynamic 2-D assignment algorithm;dynamic assignment cost coefficients;composite measurement probabilities;multitarget passive sensor track formation;multiple time samples;high frequency direction finding sensors;Kalman filter;computational complexity;algorithm parallelization;covariance derivation","","80","","47","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Outlined in this report is our collective progress in developing the underlying science and technology that will enable the functions of specific brain damaged regions to be replaced by multichip modules consisting of novel hybrid analog/digital microchips. The component microchips are ""neurocomputational"" incorporating experimentally based mathematical models of the nonlinear dynamic and adaptive properties of biological neurons and neural networks. The hardware developed to date, although limited in capacity, can perform computations supporting cognitive functions such as pattern recognition, but more generally will support any brain function for which there is sufficient experimental information. To allow the ""neurocomputational"" multichip module to communicate with existing brain tissue, another novel microcircuitry element has been developed-silicon-based multielectrode arrays that are ""neuromorphic,"" i.e., designed to conform to the region-specific cytoarchitecture of the brain, When the ""neurocomputational"" and ""neuromorphic"" components are fully integrated, our vision is that the resulting prosthetic, after intracranial implantation, will receive electrical impulses from targeted subregions of the the brain, process the information using the hardware model of that brain region, and communicate back to the functioning brain.

Terrestrially, the need for line-of-sight propagation paths represents a constraint unless very large numbers of base-station masts are deployed, while satellite systems have capacity limitations. An emerging solution is offered by high-altitude platforms (HAPs) operating in the stratosphere at altitudes of up to 22 km to provide communication facilities that can exploit the best features of both terrestrial and satellite schemes. This paper outlines the application and features of HAPs, and some specific development programmes.

To combat the negative effects of occlusion and articulated motion we use a multiview implementation, where each view is first independently processed on a dedicated processor. This monocular processing uses a predictor-corrector filter to weigh reprojections of three-dimensional (3-D) position estimates, obtained by the central processor, against observations of measurable image motion. The corrected state vectors from each view provide input observations to a Bayesian belief network, in the central processor, with a dynamic, multidimensional topology that varies as a function of scene content and feature confidence. The Bayesian net fuses independent observations from multiple cameras by iteratively resolving independency relationships and confidence levels within the graph, thereby producing the most likely vector of 3-D state estimates given the available data. To maintain temporal continuity, we follow the network with a layer of Kalman filtering that updates the 3-D state estimates. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system using a multiview sequence of several people in motion. Our experiments suggest that, when compared with data fusion based on averaging, the proposed technique yields a noticeable improvement in tracking accuracy.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.959340","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=959340","","Cameras;Tracking;Humans;Bayesian methods;State estimation;Distributed computing;Filters;Motion estimation;Motion measurement;Position measurement","distributed tracking;real-time systems;surveillance;image motion analysis;filtering theory;prediction theory;belief networks;state estimation;Kalman filters;image sequences;sensor fusion;distributed processing","multiple camera tracking;distributed real-time computing platform;multiple interacting persons;articulated motion;multiview implementation;dedicated processor;monocular processing;predictor-corrector filter;multiple camera fusion;3D position estimates;central processor;image motion;state vectors;input observations;Bayesian belief network;dynamic multidimensional topology;scene content;feature confidence;independency relationships;confidence levels;real-time tracking;graph;3D state estimates;Kalman filtering;multiview sequence;tracking accuracy;occluded human motion;interacting human motion","","148","","53","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Various probabilistic techniques of intrusion detection, including decision tree, Hotelling's T/sup 2/ test, chi-square multivariate test, and Markov chain are applied to the same training set and the same testing set of computer audit data for investigating the frequency property and the ordering property of computer audit data. The results of these studies provide answers to several questions concerning which properties are critical to intrusion detection. First, our studies show that the frequency property of multiple audit event types in a sequence of events is necessary for intrusion detection. A single audit event at a given time is not sufficient for intrusion detection. Second, the ordering property of multiple audit events provides additional advantage to the frequency property for intrusion detection. However, unless the scalability problem of complex data models taking into account the ordering property of activity data is solved, intrusion detection techniques based on the frequency property provide a viable solution that produces good intrusion detection performance with low computational overhead.","1558-2426","","10.1109/3468.935043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=935043","","Intrusion detection;Information systems;Testing;Frequency;Pattern recognition;Laboratories;Decision trees;Computer bugs;Telecommunication traffic;Pattern matching","auditing;probability;security of data;decision trees;Markov processes;information systems","probabilistic techniques;intrusion detection;computer audit data;activity data;information system;decision tree;Hotelling T/sup 2/ test;chi-square multivariate test;Markov chain;multiple audit event types;event sequence;complex data models;frequency property;low computational overhead","","123","","57","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For low to medium time delay problems, a new PID tuning scheme is then developed. The proposed tuning rule is capable of accommodating the actuator's saturation and therefore has the ability to select an optimum PID controller. By using a separate time response analysis, a new PI tuning scheme for large normalised time delay is then derived. Numerical studies are made for higher-order processes having monotonic open-loop characteristics. The performance is compared with other commonly available tuning rules.

"An ordinal optimization based bidding strategy for electric power suppliers in the daily energy market","Xiaohong Guan; Yu-Chi Ho; Fei Lai","Div. of Eng. & Appl.

Traditional unit commitment or hydrothermal scheduling problems have been integrated with generation resource bidding, but the development of optimization based bidding strategies is only at a very preliminary stage. This paper presents a bidding strategy based on the theory of ordinal optimization that the ordinal comparisons of performance measures are robust with respect to noise and modeling error, and the problems become much easier if the optimization goal is softened from asking for the ""best"""" to ""good enough"" solution. The basic idea is to use an approximate model that describes the influence of bidding strategies on the market clearing prices (MCP). A nominal bid curve is obtained by solving optimal power generation for a given set of MCPs via Lagrangian relaxation. Then N bids are generated by perturbing the nominal bid curve. The ordinal optimization method is applied to isolate a good enough set S that contains some good bids with high probability by performing rough evaluation. The best bid is then selected by solving full hydrothermal scheduling or unit commitment problems for each of the bids in S. Using ordinal optimization approach we are able to obtain a good enough bidding strategy with reasonable computational effort. Numerical results using historical MCPs from the California market and a generation company with 10 units show that the ordinal optimization based method is efficient.","1558-0679","","10.1109/59.962428","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=962428","","Power generation economics;Power system reliability;Job shop scheduling;Optimization methods;Industrial economics;Power system economics;Noise measurement;Noise robustness;Power generation;Lagrangian functions","electricity supply industry;optimisation;power generation scheduling;hydrothermal power systems;relaxation;power system economics","ordinal optimization based bidding strategy;electric power suppliers;daily energy market;power industry deregulation;reliable operation;economic operation;unit commitment;hydrothermal scheduling;generation resource bidding;noise;modeling error;market clearing prices;nominal bid curve;optimal power generation;Lagrangian relaxation;high probability;rough evaluation;California market;generation company","","86","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The technique is applied to a brushless DC traction machine, in which the rotor loss is due predominantly to time harmonics in the stator armature reaction field which resulted from commutation events, and loss predictions are compared with thermometric-based measurements.

The complex signal is built from a real signal by adding its Hilbert transform-which is a phase-shifted version of the signal-as an imaginary part to the signal. Since its introduction, the complex signal has become an important tool in signal processing, with applications, for example, in narrowband communication. Different approaches to an n-D analytic or complex signal have been proposed in the past. We review these approaches and propose the hypercomplex signal as a novel extension of the complex signal to n-D. This extension leads to a new definition of local phase, which reveals information on the intrinsic dimensionality of the signal. The different approaches are unified by expressing all of them as combinations of the signal and its partial and total Hilbert transforms. Examples that clarify how the approaches differ in their definitions of local phase and amplitude are shown. An example is provided for the two-dimensional (2-D) hypercomplex signal, which shows how the novel phase concept can be used in texture segmentation.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.960432","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=960432","","Signal analysis;Multidimensional systems;Computer aided software engineering;Signal processing;Fourier transforms;Multidimensional signal processing;Narrowband;Frequency;Gabor filters;Image processing","multidimensional signal processing;image texture;image segmentation;Hilbert transforms","analytic signal;multidimensional signal;2D hypercomplex signals;Gabor's complex signal;real 1D signal local phase;real 1D signal local amplitude;Hilbert transform;signal processing;narrowband communication;complex signal;partial Hilbert transform;total Hilbert transform;texture segmentation","","221","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Also, when ISI channels have many taps, the data rate overhead due to the insertion of the cyclic prefix is high. We first propose a precoded OFDM system that may improve the performance of the OFDM systems for spectral null channels. We also propose size K/spl times/x1 vector OFDM (VOFDM) systems that reduce the cyclic prefix length by K times compared to the conventional OFDM systems. The precoding scheme is simply to insert one or more zeros between each two sets of K consecutive information symbols, although it can be generalized to a general form. This precoding scheme may be able to remove the spectral nulls of an ISI channel without knowing the ISI channel. When no zero is inserted between each two sets of K consecutive information symbols and only each K consecutive symbols are blocked together, we obtain VOFDM systems.

They are fundamental to the operation of filters and oscillators, and the performance of these circuits is primarily limited by the resonator quality factor. At microwave frequencies, the quality factor (Q) of metal transmission line resonant circuits is proportional to volume. As a result, waveguide structures are often employed to increase Q at the expense of size, weight, and cost. Dielectric resonators overcome these limitations due to the fact that their losses are dominated by dielectric loss (loss tangent), and only in small part to metallic losses (housing). Dielectric losses are improving constantly, whereas metal losses, with the exception of superconductors, have remained substantially the same. These resonators can be made to perform the same functions as waveguide filters, but are, in contrast, very small, stable and lightweight.

In this paper, for the first time, we present methodologies for uniaxial tensile and cantilever bending testing of both micrometer- and submicrometer-scale freestanding specimens using MEMS actuators. We also introduce dry fabrication processes for the specimens. The methodologies allow freestanding single or multilayered thin-film specimens to be fabricated separately from the MEMS actuators. For the uniaxial tension test, tensile forces are applied by lateral comb drive actuators capable of generating a total load of 383 /spl mu/N at 40 V with resolutions on the order of 3 nN. A similar actuator is used in the bending test, with load resolution of 58 nN and spring constant of 0.78 N/m. The tensile testing methodology is demonstrated with the testing of a 110-nm-thick freestanding aluminum specimen. The cantilever bending experiment is performed on a 100-nm-thick aluminum specimen. The experimental setups can be mounted in a SEM (and also in a TEM after modifications for tensile testing) for in situ observation of materials behavior under different environmental conditions. Remarkable strengthening is observed in all the specimens tested compared to their bulk counterparts in both tensile and bending experiments. Experimental results highlight the potential of MEMS actuators as a new tool for materials research.","1941-0158","","10.1109/84.911103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=911103","","Materials testing;Micromechanical devices;Actuators;Transistors;Aluminum;Substrates;Material properties;Polymer films;Fabrication;Force measurement","microactuators;tensile testing;bending;scanning electron microscopy;transmission electron microscopy;environmental testing","microscale materials testing;MEMS actuators;displacement measurements;force measurements;micromechanical testing;uniaxial tensile testing;cantilever bending testing;freestanding specimens;dry fabrication processes;lateral comb drive actuators;load resolution;spring constant;SEM;TEM;environmental conditions;40 V;110 nm;100 nm;Al","","89","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

ICSM 2001","","2001","","","663","666","Evolution of a software system is a natural process. In many systems evolution occurs during the working phase of their lifecycles. Such systems need to be designed to evolve, i.e., adaptable. Semantically adaptable systems are of particular interest to industry as such systems adapt themselves to environmental change with little or no intervention from their developers. Research in embedded systems is now becoming widespread but developing semantically adaptable embedded systems presents challenges of its own. Embedded systems usually have a restricted hardware configuration, hence techniques developed for other types of systems cannot be directly applied to embedded systems. This paper briefly presents the work done in semantic adaptation of embedded systems, using remotely controlled embedded systems as an application. In this domain, an embedded system is connected to an external controller via a communication link such as ethernet, serial, radio frequency, etc., and receives commands from, and sends responses to, the external controller. Techniques for semantic evolution in this application domain give a glimpse of the complexity involved in tackling the problem of semantic evolution in embedded systems. The techniques developed in this paper were validated by applying them in a real embedded system - a test instrument used for testing cell phones.","1063-6773","0-7695-1189-9","10.1109/ICSM.2001.972784","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=972784","","Embedded system;Communication system control;Control systems;Radio control;System testing;Software systems;Hardware;Ethernet networks;Radio frequency;Instruments","embedded systems;software maintenance;software architecture","systems evolution;lifecycles;embedded systems;software system evolution;maintenance;semantic evolution","","8","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A peak in the coercivity was observed for small amounts of boron. Measurements of coercivity with fields applied along the radial and circumferential directions of the Si wafer showed isotropic magnetic behavior. The coercivity and saturation induction decreased with increasing amounts of boron above 2 at.%. High angle X-ray diffraction showed a broadening of the [110] peak with increasing boron, indicative of either increased microstrains or smaller average grain size perpendicular to the film. The [110] peak, however, did not shift with added boron, suggesting that on average the boron does not expand the FeCo lattice. The drop in coercivity around 10 at.% B was identified with a transition to a primarily amorphous state. Since these alloys have a high positive magnetostriction, their magnetic properties are particularly sensitive to film stress/strain.

Shows that RBB becomes less effective for leakage reduction at shorter channel lengths and lower V/sub t/ at both high and room temperatures, especially when target intrinsic leakage currents are high. RBB effectiveness also diminishes with technology scaling primarily because of worsening short-channel effects (SCE), particularly when target V/sub t/ values are low. A model is given that relates different transistor leakage components to full-chip leakage current, and is validated through test-chip measurements across a range of RBB values.","","1-58113-371-5","10.1109/LPE.2001.945402","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=945402","","Leakage current;Current measurement;Subthreshold current;Microprocessors;Temperature dependence;Logic devices;Semiconductor device measurement;Permission;Circuit testing;CMOS process","leakage currents;CMOS logic circuits;integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit modelling;integrated circuit measurement","reverse body bias;leakage control;scaled dual Vt CMOS;leakage power;active operation;burn-in;standby;logic process technologies;channel length;temperature;leakage reduction;intrinsic leakage currents;RBB effectiveness;technology scaling;short-channel effects;model;full-chip leakage current;test-chip measurements;0.18 micron;0.13 micron","","55","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to evaluate organizational performance for each policy, a simulation was constructed to ascertain the optimal distribution of influence for managers under different work parameters and for various organizational objectives. The simulation provided answers for when organizational and market conditions necessitate increases or reductions in the influence of project managers in order to reach optimum performance. Based on the organizational objectives selected for this study, different patterns were found to characterize decision-making. Patterns varied considerably. At one extreme, the distribution of influence for reaching a specific objective remained stable despite changes in work parameters.

Compared to other mechatronic design methodologies, DFC emphasizes obtaining a simple dynamic model of the mechanical structure by a judicious structure design and a careful selection of mechanical parameters. Once the simple dynamic model is available, in spite of the complexity of the mechanical structure, the controller design can be facilitated and better control performance can be achieved.

Motivated by the dime antenna another novel miniature antenna geometry, called qdime, was studied in detail. Mutual coupling analysis between qdime antenna pairs with respect to orientation is investigated to determine optimum multielement antenna configuration (less mutual coupling and less space occupation) for use in diversity systems that require sufficiently decorrelated received signals at each antenna element.

The approximate model is verified by experimental measurements. We view the evolution of these density functions through an iterative decoder as a nonlinear dynamical system with feedback. Iterative decoding of turbo codes and of serially concatenated codes is analyzed by examining whether a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the extrinsic information keeps growing with iterations. We define a ""noise figure"" for the iterative decoder, such that the turbo decoder will converge to the correct codeword if the noise figure is bounded by a number below zero dB. By decomposing the code's noise figure into individual curves of output SNR versus input SNR corresponding to the individual constituent codes, we gain many new insights into the performance of the iterative decoder for different constituents. Many mysteries of turbo codes are explained based on this analysis. For example, we show why certain codes converge better with iterative decoding than more powerful codes which are only suitable for maximum likelihood decoding. The roles of systematic bits and of recursive convolutional codes as constituents of turbo codes are crystallized. The analysis is generalized to serial concatenations of mixtures of complementary outer and inner constituent codes. Design examples are given to optimize mixture codes to achieve low iterative decoding thresholds on the signal-to-noise ratio of the channel.","1558-0008","","10.1109/49.924873","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=924873","","Iterative decoding;Maximum likelihood decoding;Signal to noise ratio;Turbo codes;Density functional theory;Noise figure;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Feedback;Concatenated codes;Information analysis","iterative decoding;turbo codes;concatenated codes;Gaussian processes;approximation theory;feedback;noise;convolutional codes","iterative turbo decoder analysis;density evolution;symmetric Gaussian density functions;approximate model;nonlinear dynamical system;feedback;serial concatenated codes;signal-to-noise ratio;noise figure;codeword;output SNR;input SNR;performance;turbo codes;convergence;iterative decoding;maximum likelihood decoding;systematic bits;recursive convolutional codes;outer constituent codes;inner constituent code;code design;mixture codes;iterative decoding thresholds","","202","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, it may be useful to look at the possibility of combining both functions into one system. This paper considers a flywheel energy storage system which performs both functions and presents a novel control scheme using both sinusoidal pulse width modulation as well as a boost converter to regulate the critical load voltage on the feeder. Dynamic voltage compensation is achieved by injecting voltage through series transformers rather than by connecting the system in shunt, to minimize the amount of kVA required by the flywheel system.

The process of collecting data may be viewed as mapping from the object space to an image space. Since most GPRs use broad beam width antennas, the energy reflected from a buried structure is recorded over a large lateral aperture in the image spare, migration algorithms are used to reconstruct an accurate scattering map by refocusing the recorded scattering events to their true spatial locations through a backpropagation process. The goal of this paper is to present a pair of finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) reverse-time migration algorithms for GPR data processing. Linear inverse scattering theory is used to develop a matched-filter response for the GPR problem. The reverse-time migration algorithms, developed for both bistatic and monostatic antenna configurations, are implemented via FDTD in the object space.

An incorrect assumption on the value of the activation energy can lead to an incorrect deduction regarding the effect that the covariate has on the product, as well as an erroneous calculation of the acceleration factor. Estimating the activation energy based on the accelerated-test data removes all of the guesswork when it comes time to decide on a value. The idea of estimating the activation energy based on data is not exactly a new idea, but now this process can be conducted more easily. In the past, the process was long and tedious and involved a lot of iterative calculations. But now, the ability to estimate the activation energy based on collected accelerated-test data has been implemented within a software package, ALTA/sup TM/, which is expressly designed for accelerated life testing analysis. The activation energy can be determined by simply making it one of the unknown parameters that need to be estimated. In doing so, the problems which arise from selecting an activation energy have been removed, and the data alone dictates the value. To illustrate this, accelerated life test data was collected on thermally stressed hard drive systems and analyzed using the Arrhenius-Weibull model. The parameters of the Arrhenius model are then estimated using maximum likelihood theory. Once the parameters of the life-stress relationship are obtained, the activation energy can then be easily estimated, along with the acceleration factor.","0149-144X","0-7803-6615-8","10.1109/RAMS.2001.902442","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=902442","","Acceleration;Life estimation;Life testing;Stress;Temperature distribution;Kelvin;Maximum likelihood estimation;Probability density function;Sun;Humidity","life testing;maximum likelihood estimation;iterative methods;hard discs;disc drives;thermal stresses;failure analysis","activation energy determination;activation energy interpretation;accelerated-test data;product life;incorrect deduction;acceleration factor;iterative calculations;ALTA software package;thermally stressed hard drive systems;Arrhenius-Weibull model;maximum likelihood theory;life-stress relationship;failure mechanisms","","9","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As such, while the accuracy of land cover target identification has been improved using fuzzy classification, it remains for robust techniques that provide better spatial representation of land cover to be developed. Such techniques could provide more accurate land cover metrics for determining social or environmental policy, for example. The use of a Hopfield neural network to map the spatial distribution of classes more reliably using prior information of pixel composition determined from fuzzy classification was investigated. An approach was adopted that used the output from a fuzzy classification to constrain a Hopfield neural network formulated as an energy minimization tool. The network converges to a minimum of an energy function, defined as a goal and several constraints. Extracting the spatial distribution of target class components within each pixel was, therefore, formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem with an optimal solution determined by the minimum of the energy function. This energy minimum represents a ""best guess"" map of the spatial distribution of class components in each pixel. The technique was applied to both synthetic and simulated Landsat TM imagery, and the resultant maps provided an accurate and improved representation of the land covers studied, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) for Landsat imagery of the order of 0.09 pixels in the new fine resolution image recorded.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.917895","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=917895","","Image resolution;Hopfield neural networks;Remote sensing;Spatial resolution;Pixel;Satellites;Image sensors;Remote monitoring;Robustness;Fuzzy neural networks","geophysical techniques;geophysical signal processing;remote sensing;terrain mapping;image classification;geophysics computing;Hopfield neural nets","geophysical measurement technique;land surface;terrain mapping;image processing;remote sensing;neural net;super-resolution target identification;image resolution;Hopfield neural network;land cover;Hopfield neural net;spatial distribution;image classification;energy minimization tool","","218","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We first point out that the information on the rate bounds can be exploited by considering an augmented system described by an implicit model. We then develop a tool, called the quadratic separator, for stability analysis of uncertain implicit systems. Using this tool, a sufficient stability condition is obtained for the original linear parameter-varying system. Moreover, we show that the stability condition obtained is equivalent to the existence of a Lyapunov function that depends on the parameters in a linear fractional manner.

Although initial application of Bluetooth technology has been focused mainly on replacing cables between hand-held devices, general wireless telecommunication such as public Internet access via a Bluetooth-equipped device is expected to be one of the most popular applications in the near future. However, it is not well understood whether the performance of Bluetooth-based systems is sufficient for such an application. We present preliminary results of performance evaluation of a Bluetooth-based Internet access point. The evaluation is based on simulation of an Internet access model consisting of a Bluetooth-based network access point and a number of Bluetooth-equipped notebook computers. The simulation results indicate that Bluetooth provides performance comparable to the fastest dial-up modem even when a number of users share a single Bluetooth radio unit. Better performance is expected when more than one Bluetooth radio unit are employed such that each unit services different users concurrently. However, Bluetooth units in a single radio range (about 10 m) interferes with each other since the channels established by each unit occasionally collide at the same frequency band. This paper analyzes the impact of such interference based on an analytical model of inter-channel interference. The analysis shows that the performance improves as the number of channels increases up to 40.

"Conceptualizing trust: a typology and e-commerce customer relationships model","D. H. McKnight; N. L. Chervany","Coll. of Bus., Florida State Univ., Tallahassee, FL, USA; NA","Proceedings of the 34th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","","2001","","","10 pp.","","A typology of trust concepts would enable researchers to compare results and communicate results more clearly. The typology would be especially valuable if the types of trust are shown to relate to each other. This paper justifies such an interdisciplinary typology and relates the trust constructs to e-commerce actions. It defines both conceptual level and operational level trust constructs. The conceptual level constructs consist of disposition to trust (from psychology), institution-based trust (from sociology), and trusting beliefs and trusting intentions (from social psychology). Each construct is further decomposed into two to four measurable subconstructs. Web vendor interventions designed to encourage customers to purchase goods/services or to share personal information with the vendor are posited to affect these behaviors by influencing customer trusting beliefs and trusting intentions in the vendor.","","0-7695-0981-9","10.1109/HICSS.2001.927053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=927053","","Psychology;Electronic commerce;Educational institutions;Business communication;Sociology;Uncertainty;Internet;Lenses;Economic forecasting;Dictionaries","electronic commerce;Internet;information resources;psychology;human factors","trust conceptualization;e-commerce;customer relationship model;typology;psychology;disposition to trust;institution-based trust;sociology;trusting beliefs;trusting intentions;social psychology;Web vendor;personal information;Internet","","28","","67","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For best performance in image compression, wavelet transforms require filters that combine a number of desirable properties, such as orthogonality and symmetry. However, the design possibilities for wavelets are limited because they cannot simultaneously possess all of the desirable properties. The relatively new field of multiwavelets shows promise in obviating some of the limitations of wavelets. Multiwavelets offer more design options and are able to combine several desirable transform features. The few previously published results of multiwavelet-based image compression have mostly fallen short of the performance enjoyed by the current wavelet algorithms. This paper presents new multiwavelet transform and quantization methods and introduces multiwavelet packets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our techniques exhibit performance equal to, or in several cases superior to, the current wavelet filters.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.913585","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=913585","","Image coding;Wavelet packets;Wavelet transforms;Quantization;Filters;Image quality;Transform coding;Image reconstruction;Testing","image coding;data compression;wavelet transforms;transform coding","image compression techniques;multiwavelets;multiwavelet packets;wavelet transforms;quantization methods;wavelet filters","","106","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The technique is based on the observation that the extrinsic information from constituent maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoders is well approximated by Gaussian random variables when the inputs to the decoders are Gaussian. The independent Gaussian model implies the existence of an iterative decoder threshold that statistically characterizes the convergence of the iterative decoder. Specifically, the iterative decoder converges to zero probability of error as the number of iterations increases if and only if the channel E/sub b//N/sub 0/ exceeds the threshold. Despite the idealization of the model and the simplicity of the analysis technique, the predicted threshold values are in excellent agreement with the waterfall regions observed experimentally in the literature when the codeword lengths are large. Examples are given for parallel concatenated convolutional codes, serially concatenated convolutional codes, and the generalized low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes of Gallager and Cheng-McEliece (1996).

Vector control of the five-phase induction motor generates the fundamental and third harmonic currents. In conjunction with the designed five-phase induction motor geometry, this current profile induces the nearly rectangular flux linkage in the air-gap resulting in higher power density and more output torque. The direct torque control method is advantageous when applied to the five-phase induction motor. The five-phase inverter provides 32 space voltage vectors in comparison to 8 space voltage vectors by the three-phase inverter. Therefore, a more elaborate flux and torque control algorithm for the five-phase induction motor can be employed. Direct torque control of the five-phase induction motor minimizes the ripples of the stator flux and the torque, and achieves a more precise flux and torque control. A 32-bit floating-point TMS320C32 Digital Signal Processor (DSP) enables these two sophisticated control techniques to be conveniently implemented with a high control precision. Experimental results show that an ideal control performance is obtained for both control methods as applied to the five-phase induction motor, and further validate theoretical analysis and simulation results.","","0-7803-7091-0","10.1109/IEMDC.2001.939316","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=939316","","Induction motor drives;Control systems;Torque control;Induction motors;Inverters;Voltage;Machine vector control;Induction generators;Geometry;Couplings","induction motor drives;machine vector control;torque control;digital control;digital signal processing chips;magnetic flux;magnetic variables control;invertors;stators;air gaps","five-phase induction motor drives;DSP-based control system;vector control;direct torque control;digital implementation;third harmonic current;fundamental harmonic current;five-phase induction motor geometry;nearly rectangular flux linkage;air-gap;higher power density;output torque;direct torque control method;five-phase inverter;space voltage vectors;three-phase inverter;torque control algorithm;flux control algorithm;stator flux ripples minimisation;32-bit floating-point TMS320C32 Digital Signal Processor;ideal control performance","","4","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We perform tracking not on the basis of the standard measurements but on the raw radar video data. Detection then is based upon the a posteriori information, i.e., the probability density of the state given these past measurements (in this case video data). This way of data processing/tracking is also referred to as track before detect (TBD) for obvious reasons. An advantage of this method over classical tracking is that in this TBD approach the decision whether a target is present or not is based on integrated and kinematically correlated energy. This method is better suited for tracking weak targets in noise than the classical method. As this problem statement leads to a nonlinear non-Gaussian filtering problem classical filtering methods (e.g. Kalman filtering) will result in poor performance. A particle filter is used to deal with the nonlinearities and the non-Gaussian nature of the noise.

It deploys techniques based on machine learning alongside more conventional methods. These techniques can generate decision or prediction models based on actual historical data. Therefore, they represent true evidence-based decision support. Rainfall prediction is a good problem to solve by data mining techniques. This paper proposes an improved naive Bayes classifier (INCB) technique and explores the use of genetic algorithms (GAs) for the selection of a subset of input features in classification problems. It then carries out a comparison with several other techniques. It compares the following algorithms on real meteorological data in Hong Kong: (1) genetic algorithms with average classification or general classification (GA-AC and GA-C), (2) C4.5 with pruning, and (3) INBC with relative frequency or initial probability density (INBC-RF and INBC-IPD). Two simple schemes are proposed to construct a suitable data set for improving their performance. Scheme I uses all the basic input parameters for rainfall prediction. Scheme II uses the optimal subset of input variables which are selected by a GA. The results show that, among the methods we compared, INBC achieved about a 90% accuracy rate on the rain/no-rain classification problems. This method also attained reasonable performance on rainfall prediction with three-level depth and five-level depth, which are around 65%-70%.","1558-2442","","10.1109/5326.941848","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=941848","","Bayesian methods;Data mining;Genetic algorithms;Databases;Machine learning;Predictive models;Meteorology;Frequency;Input variables;Rain","Bayes methods;pattern classification;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);rain;weather forecasting;forecasting theory;genetic algorithms;probability;geophysics computing;very large databases;temporal databases;software performance evaluation","improved naive Bayesian classifier;input solution method;data mining;underlying pattern determination;optimal decisions;large database;constantly changing data;machine learning;decision models;prediction models;historical data;evidence-based decision support;rainfall prediction;genetic algorithms;input feature subset selection;meteorological data;Hong Kong;average classification;general classification;C4.5;pruning;relative frequency;initial probability density;algorithm performance;input parameters;optimal input variables subset;accuracy;3-level depth;5-level depth","","26","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Three digital bearing estimators are developed as candidates to replace the analog signal processing portion of the ABM. Using the same antenna array, they perform all signal processing in the frequency domain, thereby benefitting from the computational efficiency of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. The first estimator requires two analog-to-digital converters (A-D) and three antenna elements. It multiplies the difference between the discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs) of the output signals from two antenna elements with that from a third antenna element. At each frequency component, the phase of this product is a function of the bearing. A weighted least squares (LS) fit through all the phase components then gives a bearing estimate. The second estimator is similar to the first but uses three A-D and all four antenna elements. The output signal from the additional antenna element provides an independent estimate of the weights for the LS fit, giving an improvement in accuracy. The third estimator applies the physical constraint existing between the time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) of a signal intercepted by two perpendicular sets of antenna elements. This yields a better estimator than simple averaging of the bearing from each set of antenna elements. The simulation studies used sinusoids and broadband signals to corroborate the theoretical treatment and demonstrate the accuracy achievable with these estimators. All three direction finders have superior performance in comparison with the analog ABM.","1557-9603","","10.1109/7.976956","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=976956","","Directive antennas;Signal processing algorithms;Antenna arrays;Array signal processing;Antenna accessories;Bandwidth;Digital signal processing;Frequency domain analysis;Computational efficiency;Fast Fourier transforms","direction-of-arrival estimation;electronic warfare;antenna arrays;array signal processing;discrete Fourier transforms","antenna array direction finder;systemic errors;component matching problems;bandwidth limitations;digital bearing estimators;frequency domain;computational efficiency;analog-to-digital;discrete Fourier transforms;weighted least squares fit;time-difference-of-arrival;four-element Adcock-Butler matrix antenna array;electronic warfare systems","","13","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The optimal generalization is achieved when the number of hidden units of a RBF predictor approaches infinity. When noise exists, it is shown that an optimal RBF predictor should use a finite number of hidden units. To determine the structure of an optimal RBF predictor, we propose a new technique called the cross-validated subspace method to estimate the optimum number of hidden units. While the subspace technique is used to identify a suitable number of hidden units by detecting the dimension of the subspace spanned by the signal eigenvectors, the cross validation method is applied to prevent the problem of overfitting. The effectiveness of this new method is evaluated using simulated noisy chaotic time series as well as real-life oceanic radar signals. Results show that the proposed method can find the correct number of hidden units of an RBF network for an optimal prediction.","1941-0093","","10.1109/72.950144","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=950144","","Chaos;Radial basis function networks;Neural networks;Function approximation;Least squares approximation;Chaotic communication;Working environment noise;Radar detection;Weather forecasting;Speech coding","radar signal processing;prediction theory;chaos;time series;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;radial basis function networks","chaotic time series;radial basis function neural network;RBF neural nets;signal subspace;eigenvectors;cross validation;radar signals;prediction theory;chaos","","141","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Univ., Toronto, Ont., Canada","IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","","2001","12","3","567","584","In the paper, a type of thresholding neural network (TNN) is developed for adaptive noise reduction. New types of soft and hard thresholding functions are created to serve as the activation function of the TNN. Unlike the standard thresholding functions, the new thresholding functions are infinitely differentiable. By using the new thresholding functions, some gradient-based learning algorithms become possible or more effective. The optimal solution of the TNN in a mean square error (MSE) sense is discussed. It is proved that there is at most one optimal solution for the soft-thresholding TNN. General optimal performances of both soft and hard thresholding TNNs are analyzed and compared to the linear noise reduction method. Gradient-based adaptive learning algorithms are presented to seek the optimal solution for noise reduction. The algorithms include supervised and unsupervised batch learning as well as supervised and unsupervised stochastic learning. It is indicated that the TNN with the stochastic learning algorithms can be used as a novel nonlinear adaptive filter. It is proved that the stochastic learning algorithm is convergent in certain statistical sense in ideal conditions. Numerical results show that the TNN is very effective in finding the optimal solutions of thresholding methods in an MSE sense and usually outperforms other noise reduction methods. Especially, it is shown that the TNN-based nonlinear adaptive filtering outperforms the conventional linear adaptive filtering in both optimal solution and learning performance.","1941-0093","","10.1109/72.925559","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=925559","","Neural networks;Adaptive systems;Noise reduction;Finite impulse response filter;Nonlinear filters;Adaptive filters;Mean square error methods;Stochastic resonance;Linear systems;Wideband","noise;unsupervised learning;filtering theory;adaptive filters;nonlinear filters;mean square error methods;wavelet transforms;signal processing","thresholding neural network;adaptive noise reduction;hard thresholding functions;soft thresholding functions;activation function;gradient-based learning algorithms;linear noise reduction;adaptive learning algorithms;unsupervised batch learning;supervised batch learning;stochastic learning;nonlinear adaptive filter","","61","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The increased bitline leakage causes slow or incorrect read/write operation of an SRAM because the leakage current acts as noise current for a sense amplifier. In this paper, the problem has been solved from a circuitry point of view, and the scheme which detects the bitline leakage current in a precharge cycle and compensates for it during a read/write cycle is proposed. Employing this scheme, the SRAM with 360-/spl mu/A bitline leakage current can perform a read/write operation at the same speed as one that has no bitline leakage current. This enables a 0.1-V reduction in V/sub TH/, and keeps the V/sub TH/ and delay scalability of a high-performance SRAM in technology progress.

The tensor-rank approximation is designed such that the SVD decomposition emerges in the special case where all the input matrices are the repeatition of a single matrix. We evaluate the coding technique both in terms of regression, i.e., the efficiency of the technique for functional approximation, and classification. We find that for regression the tensor-rank coding, as a dimensionality reduction technique, significantly outperforms other techniques like PCA.

Computationally, the algorithm is a simple, noninvasive, recursive procedure that avoids any form of explicit autocorrelation matrix inversion, decomposition, or diagonalization. Theoretical analysis reveals basic properties of the algorithm and establishes formal convergence. When the input autocorrelation matrix is replaced by a conventional sample-average (positive definite) estimate, the algorithm effectively generates a sequence of MVDR filter estimators; the bias converges rapidly to zero and the covariance trace rises slowly and asymptotically to the covariance trace of the familiar sample-matrix-inversion (SMI) estimator. In fact, formal convergence of the estimator sequence to the SMI estimate is established. However, for short data records, it is the early, nonasymptotic elements of the generated sequence of estimators that offer favorable bias covariance balance and are seen to outperform in mean-square estimation error, constraint-LMS, RLS-type, orthogonal multistage decomposition, as well as plain and diagonally loaded SMI estimates.

This multistage process may be nonrobust in the presence of even small errors in prior guesses about angles and number of sources generated by inherent limitations of the preprocessing and may lead to catastrophic errors in practical applications. A new approach to wideband direction finding is introduced and described. The proposed strategy combines a robust near-optimal data-adaptive statistic, called the weighted average of signal subspaces (WAVES), with an enhanced design of focusing matrices to ensure a statistically robust preprocessing of wideband data.

Latency-insensitive designs are synchronous distributed systems and are realized by composing functional modules that exchange data on communication channels according to an appropriate protocol. The protocol works on the assumption that the modules are stallable, a weak condition to ask them to obey. The goal of the protocol is to guarantee that latency-insensitive designs composed of functionally correct modules behave correctly independently of the channel latencies. This allows us to increase the robustness of a design implementation because any delay variations of a channel can be ""recovered"" by changing the channel latency while the overall system functionality remains unaffected. As a consequence, an important application of the proposed theory is represented by the latency-insensitive methodology to design large digital integrated circuits by using deep submicrometer technologies.","1937-4151","","10.1109/43.945302","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=945302","","Protocols;Design methodology;Clocks;Integrated circuit technology;Integrated circuit interconnections;Communication channels;Application specific integrated circuits;Integrated circuit synthesis;Delay estimation;Assembly systems","industrial property;digital integrated circuits;integrated circuit design;protocols;telecommunication channels","latency-insensitive design;correct-by-construction methodology;complex system;intellectual property;synchronous distributed system;protocol;digital integrated circuit;deep submicron technology;formal method;functional module;data exchange;communication channel;delay recovery","","218","","44","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since the bandwidth of this estimator is rather limited, it can be used in combination with the traditional numerical differentiation approach in order to cover a wide velocity range. It was shown in various simulations and experiments that this combined acceleration estimator can yield accurate acceleration estimates over a wide range of velocities. Furthermore, when this estimator is applied to a friction compensation system, the effect of low-velocity friction can be reduced significantly by its capability to detect small changes in acceleration caused by friction.","1941-014X","","10.1109/3516.914392","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=914392","","Acceleration;Optical sensors;Friction;Velocity measurement;Optical pulses;Pulse measurements;Yield estimation;Servomechanisms;Sampling methods;Optical filters","encoding;optical instruments;acceleration measurement;differentiation;numerical analysis;servomotors","acceleration estimator;low-velocity region;low-acceleration region;encoder position data;numerical differentiation;optical encoder signal;displacement signal;limited bandwidth estimator;friction compensation system;servomotors","","50","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The class-based recognition problem is similarly defined: Given a single image of an object in a database of images of other objects, some of them multiply sampled under varying illumination, identify (match) any novel image of that object under varying illumination with the single image of that object in the database. We focus on Lambertian surface classes and, in particular, the class of human faces. The key result in our approach is based on a definition of an illumination invariant signature image which enables an analytic generation of the image space with varying illumination. We show that a small database of objects-in our experiments as few as two objects-is sufficient for generating the image space with varying illumination of any new object of the class from a single input image of that object. In many cases, the recognition results outperform by far conventional methods and the re-rendering is of remarkable quality considering the size of the database of example images and the mild preprocess required for making the algorithm work.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.908964","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=908964","","Image recognition;Lighting;Rendering (computer graphics);Image databases;Image generation;Image analysis;Humans;Face;Photometry;Layout","rendering (computer graphics);object recognition;face recognition","quotient image;class-based re-rendering;class-based recognition;varying illuminations;image-based recognition;Lambertian surface classes;human faces;illumination invariant signature image","","415","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For the most part, these devices are used separately, and their applications do not interact. Imagine, however, if they could interact directly and thus create a network where information may flow seamlessly between the devices-such a network of personal devices is often referred to as a personal area network, or PAN. Moreover, access to the Internet via a (public) wireless LAN access point and/or via a 3G UMTS mobile phone would enable the PAN to be constantly online. The strongest candidate to provide the cheap short-range radio links necessary to enable such networks is the Bluetooth wireless technology. Seen from a networking perspective, a PAN will be expected to have participants, both of its ""own"" devices and ""guest"" devices from other PANs, continuously moving in and out of its coverage. To cope with this volatile nature of the network, the concept of ad hoc networking may be applied to create robust and flexible connectivity. A major technical step is taken when the Bluetooth piconet network architecture, a strict star topology, is extended into a scatternet architecture, where piconets are interconnected. A consequence of creating scatternet-based PANs is that some nodes will form gateways between piconets, and these gateways must be capable of time sharing their presence In each piconet of which they are members. While the Bluetooth standard defines the gateway nodes, the actual mechanisms and algorithms that accomplish the interpiconet scheduling (IPS) are left rather open. Given the lack of research literature in the subject, an overall architecture for handling scheduling in a scatternet is presented. A family of feasible IPS algorithms, referred to as rendezvous point algorithms, is also introduced and discussed.","1558-156X","","10.1109/65.953231","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=953231","","Bluetooth;Personal area networks;Scattering;Personal digital assistants;Mobile handsets;Portable computers;Digital cameras;DVD;Application software;Internet","personal communication networks;wireless LAN;local area networks;picocellular radio;packet radio networks;network topology;Internet;internetworking","personal area networking;ad hoc networking;portable electronic devices;notebook computers;mobile phones;PDA;digital cameras;mp3/MD/DVD players;PAN;Internet access;public wireless LAN;3G UMTS mobile phone;short-range radio links;Bluetooth wireless technology;Bluetooth piconet network architecture;star topology;scatternet architecture;piconet interconnection;network nodes;time sharing;Bluetooth standard;gateway nodes;scatternet scheduling;IPS algorithms;rendezvous point algorithms;interpiconet scheduling;packet forwarding","","102","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

"Inverse control of systems with hysteresis and creep","P. Krejci; K.

One reason for this is the increasing number of mechatronic applications that use solid-state actuators based on magnetostrictive or piezo-electric material or shape memory alloys. All of these actuator types show strong hysteretic effects. In addition to hysteresis, piezo-electric actuators show strong creep effects. Thus, the objective of the paper is to enlarge the operator-based methodology of hysteresis operators by elements that allow the description of systems with hysteresis and creep. To reach this objective, following the procedure used for hysteretic systems, creep operators are introduced to form, together with the hysteresis operators, a system operator for the simultaneous consideration of both phenomena. With regard to applications in control and measurement technology, the existence, uniqueness, Lipschitz continuity and thus input-output stability of its inverse operator are theoretically supported by functional analytical methods. Subsequently, the efficiency of this new concept is demonstrated, in practice, by a real-time inverse feedforward controller for piezo-electric actuators. Using this control concept, the tracking errors caused by hysteretic and creep effects are reduced by approximately one order of magnitude.","1350-2379","","10.1049/ip-cta:20010375","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=935761","","","hysteresis;piezoelectric actuators;creep;input-output stability;functional analysis;discrete time systems;feedforward","inverse control;hysteresis operators;solid-state actuators;creep effects;existence;uniqueness;Lipschitz continuity;inverse operator;functional analytical methods;real-time inverse feedforward controller;tracking errors;creep operators","","169","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals"

The model construction part replaces the nonlinear dynamics of a system with a generalized form of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems, which is newly developed by us. The generalized form has a decomposed structure for each element of A/sub i/ and B/sub i/ matrices in consequent parts. The key feature of this structure is that it is suitable for constructing IF-THEN rules and reducing the number of IF-THEN rules. The rule reduction part provides a successive procedure to reduce the number of IF-THEN rules. Furthermore, we convert the reduction error between reduced fuzzy models and a system to model uncertainties of reduced fuzzy models. The robust compensation part achieves the decay rate controller design guaranteeing robust stability for the model uncertainties.

The nonlinear v-obstacle allows selecting a single avoidance maneuver (if one exists) that avoids any number of obstacles moving on any known trajectories. For unknown trajectories, the nonlinear v-obstacles can be used to generate local avoidance maneuvers based on the current velocity and path curvature of the moving obstacle. This elevates the planning strategy to a second order method, compared to the first order avoidance using the linear v-obstacle, and zero order avoidance using only position information. Analytic expressions for the nonlinear v-obstacle are derived for general trajectories in the plane.

Rise and fall times below 20 pS are achieved. The driver employs a novel dual-mode actively matched output buffer that provides a dc-coupled back termination of either 25 or 50 /spl Omega/. Compared to an output buffer with a resistive termination, this buffer dissipates only half as much power. In addition, the buffer has the the ability to reject external bias and will therefore not load bias sources used to set laser threshold currents and modulator offset voltages. The low power consumption makes the IC most suitable for co-packaging with uncooled lasers and electro-absorption modulators.

As a critical step in modeling with /spl alpha/-stable distributions, the problem of estimating the parameters of stable distributions have been addressed by several works in the literature. However, many of these works consider only the special case of symmetric stable random variables. This is an important restriction, however, since most real-life signals are skewed. The existing techniques on estimating skewed distribution parameters are either computationally too expensive, require lookup tables, or have poor convergence properties. We introduce three novel classes of estimators for the parameters of general stable distributions, which are generalizations of the methods previously suggested for parameter estimation of symmetric stable distributions. These estimators exploit expressions we develop for fractional lower order, negative order, and logarithmic moments and tail statistics. We also introduce simple transformations that allow one to use existing symmetric stable parameter estimation techniques. Techniques suggested in this paper provide the only closed-form solutions we are aware of for parameters that may be efficiently computed. Simulation results show that at least one of our new estimators has better performance than the existing techniques over most of the parameter space. Furthermore, our techniques require substantially less computation.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.950775","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=950775","","Parameter estimation;Maximum likelihood estimation;Random variables;Geophysics computing;Convergence;Probability distribution;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Computer networks;Hydrology","parameter estimation;statistical analysis;signal processing;transforms","skewed /spl alpha/-stable distributions;density parameter estimation;impulsive data modeling;symmetric stable random variables;real-life signals;skewed distribution parameters;symmetric stable distributions;fractional lower order moments;negative order moments;logarithmic moments;tail statistics;transformations;symmetric stable parameter estimation;closed-form solutions;simulation results;parameter space;signal processing;Monte Carlo evaluation","","78","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This normalization process can produce a loss of information and hence a lack of precision in the final results. In this paper, we shall present a type of multigranular linguistic contexts we shall call linguistic hierarchies term sets, such that, when we deal with multigranular linguistic information assessed in these structures we can unify the information assessed in them without loss of information.

Meanwhile, it can be combined with either the observation at the other angles to become an L-band two-dimensional (2D) or a multiple dimensional observation mode, or with the observation at 6.9 or 10.7 GHz to become a multiple frequency/dimensional observation mode. In this paper, it is shown that the sensitivity of radiobrightness at AMSR channels to SM is increased by incorporating L-band radiobrightness. In addition, the advantage of an L-band 2D or a multiple dimensional observation mode over an L-band 1D observation mode is demonstrated.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.942544","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=942544","","Soil moisture;Brightness temperature;L-band;Samarium;Frequency;Surface soil;Microwave propagation;Backpropagation;Neural networks;Microwave radiometry","soil;moisture measurement;hydrological techniques;remote sensing;terrain mapping;radiometry;geophysics computing;neural nets;backpropagation","hydrology;soil moisture;remote sensing;measurement technique;land surface;microwave radiometry;brightness temperature;neural network;neural net;simulation;retrieval;error propagation learning backpropagation;UHF;SHF;L-band;SMOS;AMSR;land surface process radiobrightness model;multiple viewing angle;prairie grassland;1.4 to 10.7 GHz","","28","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

EGM as one of the dynamic link architectures uses not only face-shape but also the gray information of image, and the Fisherface algorithm as a class-specific method is robust about variations such as lighting direction and facial expression. In the proposed face recognition adopting the above two methods, the linear projection per node of an image graph reduces the dimensionality of labeled graph vector and provides a feature space to be used effectively for the classification. In comparison with the conventional method, the proposed approach could obtain satisfactory results from the perspectives of recognition rates and speeds.

The basic idea consists of introducing low-pass structures within bandpass topologies. By adjusting low-pass filter cutoff frequencies, harmonic resonances are attenuated, while maintaining in-band performances. In addition, transmission losses may be reduced as the insertion technique leads to optimum designs in terms of overall size. The approach described here is based upon the combination of classical synthesis techniques and optimization procedures provided by conventional computer-aided-design tools. Experimental results are obtained in the case of /spl lambda//sub g//4 shunt-stub filters implemented in classical semilumped low-pass architectures. Then, we investigate alternative integration technologies and techniques to improve the out-of-band rejection over very wide operating bandwidth. To overcome some design limitations, i.e., workable characteristic impedance value, we propose and validate a multilayer solution.

Microprocesses and Nanotechnology 2001. 2001 International Microprocesses and Nanotechnology Conference (IEEE Cat. No.01EX468)","","2001","","","72","","Summary form only given. Nanotechnology is currently the focus of much investment in the USA and worldwide. In the USA, the federal government has an initiated a broad and ambitious program entitled the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI). It is important to realize that the NNI involves almost all the various US government agencies that are involved in sponsoring basic research and development. The NNI can be viewed as an umbrella for funding research at the forefront of fields across the hard and soft sciences. It should also be noted that the significant budgets now being dedicated to the NNI are not all 'new' money. In many cases, they represent a redirection of existing budget lines. In addition to this federal program, there are a number of equally ambitious state based programs sponsoring nanotechnology. The California investment is perhaps the most visible and includes the creation of the California Nanosystems Institute. Other states have adopted a similar strategy of leveraging their own investment by attracting federal and private funding. A significant fraction of these state investments is going into bricks and mortar and can perhaps best be viewed as a way to boost investment in the infrastructure of university based research. Ultimately, it is believed that the current US investment in nanotechnology will be beneficial to the economic prosperity of the USA. Interestingly, venture capital firms are investing in nanotechnology start-ups. This comes at a time when venture capital financing has dropped dramatically from the last few years. It seems certain that the range of products and applications will be as diverse as the current nanotechnology investment.","","4-89114-017-8","10.1109/IMNC.2001.984080","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=984080","","Nanotechnology;Molecular electronics;Venture capital;US Government;US Government agencies;Research and development;Nanoelectronics","nanotechnology;investment;economics;research initiatives","nanotechnology;investment;federal government program;National Nanotechnology Initiative;NNI;US government agencies;research and development;research funding;budget redirection;California Nanosystems Institute;federal funding;private funding;state investments;infrastructure investment;university based research;US investment;venture capital;economic prosperity;nanotechnology start-ups;venture capital financing","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Modified vector rotational CORDIC (MVR-CORDIC) algorithm and architecture","Cheng-Shing Wu; An-Yeu Wu","Dept. of Electr. Eng., Nat. Central Univ., Chung-Li, Taiwan; NA","IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","","2001","48","6","548","561","The CORDIC algorithm is a well-known iterative method for the computation of vector rotation. However, the major disadvantage is its relatively slow computational speed. For applications that require forward rotation (or vector rotation) only, we propose a new scheme, the modified vector rotational CORDIC (MVR-CORDIC) algorithm, to improve the speed performance of CORDIC algorithm. The basic idea of the proposed scheme is to reduce the iteration number directly while maintaining the SQNR performance. This can be achieved by modifying the basic microrotation procedure of CORDIC algorithm. Meanwhile, three searching algorithms are suggested to find the corresponding directional and rotational sequences so as to obtain the best SQNR performance. Three SQNR performance refinement schemes are also suggested in this paper. Namely, the selective prerotation scheme, selective scaling scheme, and iteration-tradeoff scheme. They can reduce and balance the quantization errors encountered in both microrotation and scaling phases so as to further improve the overall SQNR performance. Then, by combining these three refinement schemes, we provide a systematic design flow as well as the optimization procedure in the application of MVR-CORDIC algorithm. Finally, we present two VLSI architectures for the MVR-CORDIC algorithm. It shows that by using the proposed MVR-CORDIC algorithm, we can save 50% execution time in the iterative CORDIC structure, or 50% hardware complexity in the parallel CORDIC structure compared with the conventional CORDIC scheme.","1558-125X","","10.1109/82.943326","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=943326","","Iterative algorithms;Quantization;Vectors;Computer architecture;Very large scale integration;Hardware;Digital signal processing;Digital arithmetic;Lattices;Digital filters","digital arithmetic;iterative methods;vector quantisation;VLSI","modified vector rotational CORDIC;MVR-CORDIC;iterative method;computational speed;SQNR performance;microrotation procedure;searching algorithms;selective prerotation scheme;selective scaling scheme;iteration-tradeoff scheme;quantization errors;systematic design;VLSI architectures;execution time;hardware complexity","","41","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This can be cancelled using a low pass filter although it would introduce delays and obscure any real oscillations in the fundamental frequency. Alternatively, averaging over three phases could be used but higher harmonics in the oscillation of the estimation would be present.","1937-4208","","10.1109/61.924812","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=924812","","Frequency estimation;Phase estimation;Performance analysis;Power system protection;Control equipment;Robust control;Power system analysis computing;Power system control;Power systems;Discrete Fourier transforms","power system protection;power system control;discrete Fourier transforms;parameter estimation;phase estimation;frequency estimation","frequency tracking methods;fundamental power frequency;protection equipment;control equipment;power system conditions;linear estimation of phases;single phase decomposition;orthogonal components;discrete Fourier transform;low pass filter;zero crossing methods;quadratic form;demodulation;nonlinear least squares estimation","","73","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this technique, current sources are added to the inverting or noninverting op-amp terminals such that the op-amp input common-mode voltages can be set close to one of the supply rails to allow low-voltage operation. An automatic frequency and Q tuning technique is proposed for tuning the active filter using programmable capacitor arrays (PCAs). The proposed tuning technique does not require any peak detectors, which are difficult to implement at a low supply voltage. Instead, it uses a few analog comparators, a digital comparator, and a few binary counters to adjust the PCAs. To demonstrate the proposed techniques, a 1-V 1-MHz second-order filter fabricated in a conventional 1.2-/spl mu/m CMOS process is presented. For a 5-kHz input signal, the filter achieves a THD of -60.2 dB for a peak-to-peak output voltage of 600 mV. The frequency tuning range is between 585 kHz and 1.325 MHz.

"Operational experience of HVDC Light/sup TM/","K. Eriksson","ABB, Sweden","Seventh International Conference on AC-DC Power Transmission","","2001","","","205","210","HVDC Light/sup TM/ is an electric power transmission technology based on voltage source converters with pulse width modulation and modern HVDC cables. This type of converter with modern power electronics has interesting characteristics based on separate and fast-acting controls of active and reactive powers. The technology is well suited for connection of networks that otherwise are difficult or impossible to interconnect. It's suitability is based on accurate control of the transmitted active power and independent control of the reactive power in the connected AC networks. HVDC Light/sup TM/ is designed at standard units between 10 and 300 MW and are built in transportable housings. This together with the above technical, characteristics make them suitable for various applications of power transmission, such as exchange of power between networks, infeed of wind power to a network or as a feeder to an isolated load. There are four HVDC Light/sup TM/ transmissions in operation in the world: one each in the countries of Sweden, Denmark, Australia and US. The HVDC Light/sup TM/ links so far in operation or under construction have been justified for network interconnection or infeed of windpower. The speed and accuracy of both active and reactive controls have been used in customised ways in each of the above projects and is a key to success for HVDC Light/sup TM/ projects. As the first project, the Gotland Light in Sweden started operation in November 1999 and the others came along during 2000.

A particularly attractive approach, in fading environments, is to exploit the variations in the channel conditions, and transmit to the user with the currently 'best' channel. We show that the 'best' user may be identified as the maximum-rate user when the feasible rates are weighed with some appropriately determined coefficients. Interpreting the coefficients as shadow prices, or reward values, the optimal strategy may thus be viewed as a revenue-based policy. Calculating the optimal revenue vector directly is a formidable task, requiring detailed information on the channel statistics. Instead, we present adaptive algorithms for determining the optimal revenue vector on-line in an iterative fashion, without the need for explicit knowledge of the channel behavior. Starting from an arbitrary initial vector, the algorithms iteratively adjust the reward values to compensate for observed deviations from the target throughput ratios. The algorithms are validated through extensive numerical experiments. Besides verifying long-run convergence, we also examine the transient performance, in particular the rate of convergence to the optimal revenue vector. The results show that the target throughput ratios are tightly maintained, and that the algorithms are well able to track changes in the channel conditions or throughput targets.","0743-166X","0-7803-7016-3","10.1109/INFCOM.2001.916290","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=916290","","Heuristic algorithms;Throughput;Delay;Fading;Rayleigh channels;Base stations;Statistics;Iterative algorithms;Convergence;Adaptive algorithm","packet radio networks;delays;telecommunication congestion control;data communication;telecommunication traffic;fading channels;optimisation;adaptive systems;iterative methods;convergence of numerical methods;transient analysis;time-varying channels","dynamic rate control algorithms;HDR throughput optimization;delay tolerance;data applications;bursty traffic characteristics;transmission scheduling;throughput optimisation;fading environments;channel conditions;maximum-rate user;shadow prices;reward values;revenue-based policy;optimal revenue vector;channel statistics;adaptive algorithms;iterative method;wireless networks;numerical experiments;long-run convergence;transient performance;convergence rate;target throughput ratios;packet delay;high data rate","","146","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the paper, capability of adaptation of the proposed control system to variance of the environment is verified through numerical simulations and hardware experiments. With the input signals from the touch sensors at the tips of the legs, the nonlinear oscillators tune the phase differences among them through mutual entertainments.

Concepts like power flow, loop flow, and reactive power, which once mattered only to the engineers directly involved in grid operations, now must be made intuitive. This is because they must be communicated to public service commissions and the consumer-voters to whom such boards are answerable.

Starting with zero amount of training data and then proceeding with neural-network training in a stage-wise manner, the algorithm can automatically produce a neural model that meets the user-desired accuracy. In each stage, the algorithm utilizes neural-network error criteria to determine additional training/validation samples required and their location in model input space. The algorithm dynamically generates these new data samples during training, by automatic driving of simulation tools (e.g., OSA90, Ansoft-HFSS, Agilent-ADS). Initially, fewer hidden neurons are used, and the algorithm adjusts the neural-network size whenever it detects under-learning. Our technique integrates all the subtasks involved in neural modeling, thereby facilitating a more efficient and automated model development framework. It significantly reduces the intensive human effort demanded by the conventional step-by-step neural modeling approach. The algorithm inherently distinguishes nonlinear and smooth regions of model behavior and uses relatively fewer samples in smooth subregions. It automatically deals with large data errors that can occur during dynamic sampling by using a Huber quasi-Newton technique. The algorithm is demonstrated through practical microwave device and circuit examples.","1557-9670","","10.1109/22.971611","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=971611","","Robustness;Neural networks;Microwave devices;Neurons;Humans;Design automation;Electromagnetic modeling;Microwave measurements;Microwave theory and techniques;Coplanar waveguides","neural nets;circuit CAD;software tools;learning (artificial intelligence);printed circuits;Schottky gate field effect transistors;capacitors;microwave power amplifiers;semiconductor device models;error analysis;Newton method;microwave field effect transistors;microwave circuits","robust neural-network model development algorithm;automatic neural-network model development;microwave applications;neural-network-based RF/microwave model development process;training data;neural-network training;stage-wise training;neural model;user-desired accuracy;neural-network error criteria;training/validation samples;model input space;dynamic data sample generation;training;simulation tools;OSA90;Ansoft-HFSS;Agilent-ADS;hidden neurons;neural-network size;under-learning;neural modeling subtask integration;neural modeling;automated model development framework;nonlinear regions;Huber quasi-Newton technique;microwave device;microwave circuit;smooth regions;model behavior;smooth subregions;data errors;dynamic sampling;computer-aided-design;CAD;microwave modeling;microwave design;MESFET;embedded capacitor;multilayer printed circuit boards;power amplifier","","107","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Relations between fractional operations and time-frequency distributions, and their applications","Soo-Chang Pei; Jian-Jiun Ding","Dept. of Electr. Eng., Nat. Taiwan Univ., Taipei, Taiwan; NA","IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","","2001","49","8","1638","1655","The fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) is a useful tool for signal processing. It is the generalization of the Fourier transform. Many fractional operations, such as fractional convolution, fractional correlation, and the fractional Hilbert transform, are defined from it. In fact, the FRFT can be further generalized into the linear canonical transform (LCT), and we can also use the LCT to define several canonical operations. In this paper, we discuss the relations between the operations described above and some important time-frequency distributions (TFDs), such as the Wigner distribution function (WDF), the ambiguity function (AF), the signal correlation function, and the spectrum correlation function. First, we systematically review the previous works in brief. Then, some new relations are derived and listed in tables. Then, we use these relations to analyze the applications of the FRPT/LCT to fractional/canonical filter design, fractional/canonical Hilbert transform, beam shaping, and then we analyze the phase-amplitude problems of the FRFT/LCT. For phase-amplitude problems, we find, as with the original Fourier transform, that in most cases, the phase is more important than the amplitude for the FRFT/LCT. We also use the WDF to explain why fractional/canonical convolution can be used for space-variant pattern recognition.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.934134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=934134","","Time frequency analysis;Fourier transforms;Convolution;Distribution functions;Filters;Signal processing;Pattern recognition;Hilbert space;Helium;Signal analysis","Wigner distribution;convolution;correlation theory;fast Fourier transforms;time-frequency analysis;Hilbert transforms;image recognition;band-pass filters;band-stop filters","fractional operations;time-frequency distributions;fractional Fourier transform;FRFT;signal processing;fractional convolution;fractional correlation;fractional Hilbert transform;linear canonical transform;LCT;canonical operations;Wigner distribution function;ambiguity function;signal correlation function;spectrum correlation function;fractional filter design;canonical filter design;canonical Hilbert transform;beam shaping;phase-amplitude problems;FRFT/LCT;space-variant pattern recognition;images","","162","","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method employs a noise and speech-dependent gain function for each frequency component. Proper measures have been taken to obtain a corresponding causal filter and also to ensure that the circular convolution originating from fast Fourier transform (FFT) filtering yields a truly linear filtering. A novel method that uses spectrum-dependent adaptive averaging to decrease the variance of the gain function is also presented.

Dynamic programming can be used to find segments that minimize the intra-segment variances. While this method produces optimal solutions, it is too slow for long sequences of data. We present and analyze randomized variations of the algorithm.

For the case of the half-wavelength dipole, a maximum error of 12.0 dB (for directions of very low radiation) and an average error of 1.6 dB were obtained; for a uniform array of two dipoles radiating in a half-plane (which leads to a similar GSM panel-antenna's radiation pattern), the average error was 1.8 dB (on the whole sphere). Measurements were also conducted in a real GSM network, and different approximations for the base-station radiation pattern were compared.

Sub-pixel estimation using parabola fitting over three points with their similarity measures is also a common method to increase the resolution of matching. However, few investigations or studies concerning the characteristics of this estimation have been reported. In this paper we have analyzed the sub-pixel estimation error by using an approximate image function and three kinds of similarity measures for matching. The results illustrate some inherently problematic phenomena such as so called ""pixel-locking"". In addition to this, we propose a new algorithm to greatly reduce sub-pixel estimation error. This method is independent from the similarity measure and quite simple to implement. The advantage of our novel method is confirmed through experiments using three different types of images.","","0-7695-1143-0","10.1109/ICCV.2001.937503","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=937503","","Estimation error;Optical imaging;Area measurement;Fluidics;Histograms;Pixel;Transfer functions;Apertures;Information science;Image processing","stereo image processing;image sequences;image matching","precise sub-pixel estimation;area-based matching;image-based measurements;stereo image processing;fluidics;parabola fitting;similarity measures;approximate image function;inherently problematic phenomena;sub-pixel estimation error;similarity measure","","47","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paths chosen are straight lines and arcs of circles. When reversing, the truck and trailer under examination can be modeled as an unstable nonlinear system with state and input saturations. The simplified goal of stabilizing along a trajectory (instead of a point) allows us to consider a system with controllable linearization. Still, the combination of instability and saturations makes the task impossible with a single controller. In fact, the system cannot be driven backward from all initial states because of the jack-knife effects between the parts of the multibody vehicle; it is sometimes necessary to drive forward to enter into a specific region of attraction. This leads to the use of hybrid controllers.

A hierarchical partitioning of motions by speed in an MHI pyramid enables efficient calculation of image motions using fixed-size gradient operators.

However, most hard real-time systems could miss some deadlines provided that it happens in a known and predictable way. Also, adding predictability on the pattern of missed deadlines for soft and firm real-time systems is desirable, for instance, to guarantee levels of quality of service. We introduce the concept of weakly hard real-time systems to model real-time systems that can tolerate a clearly specified degree of missed deadlines. For this purpose, we define four temporal constraints based on determining a maximum number of deadlines that can be missed during a window of time (a given number of invocations). This paper provides the theoretical analysis of the properties and relationships of these constraints. It also shows the exact conditions under which a constraint is harder to satisfy than another constraint.

This article presents some of the results of the Fourth Generation Wireless project (4GW) of the Personal Computing and Communications program (PCC), the major Swedish academic research effort on future communications systems, launched in late 1997. In the 4GW project, scenarios have been used as tools for formulating relevant research topics related to future wireless systems. By working with scenarios the project group has been able to challenge some of the assumptions commonly made in the field of wireless research. Since the project group is multidisciplinary, the work has also helped the members of the project group to understand the differences between the research traditions to which they belong. The scenarios, as well as the ensuing research into various wireless related topics, point to a vision of fourth-generation systems where ""low-hierarchy"" user-deployed infrastructures are the prime candidate. Fourth-generation systems will offer short- to moderate-range communications with very high data rates (>100 Mb/s). They are likely to employ array signal processing and ad hoc operation to provide the required coverage. A key aspect of their design will be the fact that they will be deployed in environments where large-scale wireless, and wired, infrastructures are already in operation.","1558-0652","","10.1109/98.972165","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=972165","","Frequency;Wireless communication;Uncertainty","mobile radio;technological forecasting;research initiatives;packet radio networks;telecommunication network planning","4th-generation wireless infrastructures;4G mobile communications;Fourth Generation Wireless project;4GW project;Personal Computing and Communications program;Swedish academic research effort;low-hierarchy user-deployed infrastructures;moderate-range communications;short-range communications;very high data rates;array signal processing;ad hoc operation;research challenges","","77","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The breakdown is caused by defect generation in the oxide. Although electron trap generation has received much attention, there is little information available on the hole trap generation. The relatively high potential barrier for holes at the oxide/Si interface makes it difficult to achieve a high level of hole injection. Most previous work was limited to an injection level Q/sub inj/ of 10/sup 14/ cm/sup -2/. In this paper, we investigate the hole trapping and trap generation when Q/sub inj/ reaches the order of 10/sup 18/ cm/sup -2/. When Q/sub inj/<10/sup 15/ cm/sup -2/, the trapping is dominated by the as-grown traps. As Q/sub inj/ increases further, however, it is found that the generation of new traps controls the trapping. The trap generation does not saturate up to the oxide breakdown. The trapping kinetics for both the as-grown and the generated traps is studied. The relationship between the density of generated traps and the Q/sub inj/ is explored. Attention is paid to how the trapping and trap generation depends on the distance from the interface. In contrast to the uniform generation of electron traps across the oxide, we found that the hole trap generation was not uniform and it moved away from the interface as Q/sub inj/ increased.","1557-9646","","10.1109/16.925238","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=925238","","Silicon compounds","silicon compounds;semiconductor-insulator boundaries;dielectric thin films;hole traps;interface states;semiconductor device breakdown;semiconductor device reliability;MOSFET","hole trapping;hole trap generation;gate oxide;oxide breakdown;defect generation;oxide/Si interface;hole injection;trapping kinetics;as-grown traps;generated trap density;CMOS devices;MOS devices;SiO/sub 2/-Si","","55","","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Lower profile and lighter weight are among the desirable features. Whether the system provides narrow band services, such as voice, fax and data, or broadband services, such as Internet and multimedia, the flat antenna can be an attractive alternative to other more volumetric reflector antennas. This paper surveys the applications that may use this type of antenna and reviews some of the developments for terminals in a number of military and commercial systems. A parametric sizing of the antenna is presented at different frequency bands. Four actual realizations are presented. The first is a realization at Ku-band for the global broadcast satellite (GBS) system. This realization uses four flat plate panels with a waveguide combiner to reduce the losses and increase the G/T of the antenna. This demonstrates the feasibility of using the flat plate antenna for medium data rate (MDR) SATCOM-on-the-move (SOTM) and SATCOM-on-the-pause (SOTP) terminals. The examples for commercial applications include a Ku-band briefcase mobile terminal in a code-division multiple access (CDMA) system, a briefcase mobile terminal at S-band for the INSAT satellite system and a Ka-band realization that can be applied to future SATCOM systems as well as local multimedia distribution systems (LMDS).","","0-7803-7225-5","10.1109/MILCOM.2001.985951","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=985951","","Costs;Broadband antennas;Satellite broadcasting;Multimedia systems;Reflector antennas;Multiaccess communication;Antenna arrays;Nonhomogeneous media;Printed circuits;Narrowband","planar antenna arrays;millimetre wave antenna arrays;microstrip antenna arrays;UHF antennas;satellite ground stations;mobile satellite communication;code division multiple access;multimedia communication;military communication;direct broadcasting by satellite;antenna feeds;slot antenna arrays;strip line components","flat antenna arrays;multilayer printed circuit technology;commercial SATCOM terminals;military SATCOM terminals;Ku-band;global broadcast satellite system;waveguide combiner;SATCOM-on-the-move;SATCOM-on-the-pause;briefcase mobile terminal;CDMA;S-band;INSAT;Ka-band;local multimedia distribution systems;LMDS;stripline-fed slot arrays","","5","","4","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two transformer connections for providing this combination service are the ungrounded wye-delta and the open wye-open delta. Each connection has its good points and bad points. Of concern are the three-phase voltages provided the induction motor. If the voltages are unbalanced, depending upon the degree of unbalance, the induction motor is subject to overheating. Sources of the voltage unbalance can be the unequal spacing between conductors of the primary and secondary lines, the transformer ratings and connection, and the amount of single-phase load relative to the three-phase load. This paper utilizes previously published models of the primary and secondary lines, transformer connections, and induction motors. A simple system is developed to demonstrate the voltage unbalance created by these components under normal and abnormal conditions and the effect of the resulting unbalances on the induction motor. The system model also provides an insight into the voltages that can appear across the transformer terminals during abnormal operating conditions.","1939-9367","","10.1109/28.903142","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=903142","","Voltage;Induction motors;Conductors;Cause effect analysis;Industry Applications Society;Power engineering computing;Power engineering and energy;Steady-state;Circuits;Fuses","induction motors;load (electric);power transformers;transformer windings;power distribution faults","ungrounded wye-delta transformer;unbalanced voltages;causes and effects;distribution system;single-phase lighting loads;three-phase induction motor;open wye-open delta transformer","","31","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The computational complexity of adaptation algorithms is proportional to the number of filter coefficients. This implies that, for long adaptive filters, the adaptation task can become prohibitively expensive, ruling out cost-effective implementation on digital signal processors. The purpose of partial coefficient updates is to reduce the computational complexity of an adaptive filter by adapting a block of the filter coefficients rather than the entire filter at every iteration. In this paper, we develop a selective-partial-update normalized least-mean-square (NLMS) algorithm, and analyze its stability using the traditional independence assumptions and error-energy bounds. Selective partial updating is also extended to the affine projection (AP) algorithm by introducing multiple constraints.

A 275/spl times/5600 /spl mu/m 1D CMUT array element is experimentally characterized, and the results are found to be in agreement with theoretical predictions. As a receiver, the transducer has a 0.28-fm//spl radic/Hz displacement sensitivity, and, as a transmitter, it produces 5 kPa/V of output pressure at the transducer surface at 3 MHz with a DC bias of 35 V. The transducer has more than 100% fractional bandwidth around 3 MHz, which makes it suitable for ultrasound imaging. The radiation pattern of isolated single elements, as well as those of array elements are measured, and two major sources of acoustical crosstalk are identified. A weakly dispersive non-leaky interface wave (Stoneley wave) is observed to be propagating at the silicon substrate-fluid interface at a speed close to the speed of sound in the fluid. This wave causes internal reflections, spurious resonance, and radiation from the edges of the silicon substrate. The large lateral component of the particle velocity generated by the membranes at the edge of the cMUT array elements is found to be the source of this interface wave. Lowest order Lamb waves in the silicon substrate are also found to contribute to the crosstalk between elements. These waves are excited at the edges of individual vibrating membranes, where they are anchored to the substrate, and result in a narrowing of the beam profile of the array elements. Several methods, such as trench isolation and wafer thinning, are proposed and implemented to modify the acoustical cross coupling between array elements.","1525-8955","","10.1109/58.920706","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=920706","","Ultrasonic transducers;Silicon;Ultrasonic transducer arrays;Ultrasonic imaging;Crosstalk;Biomembranes;Transmitters;Acoustic transducers;Bandwidth;Acoustic imaging","capacitive sensors;ultrasonic transducer arrays;ultrasonic imaging;surface acoustic wave transducers;acoustic receivers;crosstalk;equivalent circuits;membranes;microsensors;micromachining;isolation technology","1D arrays;capacitive micromachined US transducers;immersion transducer arrays;displacement sensitivity;acoustic receiver;acoustic transmitter;ultrasound imaging;radiation pattern;isolated single elements;acoustic crosstalk sources;Stoneley wave;silicon substrate-fluid interface;internal reflections;spurious resonance;large lateral component;membranes;lowest order Lamb waves;beam profile narrowing;trench isolation;wafer thinning;acoustical cross coupling;equivalent circuit model;two-port network;275 micron;5600 micron;3 MHz;Si","","112","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Space Res. & Technol. Centre, Noordwijk, Netherlands; NA; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","2001","39","1","142","150","This paper presents the passive reflectometry and interferometry system (PARIS) concept and how it originated in the European Space Agency (ESA), Noordwijk, The Netherlands, in 1993 as a novel method to perform mesoscale ocean altimetry. The PARIS concept uses signals of opportunity such as the signals from the global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), which are reflected off the ocean surface to perform mesoscale ocean altimetry. Essentially, the relative delay between the direct and the reflected signals received from a Low Earth Orbit satellite provides information about sea surface height. The paper describes an original experiment on sea surface altimetry using GPS-reflected signals. The objective of the experiment was to demonstrate the potential of the PARIS concept. This experiment is the first one ever published on performing sea surface height estimations using reflected navigation signals in a controlled environment. The key result of the experiment is the demonstration of a root mean squared (RMS) height accuracy within 5 s of 1% of the used code chip (3 m for C/A code). Direct extrapolation of this experimental result to the 10-times higher chip rate P-code signal allows us to predict a height error of 30 cm in 5 s, provided adequate models are used to take into account systematic effects. The paper ends presenting the potential of the PARIS concept for long term ocean altimetric observations in view of the current trends of the GNSS systems.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.898676","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=898676","","Sea surface;Oceans;Altimetry;Satellite navigation systems;Low earth orbit satellites;Reflectometry;Interferometry;Global Positioning System;Delay;Extrapolation","oceanographic techniques;remote sensing;remote sensing by radar","ocean;sea level;sea surface height;dynamics;remote sensing;measurement technique;bistatic radar;GPS;Global Positioning System;PARIS concept;experimental demonstration;sea surface altimetry;reflected signal;radiowave reflection;passive reflectometry;passive reflectometry and interferometry system;mesoscale;global navigation satellite systems;GNSS","","122","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Sci., Vrije Univ., Brussels, Belgium; NA","Proceedings of the 11th IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing (Cat. No.01TH8563)","","2001","","","158","161","Ground penetrating radar (GPR) has become widely accepted as a major technique for subsurface investigations, mainly in civil engineering. Considerable efforts are put in the development of GPR systems for the detection of shallow buried landmines. However, the GPR performs inadequately due to clutter, which dominates the data and obscures the mine information. The clutter varies with surface roughness and soil conditions and lead to uncertainty in the measurements. It is therefore necessary to overcome these surrounding effects when processing GPR data for detecting small, shallow buried objects. We present improved signal processing techniques which can be used to reduce the clutter through data preprocessing. Several approaches are proposed for the GPR clutter reduction techniques, most of them model the clutter statistically. The proposed clutter reduction technique models the clutter using parametric modeling. The clutter contained in the measurements is treated as an ARMA model. The advantage of such approach lies therein that once the clutter is satisfactorily known, any target will show up as a small anomaly in against the known clutter background. This method suggests that the clutter shows a certain amount of correlation. Experimentally it is shown that the dominant interference in GPR data is correlated clutter, i.e., interference, which has a large correlation coefficient for tags greater than zero. However, the clutter environment cannot be considered completely stationary. An ideal filter would then be an adaptive filter, which estimates the slowly varying local clutter parameters, all the time ignoring the small parameter jumps caused by the buried targets to be detected. Kalman filtering is used for the estimation of the clutter parameters in the presence of random noise, detects jumps that occur at unknown points in time, and provides estimates of the new parameter values, without altering the target return.","","0-7803-7011-2","10.1109/SSP.2001.955246","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=955246","","Signal processing;Parameter estimation;Clutter;Ground penetrating radar;Landmine detection;Buried object detection;Interference;Adaptive filters;Radar signal processing;Civil engineering","radar clutter;radar imaging;buried object detection;parameter estimation;adaptive Kalman filters;adaptive signal processing;filtering theory;autoregressive moving average processes;random noise;signal representation","signal processing;clutter parameters estimation;clutter removal;GPR data processing;landmine detection;ground penetrating radar;civil engineering;GPR systems;buried landmines;radar clutter;GPR Bscan images;surface roughness;soil conditions;measurement uncertainty;data preprocessing;GPR clutter reduction;parametric modeling;ARMA model;correlation;interference;correlation coefficient;adaptive filter;local clutter parameters estimation;Kalman filtering;random noise","","16","","4","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Eng., Tel Aviv Univ., Israel","IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","","2001","9","4","333","337","Falls are common among the elderly and often cause injuries. They most frequently occur during walking and are associated with the chronic deterioration in neuromuscular and sensory systems, as well as with ankle dorsiflexor muscular weakness and lowered endurance of these muscles to fatigue. In the present study, a three-dimensional (3-D) finite element model of the structure of the foot was utilized to determine the effects of ankle dorsiflexor muscle weakness on the structural stability of the foot and, consequently, on the risk of falls during gait. The medial-lateral tendency of instability of the foot during gait in such conditions of weakness was analyzed by means of this model to identify the most important muscles used in controlling foot stability in affected individuals. The values of the eccentricity of the center of pressure under the heel during foot placement were used to indicate the degree of foot stability. The computational analysis indicated that it is the tibialis anterior muscle's weakness that dramatically decreases foot stability. Clinical investigation is now needed to correlate the significance of tibialis anterior muscle weakness with other known risk factors affecting the tendency to falls among the elderly, e.g., deterioration of sensory abilities. Rehabilitation practitioners and physical therapists may apply the present analytic approach to evaluate the stability of a foot before treatment and compare the predicted with the actual therapeutic results in terms of optimization of foot-ground pressure.","1558-0210","","10.1109/7333.1000112","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1000112","","Foot;Senior citizens;Muscles;Stability analysis;Injuries;Legged locomotion;Neuromuscular;Fatigue;Finite element methods;Structural engineering","geriatrics;muscle;gait analysis;finite element analysis;physiological models;mechanical stability;patient rehabilitation","foot-ground contact stress;muscle weakness;plantar pressure;elderly persons;ankle dorsiflexor weakness;gait characteristic;foot stability simulations;three-dimensional finite element model;falls risk;tibialis anterior muscle;rehabilitation;stance phase;inversion-eversion motion","Accidental Falls;Aged;Computer Simulation;Finite Element Analysis;Foot;Frail Elderly;Gait;Gravitation;Humans;Joint Instability;Models, Biological;Muscle Weakness;Musculoskeletal Equilibrium;Posture","19","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Cache decay: exploiting generational behavior to reduce cache leakage power","S. Kaxiras; Zhigang Hu; M. Martonosi","NA; NA; NA","Proceedings 28th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","","2001","","","240","251","Power dissipation is increasingly important in CPUs ranging from those intended for mobile use, all the way up to high performance processors for high-end servers. While the bulk of the power dissipated is dynamic switching power leakage power is also beginning to be a concern. Chipmakers expect that in future chip generations, leakage's proportion of total chip power will increase significantly. This paper examines methods for reducing leakage power within the cache memories of the CPU. Because caches comprise much of a CPU chip's area and transistor counts, they are reasonable targets for attacking leakage. We discuss policies and implementations for reducing cache leakage by invalidating and ""turning off"" cache lines when they hold data not likely to be reused. In particular our approach is targeted at the generational nature of cache line usage. That is, cache lines typically have a flurry of frequent use when first brought into the cache, and then have a period of ""dead time"" before they are evicted. By devising effective, low-power ways of deducing dead time, our results show that in many cases we can reduce Ll cache leakage energy by 4/spl times/ in SPEC2000 applications without impacting performance. Because our decay-based techniques have notions of competitive on-line algorithms at their roots, their energy usage can be theoretically bounded at within a factor of two of the optimal oracle-based policy. We also examine adaptive decay-based policies that make energy-minimizing policy choices on a per-application basis by choosing appropriate decay intervals individually, for each cache line. Our proposed adaptive policies effectively reduce Ll cache leakage energy by 5/spl times/ for the SPEC2000 with only negligible degradations in performance.","1063-6897","0-7695-1162-7","10.1109/ISCA.2001.937453","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=937453","","Power generation;Power dissipation;Turning;Central Processing Unit;Leakage current;Circuits and systems;Cache memory;Thermal degradation;Pressing;Energy management","microprocessor chips;performance evaluation;cache storage","cache decay;generational behavior;cache leakage power;power dissipation;CPUs;high performance processors;high-end servers;dynamic switching power;leakage power;cache memories;SPEC2000 applications","","283","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The purposes of this study are (1) to estimate the operator's action in the initial stage of the motion, (2) to propose the method for realizing the power assist corresponding to the operator's motion. We include the following mechanism into HAL system: (1) the mechanism which estimate the reference input of the bend angle of a joint by using myoelectricity, (2) the mechanism which autonomously generates the motion using phase sequence. For optional steps, experiments were performed to realize the stepping-up motion which reflects the intention of the operator. As the result, HAL started the autonomous motion immediately when the operator intended to start the motion, and stepping-up motion which reflected the intention of the operator was able to be achieved, even if the operator hardly generated the power.","","0-7803-6612-3","10.1109/IROS.2001.977204","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=977204","","Predictive control;Motion estimation;Torque;Phase estimation;Fasteners;Legged locomotion;Leg;Power generation;Power engineering and energy;Systems engineering and theory","handicapped aids;robots;predictive control;electromyography","predictive control;operator intention estimation;stepping-up motion;exo-skeleton type power assist system;HAL;force signal;Hybrid Assistive Leg;walking aid;operator action estimation;myoelectricity;phase sequence;motion generation;lower body disability;disabled person","","37","","4","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A CMOS proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT) current generator using substrate bipolar transistors creates the current that increases with temperature. A CMOS threshold voltage extractor circuit creates the conversely proportional to absolute temperature (CTAT) current that decreases with increasing temperature. The reference operates over a temperature range of 0 to 100/spl deg/C with a power supply voltage between 3.3 and 7 V. Simulations show that over these conditions, the output voltage varies by less than 1% over the specified temperature range while using less than 75 /spl mu/A of current.","","0-7803-6742-1","10.1109/SSMSD.2001.914931","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=914931","","Voltage;Circuits;Resistors;Temperature dependence;Power supplies;Photonic band gap;CMOS technology;MOSFETs;Bipolar transistors;Temperature distribution","current-mode circuits;CMOS analogue integrated circuits;reference circuits","current-mode CMOS voltage reference;temperature independent characteristic;temperature dependent currents;reference voltage;proportional to absolute temperature current generator;substrate bipolar transistors;threshold voltage extractor circuit;conversely proportional to absolute temperature current;power supply voltage;output voltage;0 to 100 degC;3.3 to 7 V","","11","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
