We show that the acoustic level Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) features, the phase level modified group delay cepstral coefficients (MGDCC) and the phonetic level phoneme posterior probability (PPP) tandem features are effective for the countermeasure. Furthermore, feature level fusion of these features before i-vector modeling also enhance the performance. A polynomial kernel support vector machine is adopted as the supervised classifier. In order to enhance the generalizability of the countermeasure, we also adopted the cosine similarity and PLDA scoring as one-class classifications methods. By combining the proposed i-vector subsystems with the OpenSMILE baseline which covers the acoustic and prosodic information further improves the final performance. The proposed fusion system achieves 0.29% and 3.26% EER on the development and test set of the database provided by the INTERSPEECH 2015 automatic speaker verification spoofing and countermeasures challenge.","","978-9-8814-7680-7","10.1109/APSIPA.2015.7415492","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7415492","speaker verification;spoofing and countermeasures;i-vector;modified group delay cepstral coefficients;phoneme posterior probability","Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Speech;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Training","acoustic signal processing;cepstral analysis;security of data;sensor fusion;signal classification;speaker recognition;speech synthesis;support vector machines","SYSU system;interspeech 2015 automatic speaker verification spoofing;countermeasures challenge;speaker verification system;spoofing attack;speech synthesis;voice conversion;play back;spoofed speech signal;score level fusion approach;i-vector subsystem;acoustic level mel-frequency cepstral coefficient feature;MFCC feature;phase level modified group delay cepstral coefficient;MGDCC;phonetic level phoneme posterior probability tandem feature;PPP tandem feature;feature level fusion;i-vector modeling;polynomial kernel support vector machine;supervised classifier;cosine similarity;PLDA scoring;one-class classifications method;OpenSMILE baseline;acoustic information;prosodic information;fusion system","","7","25","","25 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By comparing with the scattering loss of mode in no suspended case, the contributions of bottom roughness scattering to the optical losses increase exceeding 50% in the shallowly suspended counterparts.

We also performed a set of post-processing scheme including Laplacian of Gaussian operator and contrast enhancement to process images taken by the CMOS detector at a lower dose. In addition, a dual-energy subtraction technique was used to demonstrate its capability of dual-energy imaging. In dual-angle single-exposure scenario, white noise caused by scattering can be removed by a simple subtraction method.

Conventional researches on Russia population prediction are usually based on the standard cohort-component method. Such a method only allows for several factors (fertility, mortality and migration rates), and then leads to the lack of all-sidedness in the prediction results. With outstanding generalization ability, the feedforward neuronet is considered to be a more appropriate substitute. Besides, the back-propagation (BP) is of the most widely-used feedforward neuronet. As the conventional back-propagation neuronet has some inherent weaknesses, in this paper, two types of improved feedforward neuronet are constructed for the Russia population prediction. More specifically, a type of 3-layer power-activated neuronet (PAN) equipped with the BP algorithm (BP-PAN) and a type of 3-layer PAN equipped with the weights-and-structure-determination (WASD) algorithm (WASD-PAN) are built on the basis of 2013-year (from 1AD to 2013AD) historical population data for the Russia population prediction. By a lot of numerical experiments, the future declining trend of Russia population in the next decade is predicted with the highest possibility. In addition, via the Russia population prediction, the comparisons on the performance between the WASD neuronet and BP neuronet are conducted and summarized.","","978-1-4799-1717-4","10.1109/ICICIP.2015.7388158","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7388158","Russia population prediction;weights-and-structure-determination;feedforward neuronet;back-propagation neuronet","Sociology;Statistics;Neurons;Prediction algorithms;Feedforward neural networks;Data models;Training","backpropagation;demography;feedforward neural nets","optimal WASD neuronet;rough BP neuronet;Russia population prediction problem;cohort-component method;migration rates;fertility rates;mortality rates;outstanding generalization ability;backpropagation neuronet;improved feedforward neuronet;3-layer power-activated neuronet;BP-PAN algorithm;weights-and-structure-determination algorithm","","1","17","","21 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address the issues of centralized control strategies, i.e. single point failure, information congestion, etc., this paper proposes a distributed suboptimal control strategy to maintain the supply-demand balance by controlling the battery storage system. Only information exchange among neighboring nodes is required, therefore, the computation and communication burden is allocated to local controllers to avoid the investment of expensive and powerful central controller. The stability of the proposed control algorithm is proved by rigid analysis. Comparison between the proposed distributed control and centralized optimal control strategy is conducted, and the effectiveness of the proposed control solution is demonstrated by the simulation results.

For the agitator tank, there are two control variables, which are accurate concentration and moderate liquid level. In other words, the proposed discontinuous signum-activated ZD controllers are designed to make the two variables of the agitator tank converge to desired trajectories. Moreover, signum function, as a kind of discontinuous activated function, has easier circuit implementation and thus is introduced as an activation function for handling agitator tank as an attempt. Besides, different tracking trajectories are used, and corresponding simulation results are shown in this paper. The simulation results, compared with the ZD controllers using the linear activation function, further verify the relative effectiveness of the discontinuous signum-activated ZD controllers. In addition, the simulation results also simultaneously show that the discontinuous signum-activated ZD controllers of the agitator tank may oscillate under certain frequencies.","","978-1-5090-5521-0","10.1109/ICSAI.2016.7810921","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7810921","signum activation function;ZD controllers;agitator tank;tracking control","Liquids;Trajectory;Simulation;Mathematical model;Convergence;Standards","chemical variables control;level control;materials handling equipment;sampled data systems;tanks (containers);transfer functions","discontinuous signum-activated ZD controllers;agitator tank;Zhang dynamics controllers;signum function;discontinuous activated function;linear activation function;concentration variable;liquid level variable","","1","24","","9 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Population growth is a root cause of many environmental and social problems. Therefore, it is of vital importance to make population predictions. However, predictions based on standard cohort-component method fails to consider all relevant impact factors and may neglect some important uncertainty factors. To overcome the inherent limitations, in this article, we present a Chebyshev-activation WASD neuronet approach for the population prediction. This neuronet method is applied to predicting European population, with numerous numerical experiments conducted as a research basis to guarantee the feasibility and validity of our approach.

Based on previous researches, the dynamic methods consist of Zhang dynamics (ZD) and gradient dynamics (GD). In this paper, by using ZD twice and not using GD, a controller named Z2G0 is investigated for resolving the redundancy of robot manipulators.

This emulator is needed in order to test the control electronics of the cooling system without the cooling system itself. The cooling system will be assembled and integrated separately and with a different schedule. Using the EGSE, with a proper emulation software, it will also be possible to simulate the behavior of the cooling system in space. The tracker cooling system includes a set of different sensors and actuators which are necessary for bringing the tracker detector to a uniform temperature at which it can operate properly. The sensors include: Pt1000 thermistors, semiconductor thermal sensors, differential and absolute pressure sensors, and pump rotational speed sensors. The actuators are: resistive heaters, Peltier heat pumps and liquid pumps. The EGSE should simulate the behavior of all these sensors and actuators. This means that it must generate the same signals from the electrical point of view but also its global behavior, namely the response to any internal and external condition change should be the same as the actual tracker cooling system. In order to achieve this performance appropriate software that includes the simulated response of the tracker cooling system will be developed. The EGSE has been developed in three phases: in phase 1 we emulated the electrical behavior of each sensor or actuator as a single unit, in phase 2 we integrated those sensors in a single unit and we added a USB computer interface and basic control software. In phase 3 we will develop software emulating the behaviour of the entire tracker cooling system.","1082-3654","978-1-4244-0922-8","10.1109/NSSMIC.2007.4436359","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4436359","","Ground support;Silicon;Electronics cooling;Actuators;Thermal sensors;Electronic equipment testing;Temperature sensors;Heat pumps;Space stations;International Space Station","computer interfaces;high energy physics instrumentation computing;nuclear electronics;particle tracks;silicon radiation detectors;thermistors","electronic ground support equipment;silicon tracker cooling system;AMS-02 experiment;space experiment;cosmic ray;international space station;control electronics;emulation software;tracker cooling system;actuators;Pt1000 thermistors;semiconductor thermal sensors;differential pressure sensors;pump rotational speed sensors;resistive heaters;Peltier heat pumps;USB computer interface;control software","","","3","","22 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such a scheme combines the velocity-level minimum kinetic energy (MKE) scheme and the torque-level IIWT minimization scheme via two weighting factors, which guarantees the stability and final joint-velocity of motion to be near zero. Since the IIWT scheme is an optimization scheme with global characteristics and the MKE scheme is a local counterpart of the global kinetic energy minimization scheme, the proposed DLSM based MKE-IIWT scheme (or termed, the DLSM-MKE-IIWT scheme) possesses the advantages of both local and global optimization schemes. Based on Zhang-equivalency lemma and the relation between joint torque and joint acceleration, such a DLSM-MKE-IIWT scheme is finally reformulated as a unified quadratic program (QP). Computer simulation performed on a 3 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) redundant robot manipulator comparatively verifies the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed DLSM-MKE-IIWT scheme.","","978-1-5090-5363-6","10.1109/ITOEC.2017.8122428","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8122428","different-level simultaneous minimization (DLSM);inertia-inverse weighted torque (IIWT);minimum kinetic energy (MKE);Zhang equivalency;physically-constrained manipulators","Manipulators;Torque;Minimization;Acceleration;Kinetic energy;Performance analysis","manipulator kinematics;minimisation;quadratic programming;redundant manipulators;stability;torque","local optimization schemes;global optimization schemes;joint torque;joint acceleration;redundant robot manipulator;DLSM based MKE-IIWT scheme;joint-variable oscillation;instability;nonzero final joint-velocity phenomenon;joint-physical limits;joint angle;joint velocity;different-level simultaneous minimization technique;velocity-level minimum kinetic energy scheme;torque-level IIWT minimization scheme;global kinetic energy minimization scheme;QP-unification;QP-verification;unified quadratic program;Zhang-equivalency lemma","","1","16","","30 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To improve the movement stability, an EMG-based admittance control scheme (EACS) was proposed, comprised of an EMG-driven musculoskeletal model (EDMM), an admittance filter and an inner position controller. To investigate the performance of EACS, a series of sinusoidal tracking tasks were conducted with 12 healthy participants and 4 stroke survivors in an ankle exoskeleton in comparison with the EMG-based open-loop control scheme (EOCS). The experimental results indicated that both EACS and EOCS could improve stroke survivors ankle range of motion (ROM). The experimental results of both healthy participants and stroke survivors showed that the assistance torque, tracking error and jerk values of EACS were lower than those of EOCS. The interaction torque of EACS decreased towards the increasing assistance ratio while that of EOCS increased. Moreover, the EMG levels of tibialis anterior (TA) decreased towards the increasing assistance ratio but were higher than those of EOCS. EACS was effective in improving movements stability, and had the potential to be applied in robot-assisted rehabilitation training to address the foot-drop problem.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2020.3012296","the National Key R and D Program of China; Guangdong Science and Technology Plan Project; Shenzhen Science and Technology Plan Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9151287","Stroke;admittance control;surface electromyography (sEMG);human-robot cooperation control;robot-assisted rehabilitation","Electromyography;Admittance;Exoskeletons;Torque;Stability analysis;Robots;Muscles","","","","","","","28 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

There exist two key issues for this problem. Firstly, it is difficult to explore time-dependent interactions between modalities and focus on the important time steps. Secondly, processing the long fused sequence of utterances is susceptible to the forgetting problem due to the long-term temporal dependency. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical learning architecture to classify utterance-level sentiment. To address the first issue, we perform time-step level fusion to generate fused features for each time step, which explicitly models time-restricted interactions by incorporating information across modalities at the same time step. Furthermore, based on the assumption that acoustic features directly reflect emotional intensity, we pioneer emotion intensity attention to focus on the time steps where emotion changes or intense affections take place. To handle the second issue, we propose Residual Memory Network (RMN) to process the fused sequence. RMN utilizes some techniques such as directly passing the previous state into the next time step, which helps to retain the information from many time steps ago.

Therefore, we propose an Adapted Dynamic Memory Network (A-DMN) where self and inter-speaker influences are modelled individually and further synthesised oriented towards the current utterance. Specifically, we model the dependency of the constituent utterances in a dialogue video using a global RNN to capture inter-speaker influence. Likewise, each speaker is assigned an RNN to capture their self influence. Afterwards, an Episodic Memory Module is devised to extract contexts for self and inter-speaker influence and synthesise them to update the memory. This process repeats itself for multiple passes until a refined representation is obtained and used for final prediction.

To overcome the aforementioned limitations, in this paper, we present a 3-layer feedforward neuronet (i.e., neural network) approach equipped with a weights-and-structuredetermination (WASD) algorithm for the population prediction of China. Numerical experiments further substantiate the feasibility of such an approach and indicate that there are three kinds of possibilities for the progress of China's population in the next decade.

To achieve superior performance, the jerk-level CMP scheme is improved by the feedback control, which further leads to a jerk-level cyclic motion planning and control (CMPC) scheme. The cyclic motion criterion and the avoidance of joint physical limits (e.g., joint-angle, joint-velocity, joint-acceleration and joint-jerk limits) are both considered into the jerk- level CMP and CMPC schemes. More importantly, the correctness of the presented jerk-level schemes is guaranteed by the corresponding engineering-type theoretical analyses and results.

During the transmission of DMT signal, Chow Cioffi Bingham algorithm-based bit-loading (CCB-BL) and discrete-Fourier-transform spread (DFT-spread) techniques are both discussed in the bandwidth-limited communication system. For the PAM single carrier communication system, look-up table (LUT) pre-distortion and time-domain pre-equalization schemes are jointly employed at the transmitter side to mitigate nonlinear distortions and insufficient bandwidth induced impairments, respectively. The results show that 105-Gbit/s DFT-spread DMT, 115-Gbit/s CCB-BL DMT and 120-Gbit/s PAM-8 signals are successfully transmitted over 40-km single mode fiber (SMF) with the bit-error-rate (BER) below hard decision forward error correction (HD-FEC) threshold of 3.8x10$^3$. 120-Gbit/s DFT-spread DMT and CCB-BL DMT signals allocated within 20-GHz bandwidth can be successfully transmitted over 20-km SMF, and the receiver sensitivity of DFT-spread DMT outperforms CCB-BL DMT by 1.5-dB at the BER of 3.8x10$^3$. Due to the flexibility of bit-loading technique, when the allocated bandwidth of 120-Gbit/s CCB-BL DMT signal extends from 20-GHz to 25-GHz, the required received optical power (ROP) of CCB-BL DMT can be lower than DFT-spread DMT by 1-dB at the BER of 3.8x10$^3$ over 20-km SMF transmission. In 120-Gbit/s PAM-8 system, LUT pre-distortion technique improves the system receiver sensitivity by more than 1-dB over 40-km SMF transmission. This is the first time to discuss and implement different advanced modulation formats to achieve 100-Gbit/s/λ transmission in a 40-km amplifier-less IM-DD system with a low-cost O-band 10G class DML. Both CCB-BL DMT and LUT pre-distortion assisted PAM-8 can achieve a BER lower than HD-FEC threshold of 3.8x10$^3$ when the net rate per optical carrier is higher than 100-Gbit/s, which are promising solutions for 40-km four-lane 400-GbE DCI-Edge applications.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2020.3004007","National Science Foundation of China; The Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province; National Key RD Program of China; Local Innovation and Research Teams Project of Guangdong Pearl River Talents Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9122464","100-Gbit;discrete multi-tone (DMT);pulse amplitude modulation (PAM);amplifier-less transmission;intensity modulation direct detection (IM-DD);40-km datacenter interconnect edge (DCI-Edge);10G-class directly modulated laser (DML)","","","","","","","","22 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, the vectorization procedure may be troublesome, and it can be difficult if not impossible to vectorize a complicated matrix-valued ODE (especially when it is nonlinear).

To eliminate the lagging errors of time-varying four fundamental operations in potential signal processing systems, based on Zhang dynamics (ZD), real-time computing models for four fundamental operations of time-varying numbers are proposed, constructed and investigated. The lagging-error-free solutions for four fundamental operations of time-varying numbers are obtained in this paper. Through four concise lemmas, the lagging-error-free properties are guaranteed.

To cope with these problems, we propose an online algorithm for UAV swarms to jointly optimize the computation offloading and multi-hop routing scheduling in the Edge-Cloud environment. First, we propose a UAV-Edge-Cloud computing model to meet the requirements of latency and computing capability. We then formulate a joint optimization of workflow assignment and multihop routing scheduling in order to minimize the computation cost and latency. To tackle this NP-hard problem, an algorithm based on the Markov approximation technique is designed to obtain near-optimal solutions. Furthermore, to achieve high longterm performance in online environments, we exploit Lyapunov optimization to control the migration cost caused by the dynamics of application and environment. Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate that our approach achieves a long-term highefficiency and stable performance in an online environment for UAV swarms with respect to computation offloading and traffic routing.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2020.2994541","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9093980","UAV swarm;edge computing;cloud computing;computation offloading","Task analysis;Cloud computing;Optimization;Routing;Computational modeling;Servers;Unmanned aerial vehicles","","","","","","","14 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this paper, we firstly propose a simple pseudoinverse-based solution at the jerk level to solve the IK problem by using direct derivative dynamics (DDD or D3 for short) thrice and without using Zhang dynamics (ZD), which is thus termed D3Z0 type. Note that, though the D3Z0 solution is simple, it has some inherent weaknesses, such as low control precision and lack of necessary feedbacks. Therefore, as an important branch of dynamics methods, ZD is adopted to solve the above weaknesses. According to the number of times of using ZD, three enhanced solutions termed D2Z1, D1Z2 and D0Z3 types are then proposed and investigated. Specifically, D2Z1 means that we use 3D twice and ZD once to construct the solution, and D1Z2 and D0Z3 can be obtained and defined similarly. Moreover, feedbacks of position, velocity and acceleration levels can be partially or fully incorporated into the D2Z1, D1Z2 and D0Z3 solutions. Meanwhile, based on D3Z0, D2Z1, D1Z2 and D0Z3 solutions, a relatively complete framework of DZ-type solutions is thus proposed for solving the IK problem at the jerk level. Finally, simulation results performed on a five-link redundant manipulator substantiate the effectiveness and superiority of the DZ-type solutions for manipulator motion planning and control, which further show both smooth and efficient tracking performance, especially for solving the jerk-level IK redundancy of manipulators.","","978-1-4799-3650-2","10.1109/ICICIP.2014.7010328","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7010328","","Acceleration;Manipulators;Convergence;Joints;Simulation;Trajectory;Planning","manipulator dynamics;manipulator kinematics;motion control;path planning;redundant manipulators","pseudoinverse-based jerk-level solutions;redundant manipulator inverse kinematics;motion planning;motion control;complicated inverse-kinematic problem;IK problem;direct derivative dynamics;D3ZO type;D3ZO solution;ZD;DOZ3 type;D1Z2 type;D2Z1 type;velocity level;acceleration level;position level;live-link redundant manipulator;jerk-level IK redundancy","","4","11","","15 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Firstly, the presented ZD controller for GC system synchronization with no noise perturbation is analyzed, and the synchronization error as a whole (i.e., in the form of vector norm) between the drive GC system and the response GC system converges globally exponentially to zero. Secondly, the presented ZD controller for GC system synchronization with noise perturbation is analyzed as well, and detailed theoretical analyses (i.e., proofs) and results show that the synchronization error as a whole (i.e., in the form of vector norm) converges globally to a small bound of error. So, the ZD controllers provided in this paper (including the ones with unequal parameters) are not only simple and effective but also quite robust for the GC system synchronization.","","978-1-7281-2485-8","10.1109/SSCI44817.2019.9002889","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9002889","noisy;Zhang dynamics (ZD);Genesio chaotic (GC) system;synchronization;analyses;unequal parameters","Synchronization;Perturbation methods;Nonlinear control systems;Error analysis;Convergence of numerical methods;Chaos;Differential equations","chaos;convergence of numerical methods;error analysis;nonlinear control systems;nonlinear dynamical systems;perturbation techniques;synchronisation","noisy Zhang-dynamics method;Genesio chaotic system synchronization;noise-free;noisy synchronization control;ZD controllers;GC system synchronization;noise perturbation;synchronization error;drive GC system;response GC system","","","9","","20 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To drastically and effectively avoid the Jacobian inversion and to obtain the accurate solution of the time-varying IK problem for redundant robot manipulators, a special type of inverse-free solution, namely of Z1G1 type, is thus proposed and investigated at the joint-acceleration level in this paper.

Unlike the conventional CSK scheme where information bits are mapped to real-valued CSK symbols, in the proposed PM-CCSK scheme, the binary data sequence is split and modulated by two independent CSK modulators to become the real and imaginary parts of complex information symbols. Furthermore, the signs of the real/imaginary parts are determined by additional polarity bits, which create the new PM-CCSK constellation with an increased average Euclidean distance in comparison to conventional CSK constellations. Simulation results show that the proposed PM-CCSK-OFDM system is capable of offering an improved link performance over conventional CSK or O-OFDM systems alone and is flexible for deployment with different types of LED devices.","","978-1-5386-4502-4","10.1109/ICCChina.2017.8330475","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8330475","Visible light communication;colour shift keying;complex colour shift keying;polarity modulation","OFDM;Image color analysis;Modulation;Optical receivers;Optical imaging;Integrated optics;Optical transmitters","free-space optical communication;light emitting diodes;OFDM modulation;optical modulation","optical orthogonal frequency division;high-rate visible light communication systems;VLC systems;information bits;PM-CCSK scheme;binary data sequence;independent CSK modulators;real parts;complex information symbols;PM-CCSK constellation;PM-CCSK-OFDM system;O-OFDM based VLC systems;polarity modulated complex colour shift keying;OFDM-based visible light communication;polarity modulation aided complex colour shift keying;real-valued CSK symbols;polarity bits;imaginary parts","","2","13","","5 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is envisioned that the video content demand of vehicles will explode in the near future. However, the strategy to efficiently distribute video content in large-scale vehicular networks is still absent due to challenges arising from the huge video population, heavy bandwidth consumption, heterogeneous user devices and vehicles' mobility. In this work, we propose to collaboratively replicate video content on Roadside Units (RSUs) to enhance video distribution services based on the fact that the contact period between moving vehicles and a single RSU is not long enough to complete video downloading. In our design, a video file is split into multiple chunks. Each RSU replicates a small number of original chunks and chunks encoded by network coding. Replicating encoded chunks can reduce redundancy of chunks on different RSUs so that RSUs can complement each other better, whereas original chunks can be transrated to chunks with lower bitrates flexibly to fit in users' devices. Therefore, we replicate both original and encoded chunks on RSUs to take advantages of both sides. Stochastic models are employed to analyze chunk download processes and a convex optimization problem is formulated to determine the optimal partition of space allocated to each kind of chunks. Furthermore, we extend our strategy to support video streaming services and empirically prove that the influence caused by limitations of network coding is moderate. In the end, we conduct extensive simulations which not only validate the accuracy of our models but also demonstrate that our strategy can effectively boost video distribution services.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2019.2960022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8933474","Roadside unit;video file downloading;encoded chunks;vehicular networks","Streaming media;Network coding;Bit rate;Encoding;Mobile computing;Stochastic processes;Real-time systems","","","","","","","16 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Methods: Overnight polysomnography recordings were obtained from 33 healthy individuals. The relative spectral powers of five frequency bands, three ECG morphological features and respiratory rate were obtained from six EEG channels, ECG, and oronasal airflow, respectively. The synchronous feature series were interpolated to 1 Hz to retain the high time-resolution required to detect rapid physiological variations. CNS-cardiorespiratory interaction networks were built for each EEG channel and a directionality analysis was conducted using multivariate transfer entropy. Finally, the difference in interaction between Deep, Light, and REM sleep (DS, LS, and REM) was studied. Results: Bidirectional interactions existed in central-cardiorespiratory networks, and the dominant direction was from the cardiorespiratory system to the brain during all sleep stages. Sleep stages had evident influence on these interactions, with the strength of information transfer from heart rate and respiration rate to the brain gradually increasing with the sequence of REM, LS, and DS. Furthermore, the occipital lobe appeared to receive the most input from the cardiorespiratory system during LS. Finally, different ECG morphological features were found to be involved with various central-cardiac and cardiac-respiratory interactions. Conclusion: These findings reveal detailed information regarding CNS-cardiorespiratory interactions during sleep and provide new insights into understanding of sleep control mechanisms.

By traditional approximate matrix inversion algorithms, for example, series expansion, gradient or iteration methods, the proper system performance can be achieved by lower complexity for each recursive expansion or iteration, while keeping lower convergence rate. In this paper, a novel joint conjugate gradient (CG) and Jacobi (JC) iteration method is proposed to speed up the convergence rate as well as guaranteeing the bit error rate (BER) performance. In this proposal, the CG is firstly used twice to find a more accurate searching direction for the following low complexity JC iterations. Numerical simulations and complexity analysis show that, with lower computational complexity, our proposal can obviously outperform previous nonjoint iteration methods. Even compared with recently proposed joint steepest descent and Jacobi method in [7], our proposal can obtain the similar or even better BER performance with faster convergence rate, which indicates lower total hardware implementation complexity and latency.","","978-1-5090-2143-7","10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636727","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7636727","Massive MIMO;joint conjugate gradient and Jacobi iteration algorithm;matrix inversion","Complexity theory;Convergence;Jacobian matrices;MIMO;Precoding;Proposals;Bit error rate","conjugate gradient methods;error statistics;Jacobian matrices;matrix inversion;MIMO communication;precoding","massive multiple-input multiple-output downlink systems;massive MIMO downlink systems;computational complexity;precoding;approximate matrix inversion algorithms;series expansion;joint conjugate gradient method;Jacobi iteration method;convergence rate;bit error rate performance;BER performance;searching direction;nonjoint iteration methods","","6","8","","24 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some parallelization methods adopt separable approximate functions that depend on the degree of parallelism. Such dependencies result in both poor scalability and slow convergence. To address these challenges, in this paper we present a new parallel primal-dual algorithm for DCD, called PPD. In PPD, the block data distribution is utilized to obtain a new approximate function that is independent from the parallelism. Subsequently we design a novel primal-dual acceleration scheme based on PPD to approach the optimal solution closely and quickly.

Numerical experiments show four different trends of TCGD: slightly increasing trend, sharply increasing trend, decreasing-increasing trend and decreasing trend.

To materialize such a vision which is known as edge intelligence, federated learning is emerging as a promising solution to enable edge nodes to collaboratively learn a shared model in a privacy-preserving and communication-efficient manner, by keeping the data at the edge nodes. While pilot efforts on federated learning have mostly focused on reducing the communication overhead, the computation efficiency of those resource-constrained edge nodes has been largely overlooked. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we investigate how to coordinate the edge and the cloud to optimize the system-wide cost-efficiency of federated learning. Leveraging Lyapunov optimization theory, we design and analyze a cost-efficient optimization framework CEFL to make online yet near-optimal control decisions on admission control, load balancing, data scheduling and accuracy tuning for the dynamically arrived training data samples, reducing both computation and communication cost. In particular, our control framework CEFL can be flexibly extended to incorporate various design choices and practical requirements of federated learning, such as exploiting the cheaper cloud resource for model training with better cost-efficiency yet still facilitating on-demand privacy preservation. Via both rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive trace-driven evaluations, we verify the cost-efficiency of our proposed CEFL framework.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.2984332","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9051991","Federated Learning;Distributed Learning;Edge Intelligence;Edge Computing;Online Scheduling.","Computational modeling;Data models;Artificial intelligence;Cloud computing;Training;Internet of Things;Load modeling","","","","","","","31 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In addition, the drift-free scheme could incorporate multiple joint physical limits such as joint limits and joint velocity limits simultaneously. Such a scheme is finally reformulated as a quadratic-programming (QP) problem. Similar to other new types of recurrent neural networks, the dual neural network is piecewise-linear as well and has a simple architecture of only one layer of neurons. As a QP real-time solver, the dual neural network could globally exponentially converge to the optimal solution of a strictly-convex quadratic program.

Among them, some have stringent hard deadlines which can only be satisfied by the emerging paradigm of mobile edge computing (MEC), while the others may pose elastic soft deadlines which can be flexibly fulfilled by cloud computing. However, with the presence of both temporal and spatial diversities of resource cost of MEC and cloud, it remains a practical challenge how to efficiently provision the MEC and cloud resource to minimize the long-term operational cost, while still guaranteeing both hard and soft deadlines for heterogeneous IoT applications. To navigate such an inherent performance-cost tradeoff, an efficient online cloud-edge resource provisioning framework is proposed, based on the delay-aware Lyapunov optimization technique. Without requiring a priori knowledge of the statistics of the cloud-edge system, the proposed framework allows to make online greedy decisions on how much MEC and cloud resources to be provisioned to heterogeneous IoT applications. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we prove that without violating both hard and soft deadlines of heterogeneous IoT applications, the long-term operational cost can be pushed arbitrarily close to the offline optimum.

However, designing effective DCNNs for specific image forensics tasks generally requires domain knowledge and experience gained from abundant experiments, which is time-consuming and labor-expensive. Approaches of automated network designing have been proposed for image classification tasks which are image-content focused, however they may not be suitable to image forensics tasks which rely on identifying subtle traces left by certain image operations. In this paper, we make the first attempt to automate the neural network architecture design for detection of global manipulations. The process of constructing a network is modeled as sequentially selecting optimal architecture modules to generate high-performing CNNs for specific forensic tasks through reinforcement learning. The module-based search space is proposed to make the designing process efficient. Advanced connection patterns (e.g., dense connectivity), which were shown preferred for global manipulation detections, are included in the modules to improve the representational power of the network. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can adaptively construct effective CNN architectures for two common forensic tasks, including multi-purpose forensics and the processing history detection. The auto-designed networks can outperform the state-of-the-art manually designed networks.","1941-0484","","10.1109/JSTSP.2020.2998401","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9103245","global manipulation detection;convolutional neural network;auto-designed network architecture;reinforcement learning;module-based QNN","Task analysis;Computer architecture;Image forensics;Reinforcement learning;Feature extraction;Network architecture","","","","","","","28 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

These solutions only need to calculate the transpose of Jacobian matrix rather than the complex pseudo-inverse of Jacobian matrix, more efficiently resolving the complicated time-varying inverse-kinematics (IK) problem for robot manipulators. Besides, the path-tracking applications based on a 4-link robot manipulator show that the manipulator's motion is pretty smooth, fully illustrating the effectiveness, accuracy and superiority of such inverse-free solutions. Moreover, it is the first time for the researchers to propose a relatively complete inverse-free solution framework at the joint-jerk level.

However, the voice generated by EL is unnatural and unintelligible due to its flat pitch and strong vibration noise. Targeting these challenges, previous works show that the electrolaryngeal speech can be enhanced using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based voice conversion (VC). Although effective in improving the naturalness, it degrades the intelligibility of the converted speech. To address this issue, we propose a hybrid approach using both Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and GMM methods. For better intelligibility, we apply the NMF to estimate the high quality spectral features. For better naturalness, we use the GMM with dynamic trajectory constraint to recover a smoothed F0. Additionally, to suppress the EL vibration noise, we include the 0th MCC coefficient in the GMM-based VC. The proposed method significantly increases the F0 dynamic range, reduces vibration noise, and improves both speech naturalness and intelligibility. One hundred pairs of the normal and electrolaryngeal speech in daily mandarin are recorded as our evaluation data. Experimental results show that our proposed hybrid method reduces the mel-cepstral distortion by 7.1 dB and increases the F0 correlation coefficient to 0.54.","","978-1-5386-1542-3","10.1109/APSIPA.2017.8282244","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8282244","","Speech;Vibrations;Dictionaries;Correlation;Feature extraction;Training data;Distortion","Gaussian processes;matrix decomposition;speech enhancement;speech synthesis","GMM;Nonnegative Matrix Factorization;high quality spectral features;dynamic trajectory constraint;EL vibration noise;speech naturalness;electrolaryngeal speech;mandarin electrolaryngeal voice conversion;speaking-aid device;flat pitch;Gaussian Mixture Model based voice conversion","","1","17","","8 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a novel dimensionality reduction method with the ability to characterize the locally nonlinear geometry of the data by multilocal linearity. Specifically, we first construct a local area for each data point. And based on the overlapping of local areas, each data point will belong to and be linearly reconstructed from several local areas. Next, the set of linear coefficients used to reconstruct the data point constitutes the multilocal linear pattern (MLLP) which is used to characterize the local geometry of the data. Geometrically, the MLLP of a data point represents the hyperplanes in different directions passing through the current point. And the locally nonlinear surface where the data point is located is approximated by these hyperplanes, which is more accurate to reflect the geometry of the data. Then, MLLP is preserved to the embedding data space, and the dimension-reduced data can be obtained by minimizing the reconstruction errors. Finally, experiment results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2020.2999504","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9107495","Dimension reduction;manifold learning;linear coefficients;nonlinear geometry;multilocal linear pattern","Geometry;Manifolds;Feature extraction;Linearity;Principal component analysis","","","","","","","3 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Due to the uncertainty of both the task arrival rates and the prices of the computing resources, it is impossible to make an optimal decision online for a long-running time. Therefore, we propose a two-timescale Lyapunov optimization algorithm to overcome the uncertainty of the system's future information and make the optimal decisions only based on the system's current states. By purchasing computation resources in different timescales from the public cloud and making online decisions on where and how many requests should be offloaded, we can achieve an efficient outcome such that the system performance can approach the offline optimum without requiring a priori knowledge of system statistics.

However, its huge training data requirements and computational load often beyond radar's ability in practical clutter environments. In this paper, we develop a simple but efficient reduced-degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) 3D-STAP method that significantly reduces the required training data and the computational complexity while maintains the sub-optimal clutter suppression performance. The proposed method transforms the planar array data into linear array data in azimuth and in elevation, respectively, and thereby beamforming an equivalent cross-shape array prior to STAP. In consequence, only a few spatial DOFs, including azimuth and elevation dimension, are used for STAP directly resulting in the potential advantage for nonstationary clutter suppression and drastically reducing of training data requirements and computational load. Furthermore, the clutter rank estimation rules of the planar array and transformed cross-shape array are derived, respectively, and the required elevation DOFs of the proposed method is further discussed in detail.

After that, the binary code is processed by AT89S52 microcontroller. This microcontroller is used to generate PWM according to the peak voltage sensed by Peak detector. If the terminal voltage is higher than desired set point, the PWM duty cycle decreases; if terminal voltage is lower than desired set point, the PWM duty cycle increases. PWM signal is fed to IRF740 MOSFET gate terminal. This PWM gate signal hence increases or decreases the field current of generator which in return, increases or decreases terminal voltage.

As the conventional vehicle enters through the gate, the security guard gives this device to the driver and removes it when the vehicle exits. Once activated inside the region, the system monitors the speed of the vehicle and communicates any rule violations to the security station in the premises and also to the driver. If the speed of the vehicle increases beyond the threshold limit, the vehicle driver is alerted and a warning message is communicated to the system. A record of the driving patterns is separately maintained at the receiver unit so that the penalizing action can be taken against the defaulters. The effectiveness of the proposed system is validated with the results of a field trial with different drivers, with and without our hardware prototype installed in the vehicle for a period of two days on a pre-defined route. The average number of over speeds from day 1 to day 2 was reduced by 63%. Our system is promising to increase safety in secured residential areas.","","978-1-4673-9194-8","10.1109/ITNEC.2016.7560418","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7560418","embedded systems;connected vehicles;GPS based speed tracking;driver feedback mechanism;real time systems","Vehicles;Receivers;Global Positioning System;Monitoring;Prototypes;Security;Hardware","road safety;road vehicles;vehicular ad hoc networks","turning conventional vehicles;secured areas;connected vehicles;safety applications;mobile vehicular monitoring;remote vehicular monitoring;speeding vehicles;reckless driving;GPS;wireless hardware system;security station;vehicle driver","","","17","","5 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

After the mapping relationship of these two features is trained, we can use phonetic discriminant features from source speaker to estimate target speaker's spectral features at conversion stage. The phonetic discriminant features are extracted using PCA from the output layer of a deep neural network (DNN) in an automatic speaker recognition (ASR) system. It can be seen as a low dimensional representation of the senone posteriors. We compare the proposed phonetically-aware method with conventional JD-GMM method on the Voice Conversion Challenge 2016 training database.

SIFT's 2-D difference of Gaussian(DoG) in Gaussian Scale-Space(GSS) is separated into two 1-D DoG in x and y dimensions, and the level of scales in DoG pyramid is also reduced. The experiment shows that FG-SIFT reduces the computational complexity about 95% in GSS construction, also increases the accuracy of keypoint detection. Subsequently, the accuracy of generated features is increased 162%, and the accuracy of matched features is increased 8%. Apart from optimization in algorithm level, a hardware architecture of FG-SIFT's keypoint detection module is proposed. With a parallel architectural incorporating a five-stage pipeline, the execution time of keypoint detection is only 1.42ms@Xilinx Virtex5.

It divides the original image into multiple different encrypted images with the same size of the original image and distributes them to multiple different data-hiders for data hiding. Each data-hider can independently embed data into the encrypted image to obtain the corresponding marked encrypted image. The original image can be losslessly recovered by collecting sufficient marked encrypted images from undamaged data-hiders when individual data-hiders are subjected to potential damage. This further protects the security of the original image. We provide four cases of the proposed model, namely, two joint cases and two separable cases.

First, in the conventional generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) distance with agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) framework, besides using the line spectral pair (LSP) based GLR distance, we further propose a weighted summation of multiple GLR distances combining LSP, pitch, energy and phoneme duration information together. Second, since we only want to extract children's speech in high purity for further speech analysis, we utilize a 30 seconds long enrollment utterance from each child to perform supervised child cluster selection using i-vector cosine distance. We find out that performing supervised cluster selection at AHC early stages generates higher purity. We evaluate our methods on a 120 minutes subset data collected from three children during the child-therapist interactions. Experimental results show that our methods significantly outperform the GLR-AHC baseline in terms of child cluster's recall and precision.","","978-1-5090-4294-4","10.1109/ISCSLP.2016.7918477","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7918477","speaker diarization;speaker clustering;autism","Speech;Autism;Feature extraction;Hospitals;Measurement;Data models","audio signal processing;pattern clustering;social sciences computing;voice activity detection","speaker diarization system;autism children real-life audio data;speech analysis;frontend module;daily audio recordings;children speech detection;wearable devices;generalized likelihood ratio distance;agglomerative hierarchical clustering framework;AHC framework;line spectral pair based GLR distance;LSP;weighted summation;phoneme duration information;supervised child cluster selection;i-vector cosine distance;children speech extraction","","1","20","","4 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We validated the accuracy of our pipeline on 32 mitochondria data, each having 6 sequential time-lapse frames. The contour of each mitochondrion is modeled by a curve consisting of a set of landmark points ranging from 39 to 358, with the moving distance between every two consecutive frames quantified for each localized point. The sensitivity of the proposed pipeline, with respect to different curve discretization, was investigated, with high robustness established. In addition, we quantified the uncertainty level of the proposed pipeline using 10 fixed mitochondria data with 6 time frames as well, with the mean between-frame moving distance found to be smaller than 28 nm for a majority of the 10 fixed mitochondria data. This indicates that the proposed pipeline has a very low level of uncertainty.

Specifically, our proposed framework incorporates two components: a recurrent policy network for dynamically specifying a new attended region at each time step based on the status of the super-resolved image and the past attended region sequence, and a local enhancement network for selected patch hallucination and global state updating. The Attention-FH model jointly learns the recurrent policy network and local enhancement network through maximizing a long-term reward that reflects the hallucination result with respect to the whole HR image.

Subsequently, by exploiting the proposed 6IgCFD formula to discretize the continuous-time Zhang neural network model, two new-type discrete-time ZNN (DTZNN) models, namely, new-type DTZNNK and DTZNNU models, are designed and generalized to compute the least-squares solution of dynamic linear equation system with time-varying rank-deficient coefficient in real time, which is quite different from the existing ZNN-related studies on solving continuous-time and discrete-time (dynamic or static) linear equation systems in the context of full-rank coefficients. Specifically, the corresponding dynamic normal equation system, of which the solution exactly corresponds to the least-squares solution of dynamic linear equation system, is elegantly introduced to solve such a rank-deficient least-squares problem efficiently and accurately. Theoretical analyses show that the maximal steady-state residual errors of the two new-type DTZNN models have an O(g4) pattern, where g denotes the sampling gap.

Each agent possesses a time-varying local objective function, and all agents aim to collaboratively track the drifting global optimal solution that minimizes the summation of all local objective functions. The decentralized dynamic optimization problem can be solved by primal or primal-dual methods, and when the problem degenerates to be static, it has been proved in literature that primal-dual methods are superior to primal ones. This motivates us to ask: are primal-dual methods necessarily better than primal ones in decentralized dynamic optimization To answer this question, we investigate and compare convergence properties of the primal method, diffusion, and the primal-dual approach, decentralized gradient tracking (DGT). Theoretical analysis reveals that diffusion can outperform DGT in certain dynamic settings. We find that DGT and diffusion are significantly affected by the drifts and the magnitudes of optimal gradients, respectively. In addition, we show that DGT is more sensitive to the network topology, and a badly-connected network can greatly deteriorate its convergence performance. These conclusions provide guidelines on how to choose proper dynamic algorithms in various application scenarios.

However, existing methods tend to yield overly general captions and consist of some of the most frequent words/phrases, resulting in inaccurate and indistinguishable descriptions (see Figure 1). This is primarily due to (i) the conservative characteristic of traditional training objectives that drives the model to generate correct but hardly discriminative captions for similar images and (ii) the uneven word distribution of the ground-truth captions, which encourages generating highly frequent words/phrases while suppressing the less frequent but more concrete ones. In this work, we propose a novel global-local discriminative objective that is formulated on top of a reference model to facilitate generating fine-grained descriptive captions. Specifically, from a global perspective, we design a novel global discriminative constraint that pulls the generated sentence to better discern the corresponding image from all others in the entire dataset. From the local perspective, a local discriminative constraint is proposed to increase attention such that it emphasizes the less frequent but more concrete words/phrases, thus facilitating the generation of captions that better describe the visual details of the given images. We evaluate the proposed method on the widely used MS-COCO dataset, where it outperforms the baseline methods by a sizable margin and achieves competitive performance over existing leading approaches.

Given a corpus, HDP is able to determine the number of topics automatically, possessing an important feature dubbed nonparametric that overcomes the challenging issue of manually specifying a suitable topic number in parametric topic models, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Nevertheless, HDP requires a much higher computational cost than LDA for parameter estimation. By taking the advantage of multi-threading, a parallel Gibbs sampling algorithm is proposed to estimate parameters for HDP based on the equivalence between HDP and Gamma-Gamma Poisson Process (G2PP) in terms of the generative process. Unfortunately, the above parallel Gibbs sampling algorithm requires to apply the finite approximation on the number of topics manually (i.e., predefine the topic number), thus can not retain the nonparametric feature of HDP. Another drawback of the above models is the lack of capturing the semantic dependencies between words, because the topic assignment of words is independent with each other. Although some works have been done in phrase-based topic modelling, these existing methods are still limited by either enforcing the entire phrase to share a common topic or requiring much complex and time-consuming phrase mining methods. In this paper, we aim to develop a copula guided parallel Gibbs sampling algorithm for HDP which can adjust the number of topics dynamically and capture the latent semantic dependencies between words that compose a coherent segment. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets indicate that our method achieves low perplexities and high topic coherence scores with a small time cost. In addition, we validate the effectiveness of our method on the modelling of word semantic dependencies by comparing the extracted topical phrases with those learned by state-of-the-art phrase-based baselines.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2020.2976945","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9018114","Topic modelling;Parallel Gibbs sampling;Copulas","Semantics;Bayes methods;Inference algorithms;Data models;Computational modeling;Resource management;Approximation algorithms","","","","","","","28 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Traditional static threshold-based decision strategy in the fusion center (FC) can be effective to defend against the deterministic SSDF attacks, but useless for the probability SSDF attacks. In this paper, based on the analysis of relationships between the threshold and the fusion value in the FC, a dynamic threshold-based strategy is proposed to defend against the probability SSDF attacks. In this method, the dynamic threshold is updated according to the fusion value's upper and lower bounds, which are achieved by past observations of the fusion value.

Most previous methods projected 3D shapes from numerous viewpoints and then extracted features of 3D shapes from these projections and calculated the similarity with sketches. However, due to the unknown pose of 3D shapes, viewpoints were usually sampled uniformly from a sphere coordinate. Hence, some projections acquired insufficient descriptions of 3D shapes. In this paper, we proposed a view selection algorithm to find the most reasonable viewpoints, which can benefit representation learning for 3D shapes. Additionally, to indicate the apparent discrepancy between sketches and 3D shapes, we leveraged a generalized similarity model to encourage the accuracy of cross-domain feature matching. We first computed line renderings of 3D shapes from an enormous number of viewpoints. Then, we calculated the similarity of shapes between line renderings and sketches. In this vein, we obtained several superior projections. Second, we implemented a sketch network to extract features of the sketch and a shape network to extract features of projections. We combined the features of different projections to secure the compact representation for 3D shapes. Finally, a metric network was constructed using a cross-domain similarity model, and we trained the metric network with triplet loss.

Different from traditional signal acquisition processing methods, compressed sensing is a promising method being widely used in emerging areas such as image processing, biotechnology, and communication, etc. This method significantly reduces the sampling rate at signal acquisition, and the compressed signals can be recovered in an accurate way. Numerous studies illustrate that conventional compressed sensing is effectively used in the static system. However, the delay of the static system is very large, which restricts its application in highly real-time control applications. With the continuous expansion of smart grid, electric power department needs to adjust the price and other controllable variables in real-time to accommodate the electric consumption of residents. Increasing demand of real-time control strategy with fast, reliable and stable properties becomes the core issue that need to be solved urgently. Simulation results verify that the proposed strategy can recover signal in real-time effectively using less amount of data through a dynamic sliding window.","","978-1-5090-5418-3","10.1109/APPEEC.2016.7779795","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7779795","Real-time control;Compressed sensing (CS);Wireless sensor networks(WSNs);Sliding window;Kronecker sparsifying basis","Compressed sensing;Sparse matrices;Real-time systems;Smart grids;Wireless sensor networks;Correlation;Control systems","compressed sensing;power consumption;power system control;signal detection;signal sampling;smart power grids","compressed sensing based real-time control;smart grid;data transmission technique;signal acquisition processing method;sampling rate reduction;static system delay;electric consumption;signal recovery;dynamic sliding window","","","23","","12 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The design of lightweight and powerful detectors is in a great desire. Recently, group convolution, as a novel convolution algorithm, has been proposed to reduce the floating-point operations and make the detection network lighter and faster. However, in practice, it is found that the increase of group number does not always boost the detection speed, but sometimes leads to performance degradation. In addition, the existing guidelines for network design do not indicate how to choose the group number in the group convolution in order to maximize the overall detection speed. To this end, in this work, we propose three new guidelines to determine the valid range of the group number, and design a lightweight detection network -- DenseLightNet -- based on these new design criteria. The proposed detector runs at a speed of three times faster than the current real-time detector YoloV3, while holding a much smaller model size.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2019.2962413","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8948288","Autonomous Driving;Network Design;Automated Vehicle;Object Detection;Vehicle Detection","Convolution;Guidelines;Detectors;Design methodology;Feature extraction;Autonomous vehicles;Object detection","","","","","","","1 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In cloud native systems, autoscaling is a key enabling technique to adapt to workload changes by acquiring or releasing the right amount of computing resources. However, it becomes a challenging problem in microservice applications, since such an application usually comprises a large number of different microservices with complex interactions. When the performance decreases due to an unpredictable workload peak, it is difficult to pinpoint the scaling-needed services which need to scale out and evaluate how many resources they need. In this paper, we present a novel system named Microscaler to automatically identify the scaling-needed services and scale them to meet the Service Level Agreement (SLA) with an optimal cost for microservice applications. Microscaler first collects the quality of service (QoS) metrics in the service mesh enabled microservice infrastructure. Then, it determines under-provisioning or over-provisioning service instances along the service dependency graph with a novel scaling-needed service criterion named service power. The service dependency graph could be obtained by correlating each request flow in the service mesh. By combining an online learning approach and a step-by-step heuristic approach, Microscaler can precisely reach the optimal service scale meeting the SLA requirements. The experimental evaluations in a microservice benchmark show that Microscaler achieves an average 93% precision in scaling-needed service determination and converges to the optimal service scale faster than several state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, Microscaler is lightweight and flexible enough to work in a large-scale microservice system.","2168-7161","","10.1109/TCC.2020.2985352","Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams; National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Key R and D Program of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9057418","Auto-scaling;Microservice;Service Mesh;Bayesian Optimization;Cloud Computing","Cloud computing;Measurement;Computer architecture;Quality of service;Virtual machining;Benchmark testing;Bayes methods","","","","","","","6 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Our objective is to meet different quality of service (QoS) user demands while achieving higher energy efficiency and retaining reliable communications with low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). In our design, one input bit set is modulated by the index of the CI codes matrix whose rows are rotated circularly, another bit set is mapped to the MPSK symbols to realize the M-ary modulation. Subsequently, the resultant MPSK symbols are modulated by reference chaotic sequences and spread by the information-bearing rotated CI codes matrix at the transmitter. After the OFDM modulations, the information bearing symbols are transmitted over multiple subcarriers. At the receiver, after the non-coherent chaotic correlation demodulation, the maximum likelihood detection method is firstly applied to attain the estimates of the index modulated bit set, which are then used to recover the phases of chaotic sequences for further evaluation of another MPSK modulated symbols. Since no additional energy is required while more bits can be transmitted via the M-ary modulation and index modulation, the energy efficiency can be improved.

From the measurement of the electrical performance, the average power degradation and the median power degradation of the modules were 24.62% and 24.38%, respectively, or 1.56% per year in average. The reduction of power output is mainly attributed to the decrease of the fill factor. Through electroluminescence imaging, the degradation of the fill factor was found to be due to an increase in series resistance of the modules caused by solder bond failure and the corrosion of the Ag electrodes. From material analysis, scanning electron microscope inspection and analysis by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy showed the presence of acetate at the surface of the cells. The observation of needles in the silver metallization is a hint that corrosion of the metal occurred over time, probably caused by acetic acid, which can be a product of hydrolysis within ethylene vinyl acetate. It was found that the chemical reaction rate of acetate exhibits strong temperature dependence, following a typical Arrhenius-type dependence with temperature, which can result over long-time exposure in the field in corrosion of Ag metal fingers with predominance in the center of the cells operating at a higher temperature. Electron microscope imaging of cross section of cells also showed the presence of cracks between the ribbons and the Ag fingers, which can be caused by the large mismatch in coefficient of thermal expansion between the Si wafers and the Cu ribbons. Over time, the formation of intermetallic compounds in the solder layer may have made the solder more brittle and more susceptible to cracks.","2156-3403","","10.1109/JPHOTOV.2018.2819803","National High-tech R&D Program of China (863 Program); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8338398","Crack formation;corrosion;degradation analysis;photovoltaic (PV) modules;series resistance","Degradation;Meteorology;Silicon;Photovoltaic systems;Corrosion;Reliability","electroluminescence;elemental semiconductors;humidity;scanning electron microscopy;silicon;silver;solar cells;X-ray chemical analysis","higher temperature;electron microscope imaging;monocrystalline silicon photovoltaic modules;long-term exposure;hot-humid climate;degradation analysis;SM55;hot-humid climatic conditions;electrical performance;average power degradation;median power degradation;power output;fill factor;electroluminescence imaging;series resistance;solder bond failure;material analysis;electron microscope inspection;energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy;silver metallization;acetic acid;ethylene vinyl acetate;chemical reaction rate;typical Arrhenius-type dependence;long-time exposure;Ag metal fingers;Siemens solar company;time 18.0 year;size 500.0 m;Ag;Si;Cu","","3","32","","16 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To tackle these limitations, we propose a new model named Sentiment Convolutional Neural Network (SentiCNN) to analyze the sentiments of sentences with both contextual and sentiment information of sentiment words, in which, contextual information is captured from word embeddings and sentiment information is identified using existing lexicons. We incorporate a Highway Network into our model to adaptively combine sentiment and contextual information from sentences by strengthening the connection between features of both sentences and their sentiment words. Furthermore, we propose three lexicon-based attention mechanisms (LBAMs) for our SentiCNN model to find the most important indicators of sentiments and make predictions more effectively.

In this paper, the main goal is to evaluate the effect of large-scale utilization of electric vehicles (EV) on the total system loss. In this context, first the EVs' charging demand will be obtained using two probabilistic parameters: 1) expected driven distance, 2) expected duration of charging. The result is EV demand for 24 hours period which are added to the demand at load points. Eventually we solve the optimal power flow problem in each hour. We consider parking lots as demand aggregators to find the total charging demand at each hours based on single EV's electricity consumption. Afterwards, we investigate the effect of parking lots characteristics (charging rate, capacity in terms of number of EVs, and location in the power network) on the network's hourly loss and daily energy loss. To this end, we define four scenarios to determine the effect of charging rate and distribution of EVs over the network on the system loss. We also evaluate the effect of EV parking lot's location on the system loss.","2154-0373","978-1-4673-9985-2","10.1109/EIT.2016.7535291","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535291","Electric Vehicle Parking Lots;Power Systems Loss;Charging Demand;Smart Grid","Probabilistic logic;Electric vehicles;Smart grids;Energy loss;Load flow;Batteries","electric vehicles;power systems","EV distribution;power network;electricity consumption;optimal power flow problem;probabilistic parameters;electric vehicles;power systems loss;electric vehicle parking lots charging demand","","18","25","","8 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The continuous bounded inequality is converted into an equality by introducing a time-variant nonnegative vector. A continuous zeroing neural network (CZNN) model is proposed for solving the corresponding continuous DLLEBI by utilizing the ZNN method. Adams-Bashforth (AB) methods are combined with the CZNN model to improve the computational precision. Hence, AB discrete ZNN (AB-DZNN) models are proposed to solve future DLLEBI. Specifically, a four-step AB-DZNN model with high precision is proposed. Three-, two-, and one-step AB-DZNN models are also developed for comparative analyses. Theoretical analyses and numerical results substantiate the validity and superiority of the proposed four-step AB-DZNN model for solving future DLLEBI. In addition, motion control problems of three-link, mobile, and physical Kinova $\text{JACO}^2$ robot arms are formulated as three specific future DLLEBI problems. These problems can be solved by the four proposed AB-DZNN models.

Particularly, as a first attempt at solving this problem using visible light images, we assume a person only changes his/her clothes moderately when the weather doesn't change substantially within a short period so that the shape of a person would not change significantly. We perform cross-clothes person re-id based on a contour sketch of person image to take advantage of the shape of human body instead of color information. To select more discriminative curve patterns on a body contour sketch, we introduce a learning-based spatial polar transformation(SPT) layer in convolutional neural network(CNN) to transform contour sketch images into a polar coordinate space. An angle-specific extractor(ASE) is applied in the CNN to extract more fine-grained discriminant angle-specific features. Finally, we develop a multistream network for aggregating multi-granularity features. We also contribute a cross-clothes dataset consisting of 33698 images from 221 identities.

In conventional speaker verification, Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA) has been widely used as a supervised backend. However, PLDA requires fully labeled training data, which is often difficult to obtain in reality. To automatically retrieve the speaker labels of unlabeled training data, we propose to use the Affinity Propagation (AP) - a clustering method that takes pairwise data similarity as input - to generate the labels for the PLDA modeling. We further propose an iterative refinement strategy that incrementally updates the similarity input of the AP clustering with the previous iteration's PLDA scoring outputs. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of different PLDA scoring methods for the multiple enrollment task and show that the generalized hypothesis testing achieves the best results. Experiments were conducted on the NIST SRE 2010 and the 2014 i-vector challenge database. The results show that our proposed iterative and unsupervised PLDA model learning approach outperformed the cosine similarity baseline by 35% relatively.","","978-1-4799-4219-0","10.1109/ISCSLP.2014.6936726","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6936726","Speaker Verification;I-Vector;Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis;Affinity Propagation","NIST;Databases;Testing;Speaker recognition;Probabilistic logic;Data models;Vectors","iterative methods;pattern clustering;probability;speaker recognition;unsupervised learning","iterative refinement strategy;unsupervised learning;speaker verification;probabilistic linear discriminant analysis;affinity propagation;PLDA scoring method;pairwise data similarity;clustering method","","1","22","","27 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Student's t-tests were used to select the components displaying significant group difference for a more purposed analysis. Our findings revealed that the head part of the hippocampus in each hemisphere, to be specific the CA1 and subiculum subregions, contributed the most to the significant group differences. To further our analysis, we examined the classification accuracy yielded by these shape deformation patterns when either solely PCA or PCA followed by a Student's t-test was utilized as the approach to dimension reduction. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) were used as candidates for the classification technique.

It is proved that there is no local extremum for each local model. Experiments show that the new model is better adapted to nonlinear manifolds for various data distributions than other models in comparison. The online-learning property of this model makes it feasible for sequentially acquired data and large data sets.

However, few existing studies jointly consider the diverse impacts from various design criteria on the performance of HUE selection. In this paper, the sociality-aware D2D UE-NW relay selection (RS) issue is formulated as a constrained multi-objective binary integer linear programming (MOBILP) problem, which can be solved by the proposed SA-D2D-RS method. Specifically, the new solution jointly exploits the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) and the entropy weight generation method that provides both subjective and objective preferences in decision making.

This is achieved by using the fuzzy measure which integrates the partial evaluation of each objective with respect to the degree of consideration. The randomly chosen global best attracter is among the non-dominated particles selected, and has a relatively higher global evaluation value than the other particles. While updating the particles, the optimal inertia weight, cognitive acceleration and social acceleration constants are selected simultaneously based on user's preference.

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), as inherently parallel processing models for time-sequence processing, are potentially applicable for the motion control of manipulators. However, the development of neural models for high-accuracy and real-time control is a challenging problem. This paper identifies two limitations of the existing RNN solutions for manipulator control, i.e., position error accumulation and the convex restriction on the projection set, and overcomes them by proposing two modified neural network models. Our method allows nonconvex sets for projection operations, and control error does not accumulate over time in the presence of noise. Unlike most works in which RNNs are used to process time sequences, the proposed approach is model-based and training-free, which makes it possible to achieve fast tracking of reference signals with superior robustness and accuracy. Theoretical analysis reveals the global stability of a system under the control of the proposed neural networks. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control method in both the position regulation and tracking control of redundant PUMA 560 manipulators.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2574363","Hong Kong Research Grant Council (RGC) within the Early Career Scheme; Departmental General Research Fund within Hong Kong Polytechnic University; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Key Laboratory of Autonomous Systems and Networked Control within the Ministry of Education, China; Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7499812","Kinematic control;neural network;nonconvex set;recurrent neural networks (RNNs);redundant manipulator;robot arm","Manipulator dynamics;Kinematics;Mathematical model;Recurrent neural networks;Control systems","concave programming;convex programming;manipulator kinematics;motion control;neurocontrollers;position control;recurrent neural nets;set theory;stability","kinematic control;redundant PUMA 560 manipulators;recurrent neural networks;redundancy resolution;robotic manipulators;parallel processing models;time-sequence processing;motion control;position error accumulation;convex restriction;projection set;modified neural network models;nonconvex sets;projection operations;model-based;training-free;reference signal tracking;global stability;position regulation;position tracking control","","43","37","","24 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we make the first attempt to quantify the influence of intermittent connectivity on mobile edge computing from a theoretical perspective. Specifically, we propose an analytical framework based on discrete-time Markov chain and derive a closed-form expression of the task processing time under different network conditions. Our model can be further extended to account for the case with group task arrivals. We also conduct extensive simulations to examine the accuracy of our proposed analytical models with both synthetic and real-world user mobility traces. The results show that our model can well capture the influence of intermittent connectivity on MEC.

Many models for matrix inversion usually assume that the solving process is free of noises or that the denoising has been conducted before the computation. However, time is precious for the real-time-varying matrix inversion in practice, and any preprocessing for noise reduction may consume extra time, possibly violating the requirement of real-time computation. Therefore, a new model for time-varying matrix inversion that is able to handle simultaneously the noises is urgently needed. In this paper, an integration-enhanced Zhang neural network (IEZNN) model is first proposed and investigated for real-time-varying matrix inversion. Then, the conventional ZNN model and the gradient neural network model are presented and employed for comparison. In addition, theoretical analyses show that the proposed IEZNN model has the global exponential convergence property. Moreover, in the presence of various kinds of noises, the proposed IEZNN model is proven to have an improved performance. That is, the proposed IEZNN model converges to the theoretical solution of the time-varying matrix inversion problem no matter how large the matrix-form constant noise is, and the residual errors of the proposed IEZNN model can be arbitrarily small for time-varying noises and random noises. Finally, three illustrative simulation examples, including an application to the inverse kinematic motion planning of a robot manipulator, are provided and analyzed to substantiate the efficacy and superiority of the proposed IEZNN model for real-time-varying matrix inversion.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2497715","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Foundation of Key Laboratory of Autonomous Systems and Networked Control through the Ministry of Education, China; Science and Technology Program, Guangzhou, China; Hong Kong Research Grants Council Early Career Scheme; Departmental General Research Fund, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7335635","Integration-enhanced Zhang neural network (IEZNN);random noise;real-time-varying matrix inversion;residual error;theoretical analysis","Computational modeling;Real-time systems;Analytical models;Neural networks;Convergence;Matrix converters;Noise reduction","matrix inversion;neurocontrollers;random noise;time-varying systems","integration-enhanced Zhang neural network;IEZNN model;time-varying matrix inversion;noise reduction","","94","37","","23 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on the investigation of an ideal model, the design requirements to achieve the previous reconfigurability can be obtained. Thus the coupled line loaded with varactor is proposed on a patch coupler to implement the desired functionality. By varying the voltages applied on the varactors, the frequency and coupling coefficient at the lower band of the proposed coupler can be tuned independently with the characteristics at the upper band fixed. For validation, a prototype was designed, fabricated and measured. Measured results show that the frequency of the coupler at the lower band can be tuned from 2.9 to 3.2 GHz. Meanwhile, the corresponding coupling coefficient can be tuned from 3 dB to 10 dB. During the lower band tuning, 3 dB coupling coefficient and quadrature phase difference can be always maintained for upper band which is fixed at 4.7 GHz.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2020.2975459","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9014554","Dual-band;quadrature coupler;independently tunable;tunable frequency;tunable coupling coefficient;varactor","Couplers;Couplings;Dual band;Varactors;Wireless communication;Frequency measurement;Tuning","","","","","","","26 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, such a straightforward CSK-OOFDM combination distorts the colour balance and the modulated VLC signal is therefore no longer white. In this paper, we design optimised CSK constellations that work in the complex domain under a given colour constraint. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the new design method, which not only produces new constellations with an improved normalised minimum Euclidean distance (NMED) compared with the traditional counterparts, hence improves the achievable bit error rate (BER) performance, but also eliminates the colour balance distortion issue of conventional CSK-OOFDM systems.","2577-2465","978-1-5386-6358-5","10.1109/VTCFall.2018.8691040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8691040","Colour shift keying (CSK);complex colour shift keying (CCSK);optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OOFDM);visible light communication (VLC)","Image color analysis;Visible light communication;Modulation;Optical distortion;Color;Light emitting diodes;Adaptive optics","error statistics;free-space optical communication;OFDM modulation;optical modulation","conventional CSK-OOFDM systems;optical OFDM systems;visible light communication;modulated VLC signal;bit error rate;optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;IEEE 802.15.7 standard;CSK constellations;CSK-OOFDM;high-rate transmission technologies;colour shift keying;colour balance distortion;normalised minimum Euclidean distance","","","14","","14 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed distributed control algorithm only depends on information exchange among neighboring controllers. Therefore, it can be implemented without introducing an extra central controller and it exploits the sparse communication network efficiently and enhances the adaptivity and reliability.

A group of subjects (either ASD or non-ASD) are shown with a set of aligned human face images, with eye gaze locations on each image recorded sequentially.

The main problems of NIR-VIS Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR) tasks include two aspects: large intra-class differences caused by cross-modal data, and insufficient paired training samples. In this paper, an effective Adversarial Disentanglement spectrum variations and Cross-modality Attention Networks (ADCANs) is proposed for VIS-NIR matching task. Three key components are introduced to the ADCANs for reducing the gap of cross-modal images: Advanced Scatter Loss (ASL), Modality-adversarial Feature Learning (MaFL) and Cross-modality Attention Block (CmAB). The proposed ASL loss captures between- and within-class information of the data and embeds them to the network for more effective training, and it focuses on categories with small between-class distance and increases the distance between them. The MaFL consists of an Identity-Discriminative Feature Learning Network (IDFLN) and a Modality-Adversarial Disentanglement Network (MADN), which can enhance the identity-discriminative feature representations as well as disentangling spectrum variations via an adversarial learning. The IDFLN built by an end-to-end CNNs aims at learning identity-discriminative feature. While the MADN built by a discriminator D and a generator G focuses on removing modality-related information. Furthermore, to increase representation power as well as disentangling spectrum variations effectively, a CmAB block is introduced to the network, which sequentially applies spatial and channel attention modules to both the IDFLN and MADN. Since the channel attention module focuses on 'what' features to suppress or emphasize, an orthogonality constraint is introduced to the two channel attention modules, which allows MADN and IDFLN to focus on learning modality-related features and identity-related features, respectively. In particular, the ADCANs consists of multiple CmAB blocks to learn discriminative features and disentangle spectrum variations. A large number of experiments on three challenging HFR datasets indicate that the proposed ADCANs is effective for VIS-NIR HFR task.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2020.2980201","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9037066","NIR-VIS HFR task;Deep learning;Advanced Scatter Loss;Modality-adversarial Feature Learning;Cross-modality Attention Block","Task analysis;Feature extraction;Face;Training;Face recognition;Visualization;Deep learning","","","","","","","16 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

LR DCLC is an approximate algorithm based on Lagrange relaxation for the DCLC problem, but such approximate algorithm cannot find the optimal path. In this paper, an exact dynamic programming algorithm DP DCLC for DCLC path is proposed, which can efficiently reduce the time complexity of BSMA and can meet the QoS routing requirements. We compare the DP DCLC's performance with KSP and LR DCLC algorithms through the random graph model (RGM) in C++ code.

As a conventional solution, the Jacobian-matrix-pseudo-inverse (JMPI) method suffers from two major limitations: one is the requirement on known information of the robot model such as parameter and structure; the other is the position error accumulation phenomenon caused by the open-loop nature. To overcome such two limitations, this paper proposes a novel Jacobian-matrix-adaption (JMA) method for the tracking control of robot manipulators via the zeroing dynamics. Unlike existing works requiring the information of the known robot model, the proposed JMA method uses only the input-output information to control the robot with unknown model. The solution based on the JMA method transforms the internal, implicit, and unmeasurable model information to the external, explicit, and measurable input-output information. Moreover, simulation studies including comparisons and tests substantiate the efficacy and superiority of the proposed JMA method for the tracking control of robot manipulators subject to unknown models.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2017.2766455","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China; Hong Kong Research Grants Council Early Career Scheme; Departmental General Research Fund of Hong Kong Polytechnic University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8082558","Input-output information;Jacobian-matrix-adaption (JMA);robot manipulators;unknown models;zeroing dynamics","Protocols;Path planning;Complexity theory;Power system dynamics;Vehicle dynamics;Shortest path problem","adaptive control;control system synthesis;feedback;iterative methods;Jacobian matrices;manipulators;nonlinear control systems;position control","tracking control;robot manipulators;unknown model;robotic industry;known robot model;JMA method;internal model information;unmeasurable model information;external input-output information;measurable input-output information;Jacobian-matrix-pseudoinverse method;Jacobian-matrix-adaption method;implicit model information;explicit input-output information","","25","54","","25 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the second phase (i.e., “region colabeling�?), we construct a multiimage graphical model by taking the segmented regions as vertices, and incorporating several contexts of clothing configuration (e.g., item locations and mutual interactions). The joint label assignment can be solved using the efficient Graph Cuts algorithm.

We propose a deep architecture consisting of two networks: i) a convolutional neural network (CNN) extracting the image representation for pixel-wise object labeling and ii) a recursive neural network (RsNN) discovering the hierarchical object structure and the inter-object relations. Rather than relying on elaborative annotations (e.g., manually labeled semantic maps and relations), we train our deep model in a weakly-supervised learning manner by leveraging the descriptive sentences of the training images. Specifically, we decompose each sentence into a semantic tree consisting of nouns and verb phrases, and apply these tree structures to discover the configurations of the training images. Once these scene configurations are determined, then the parameters of both the CNN and RsNN are updated accordingly by back propagation. The entire model training is accomplished through an Expectation-Maximization method. Extensive experiments show that our model is capable of producing meaningful scene configurations and achieving more favorable scene labeling results on two benchmarks (i.e., PASCAL VOC 2012 and SYSU-Scenes) compared with other state-of-the-art weakly-supervised deep learning methods.

We develop the blocking artifact characteristics matrix (BACM) and show that, for the original JPEG images, the BACM exhibits regular symmetrical shape; for images that are cropped from another JPEG image and re-saved as JPEG images, the regular symmetrical property of the BACM is destroyed. We fully exploit this property of the BACM and derive representation features from the BACM to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for recognizing whether an image is an original JPEG image or it has been cropped from another JPEG image and re-saved as a JPEG image.

Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) has been demonstrated to be an effective device in data acquisition of forest plots. Although TLS is able to achieve precise measurements, multiple scans are usually necessary to collect more detailed data, which generally requires more time in scan preparation and field data acquisition. In contrast, mobile laser scanning (MLS) is being increasingly utilized in mapping due to its mobility. However, the geometrical peculiarity of forests introduces challenges. In this article, a test backpack-based MLS system, i.e., backpack laser scanning (BLS), is designed for forest plot mapping without a global navigation satellite system/inertial measurement unit (GNSS-IMU) system. To achieve accurate matching, this article proposes to combine the line and point features for calculating transformation, in which the line feature is derived from trunk skeletons. Then, a scan-to-map matching strategy is proposed for correcting positional drift. Finally, this article evaluates the effectiveness and the mapping accuracy of the proposed method in forest sample plots. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves accurate forest plot mapping using the BLS; meanwhile, compared to the existing methods, the proposed method utilizes the geometric attributes of the trees and reaches a lower mapping error, in which the mean errors and the root square mean errors for the horizontal/vertical direction in plots are less than 3 cm.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2020.2999413","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Guangxi Natural Science Fund for Innovation Research Team; Open Fund of State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9118969","Backpack laser scanning (BLS);forest plot;mobile mapping;point cloud;simultaneous localization;and mapping (SLAM).","Forestry;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Feature extraction;Vegetation;Three-dimensional displays;Measurement by laser beam;Remote sensing","","","","","","","16 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The proposed deep cascaded neural network consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and three long short-term memory (LSTM) units, fed with images from a front-facing camera installed at the vehicle. As the outputs, the proposed model can predict thee motion planning commands simultaneously including steering angle, acceleration, and brake to enable the autonomous driving. In order to balance errors among different motion commands and improve prediction accuracy, we propose a new network training algorithm, where three independent loss functions are designed to separately update the weights in the three LSTMs connected to three motion commands.

However, solving such a high-dimensional optimization problem often requires a large number of training samples in order to avoid overfitting. In addition, it is a typical nonconvex problem affected by many local minima and flat regions. To address these problems, in this article, we introduce the naive Gabor networks or Gabor-Nets that, for the first time in the literature, design and learn CNN kernels strictly in the form of Gabor filters, aiming to reduce the number of involved parameters and constrain the solution space and, hence, improve the performances of CNNs. Specifically, we develop an innovative phase-induced Gabor kernel, which is trickily designed to perform the Gabor feature learning via a linear combination of local low-frequency and high-frequency components of data controlled by the kernel phase. With the phase-induced Gabor kernel, the proposed Gabor-Nets gains the ability to automatically adapt to the local harmonic characteristics of the HSI data and, thus, yields more representative harmonic features. Also, this kernel can fulfill the traditional complex-valued Gabor filtering in a real-valued manner, hence making Gabor-Nets easily perform in a usual CNN thread. We evaluated our newly developed Gabor-Nets on three well-known HSIs, suggesting that our proposed Gabor-Nets can significantly improve the performance of CNNs, particularly with a small training set.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2020.2978760","National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9046246","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs);hyperspectral images (HSIs);naive Gabor networks (Gabor-Nets).","Kernel;Feature extraction;Harmonic analysis;Training;Hyperspectral imaging;Convolution;Solid modeling","","","","","","","24 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Previous UDA methods assume that the source and target domains share an identical label space, which is unrealistic in practice since the label information of the target domain is agnostic. This article focuses on a more realistic UDA scenario, i.e., partial domain adaptation (PDA), where the target label space is subsumed to the source label space. In the PDA scenario, the source outliers that are absent in the target domain may be wrongly matched to the target domain (technically named negative transfer), leading to performance degradation of UDA methods. This article proposes a novel target-domain-specific classifier learning-based domain adaptation (TSCDA) method. TSCDA presents a soft-weighed maximum mean discrepancy criterion to partially align feature distributions and alleviate negative transfer. Also, it learns a target-specific classifier for the target domain with pseudolabels and multiple auxiliary classifiers to further address the classifier shift. A module named peers-assisted learning is used to minimize the prediction difference between multiple target-specific classifiers, which makes the classifiers more discriminant for the target domain. Extensive experiments conducted on three PDA benchmark data sets show that TSCDA outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with a large margin, e.g., 4% and 5.6% averagely on Office-31 and Office-Home, respectively.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2020.2995648","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9108582","Classifier shift;consistency regularization;distribution gap;maximum mean discrepancy (MMD);partial domain adaptation (PDA).","Handheld computers;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Learning systems;Degradation;Adaptation models;Training","","","","","","","4 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Traditional velocity obstacle methods do not fully consider the obstacles moving with the speeds larger than the maximum speed of the robot. In this paper, a new obstacle avoidance method, named the maximum-speed aware velocity obstacle (MVO) algorithm, is proposed for a mobile robot to avoid one or multiple high-speed obstacles. The proposed algorithm expands the velocity obstacle region into two parts, where one of the parts foresees collisions beyond the time horizon to ensure the feasible solutions of the current and the next control step. In practical applications, the perception capability of the robot is generally limited, and a non-holonomic robot can’t move into any direction due to its kinematic constraints. In this paper, the limited sensing field of view and non-holonomic kinematic constraints of the mobile robot are incorporated into the proposed MVO method. Moreover, continuity, safety, and computational complexity of the MVO approach are analyzed and presented. Extensive simulations and physical experiments are conducted to verify the efficacy of the MVO method, where a quadrotor and a differential-drive robot are used to perform dynamic obstacle avoidance.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3012513","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province; NSFCShenzhen Robotics Projects; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9151148","Motion planning;Collision avoidance;High-speed obstacles;Limited field of view;Kinematic constraints","Collision avoidance;Robot sensing systems;Heuristic algorithms;Kinematics;Path planning;Mobile robots","","","","","","CCBY","28 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

For this reason, glaciologists rarely have opportunities to document its developments in detail. Satellite observations are too coarse to capture such fine features, whereas Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technologies have revolutionized geosciences research, especially in less accessed polar regions. We developed two bespoke UAV systems for glaciological investigation and carried out four campaigns during two consecutive Chinese Antarctic expeditions in 2017 and 2018. Founded on manual co-registration and accuracy assessment, a successful application to characterize a doline's spatio-temporal evolution is presented in this paper. The overlying weight of surface melting directly triggered the collapse event on 30 Jan 2017 near the Dalk Glacier, then the newborn doline grew for another 8135.6 m2 in area and 280303.38 m3 in volume by early 2018. The UAV-based results revealed the doline's changes during a year, showing a maximum horizontal extension of 50 m and vertical subsidence of more than 10 m. Furthermore, we evaluate the photogrammetry and LiDAR systems and find the former is cost-effective and time-efficient on a large-scale survey while the latter enjoys a better capability to characterize morphological details. Based on systematic comparisons, other pros and cons of the two techniques are discussed. To achieve the best performance for applications in similar scenarios, we recommend adopting an integrated approach, in which LiDAR restores the fine features on the basis of extensive SfM coverage.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2020.3010069","Chinese Polar Environment Comprehensive Investigation and Assessment Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China; UK-China Joint Research and Innovation Partnership Fund PhD Placement Program; UK NERC SHEAR projec; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9143440","Antarctica;Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV);Ice Doline;Change Detection;Digital Elevation Model (DEM);Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR);Structure-from-Motion (SfM)","Ice;Laser radar;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Morphology;Antarctica;Feature extraction;Satellites","","","","","","CCBY","17 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Then the watermark is generated by quantizing ZMMs and embedded into the image. The authentication doesn't need the original watermark. The decision depends on the distance between the extracted watermark and the feature vector of the test image and a metric measure. To decrease the influence of watermarking on the feature vector, we split the binary image into two parts by a random mask, one for generating feature vector and the other for embedding watermark. Zernike moments are usually computationally expensive, so we propose a fast algorithm. Extensive experiments show that our scheme can detect malicious attacks effectively.","2381-8549","978-1-4244-1436-9","10.1109/ICIP.2007.4378972","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4378972","binary image authentication;Zernike moments;watermark;feature vector","Authentication;Watermarking;Polynomials;Sun;Testing;Pixel;Distortion measurement;Data security;Appraisal;Feature extraction","message authentication;watermarking","binary image authentication;Zernike moments magnitudes;feature vector watermarking;binary image","","4","11","","12 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When a user moves erratically among multiple MEC nodes, the challenge of how to dynamically migrate its service to maintain service performance (i.e., user-perceived latency) arises. However, frequent service migration can significantly increase operational cost, incurring the conflict between improving performance and reducing cost. To address these mis-aligned objectives, this paper studies the performance optimization of mobile edge service placement under the constraint of long-term cost budget. It is challenging because the budget involves the future uncertain information (e.g., user mobility). To overcome this difficulty, we devote to leveraging the power of prediction and advocate predictive service placement with predicted nearfuture information. By using two-timescale Lyapunov optimization method, we propose a T-slot predictive service placement (PSP) algorithm to incorporate the prediction of user mobility based on a frame-based design. We characterize the performance bounds of PSP in terms of cost-delay trade-off theoretically. Furthermore, we propose a new weight adjustment scheme for the queue in each frame named PSP-WU to exploit the historical queue information, which greatly reduces the length of queue while improving the quality of user-perceived latency. Rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive evaluations using realistic data traces demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed predictive schemes.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2020.3003459","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9126201","Mobile edge computing;Predictive service placement;Two-timescale Lyapunov optimization","","","","","","","","25 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Second, to ensure financial stability in the blockchain-enabled market and to match the difficulty of the received tasks with the ability of the workers, we design a dynamic, hierarchical pricing mechanism based on economic modeling methods and heterogeneous agent theory. With this mechanism, the market is divided dynamically into multiple levels according to the remuneration the customers offer and the market value of the workers�? resources. Additional constraints are proposed to avoid possible malicious trading behavior from workers in the resource lending process. We prove theoretically the rationality of our model and demonstrate the dynamics of the model. We show that the market price and demand can be convergent and test the cost of executing the two smart contracts.

Especially, how to coordinate the traffic light controllers of multiple intersections is a key challenge for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Most existing MARL studies are based on traditional Q-learning, but unstable environment leads to poor learning in the complicated and dynamic traffic scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent recurrent deep deterministic policy gradient (MARDDPG) algorithm based on Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm for traffic light control (TLC) in vehiclar networks. Specifically, the centralized learning in each critic network enables each agent to estimate the policies of other agents in the decision-making process and each agent can coordinate with each other, alleviating the problem of poor learning performance caused by environmental instability. The decentralized execution enables each agent to make decisions independently. We share parameter in actor networks to speed up training process and reduce the memory footprint. The addition of LSTM is beneficial to alleviate the instability of the environment caused by partial observable state. We utilize surveillance cameras and vehicular networks to collect status information for each intersection. Unlike previous work, we have not only considered the vehicle but also considered the pedestrians waiting to pass through the intersection. Moreover, we also set different priorities for buses and ordinary vehicles. The experimental results in a vehicular network show that our method can run stably in various scenarios and coordinate multiple intersections, which significantly reduces vehicle congestion and pedestrian congestion.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2020.2997896","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9103316","Traffic Light Control;Deep Reinforcement Learning;Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithm;Markov Decision Process;Vehicular Network","Reinforcement learning;Heuristic algorithms;Computer science;Vehicle dynamics;Training;Process control;Internet of Things","","","","","","","28 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Our objective is to provide a general framework to report more reliable sensing results to improve the sensing precision and reduce the collision probability with the low complexity. To this end, the soft sensing decisions are quantized to multiple levels, then they are compressed and encoded, while the characteristic information of secondary users (SUs) including the index of the SUs, the interference tolerance level etc, is transmitted over equivalent bit channels. Furthermore, considering that different users may have different quality of service requirements, we propose four methods to allow SUs to deliver local sensing results with different precisions.

In our proposed method, we get an image by combining the least two significant bit-planes and divide it into 3x3 overlapped subimages. The subimages are grouped into four types, i.e. T 1,T 2, T 3 and T 4 according to the count of gray levels. Via embedding a random sequence by LSB matching and then computing the alteration rate of the number of elements in T 1, we find that normally the alteration rate is higher in cover image than in the corresponding stego image.

Its key challenge lies in how to integrate diverse factors (such as temporal rules and spatial dependencies) to infer the evolution trend of traffic flow. To address this problem, we propose a unified neural network called Attentive Traffic Flow Machine (ATFM), which can effectively learn the spatial-temporal feature representations of traffic flow with an attention mechanism. In particular, our ATFM is composed of two progressive Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM [1]) units connected with a convolutional layer. Specifically, the first ConvLSTM unit takes normal traffic flow features as input and generates a hidden state at each time-step, which is further fed into the connected convolutional layer for spatial attention map inference. The second ConvLSTM unit aims at learning the dynamic spatial-temporal representations from the attentionally weighted traffic flow features. Further, we develop two deep learning frameworks based on ATFM to predict citywide short-term/long-term traffic flow by adaptively incorporating the sequential and periodic data as well as other external influences. Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks well demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method for traffic flow prediction. Moreover, to verify the generalization of our method, we also apply the customized framework to forecast the passenger pickup/dropoff demands in traffic prediction and show its superior performance.

Therefore, it is urgent for remote-sensing scientists to develop new techniques for PolSAR image classification under the condition of very few training samples. In this letter, we take the advantage of active learning and propose active ensemble deep learning (AEDL) for PolSAR image classification. We first show that only 35% of the predicted labels of the deep-learning model's snapshots near its convergence were exactly the same. The disagreement between the snapshots is nonnegligible. From the perspective of multiview learning, the snapshots together serve as a good committee to evaluate the importance of the unlabeled instances. Using the snapshot committee to give out the informativeness of the unlabeled data, the proposed AEDL achieved better performance on two real PolSAR images than the standard active learning strategies.

In this article, we show that robust statistics implemented by the state-of-the-art methods are insufficient for robustness against dense gross errors. By modeling the distribution of coding residuals with a Laplacian-uniform mixture, we obtain a sparse representation that is significantly more robust than the previous methods. The nonconvex error term of the implemented objective function is nondifferentiable at zero and cannot be properly addressed by the usual iteratively reweighted least-squares formulation. We show that an iterative robust coding algorithm can be derived by local linear approximation of the nonconvex error term, which is both effective and efficient. With iteratively reweighted l�? minimization of the error term, the proposed algorithm is capable of handling the sparsity assumption of the coding errors more appropriately than the previous methods. Notably, it has the distinct property of addressing error detection and error correction cooperatively in the robust coding process.

An important research problem related with scRNA-seq data analysis is to identify cell subpopulations with distinct functions. However, the expression profiles of individual cells are usually measured over tens of thousands of genes, and it remains a difficult problem to effectively cluster the cells based on the high-dimensional profiles. An additional challenge of performing the analysis is that, the scRNA-seq data are often noisy and sometimes extremely sparse due to technical limitations and sampling deficiencies. In this paper, we propose a biclustering-based framework called DivBiclust that effectively identifies the cell subpopulations based on the high-dimensional noisy scRNA-seq data. Compared with nine state-of-the-art methods, DivBiclust excels in identifying cell subpopulations with high accuracy as evidenced by our experiments on ten real scRNA-seq datasets with different size and diverse dropout rates.

To enhance the adhesion of AgNWs to substrate, the patterned AgNWs were embedded into epoxy resin (EPR) by a facile transferring process. The key to this process is the anti-adhesive groups (CH3) grafted on the oxidized PDMS to assist a clean exfoliation.

Artificial test problems are critical to the progress in this research area. Nevertheless, many of them lack important characteristics such as scalability and variable dependencies, which may be essential in benchmarking modern evolutionary algorithms. This paper firstly proposes a new framework for constrained test problem construction. This framework splits a decision vector into position and distance variables, and forces their optimal values to lie on a non-linear hypersurface such that the inter-dependencies can be introduced among the position ones and among the distance ones individually. In this framework, two kinds of constraints are designed to introduce convergence-hardness and diversity-hardness respectively. The first kind introduces infeasible barriers in approaching the optima, and at the same time, makes the position and distance variables inter-relate with each other. The second kind restricts the feasible optimal regions such that different shapes of Pareto fronts can be obtained. Based on this framework, we construct 16 scalable and constrained test problems covering a variety of difficulties. Then, in the second part of this paper, we evaluate the performance of some state of the art on the proposed test problems, showing that they are quite challenging and there is room for further enhancement of existing algorithms. Finally, we discuss in detail the source of difficulties presented in these new problems.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2020.3011829","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9149679","Constraint optimization;multi-/many-objective optimization;evolutionary algorithms;local search.","Optimization;Evolutionary computation;Shape;Maintenance engineering;Performance evaluation;Benchmark testing;Convergence","","","","","","","27 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In some applications, an AUV can be tethered by a communication cable, such as an optical fiber, for real-time surveillance. This article focuses on the motion analysis of the AUV and cable coupling system to investigate the interaction between AUV and cable dynamic behaviors, especially under the current disturbance in the dynamic ocean environment. The dynamic equations of the coupled AUV and cable are derived using the well-known finite difference method and solved using the advanced trust-region method in MATLAB. The model-based simulation scheme is presented and further verified by comparing the simulation results with the validated ones published in the existing literature. The motion cases when the tethered vehicle maneuvers in a variety of motion modes and current scenarios are studied to conduct a systematic motion analysis. Both the variation in the cable tension at the towpoint and the configuration of the cable in the water are investigated. Based on the understanding of the cable and current effects on AUV motion, this article further explores the antitwining maneuvering strategy for the cable-tethered AUV moving in currents. The findings in this work can provide theoretical guidance for the safe operation of the AUV and cable coupling system in the field.","1558-1691","","10.1109/JOE.2020.2986876","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9109351","Antitwining maneuvering strategy;autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs);cable dynamics;finite difference method (FDM);ocean current effects","Mathematical model;Underwater cables;Optical fiber cables;Vehicle dynamics;Dynamics;Oceans;Real-time systems","","","","","","","5 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, the driving range of EVs is inevitably affected by the insufficient battery volume, as such EV drivers may experience trip discomfort due to a long battery charging time (under traditional plug-in charging service). One feasible alternative to accelerate the service time to feed electricity is the battery switch technology, by cycling switchable (fully-recharged) batteries at Battery Switch Stations (BSSs) to replace the depleted batteries from incoming EVs. Along with recent advance of vehicle cooperation through emerging Information Communication Technology (ICT), in this paper we propose a Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) driven architecture to gear the intelligent battery switch service management for EVs. Here, the decision making on where to switch battery is operated by EVs in a distributed manner. Besides, the Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication in line with public transportation bus system is applied to operate flexible information exchange between EVs and BSSs. Dedicated MEC functions are positioned for bus system to efficiently disseminate BSSs status and aggregate EVs' reservations, concerning the massive signalling exchange cost. The Global Controller (GC) is positioned as cloud server to gather BSSs (service providers) status and EVs' reservations (clients), and predict the service availability of BSS (e.g., whether/when a battery can be switched). We conduct performance evaluation to show the advantage of MEC system in terms of reduction of communication cost, and BSS service management scheme regarding reduction of service waiting time (e.g., how long to wait for battery switch) and increase of service satisfaction rate (e.g., how many batteries to switch for EVs).","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2020.3004117","Joint Fund of Guangdong Province Foundation and Applied Science; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9142422","Electric Vehicle;transportation management;V2V communication;mobile edge computing.","Batteries;Switches;Optimization;Urban areas;Charging stations;Edge computing;Vehicular ad hoc networks","","","","","","","16 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Thus, a distributed proportional integral method combined with a finite-time observer to estimate the global reference information is presented in the frequency restoration while maintaining accurate active power sharing. Our approach accommodates model uncertainty, plug-and-play capability, and especially robustness against information update intervals, which is essential when the conventional method probably yields towards a poor performance.

For the practical application-oriented measurement of auditory localization ability, the preference is a compromise among (i) data accuracy, (ii) the maneuverability of collecting directions, and (iii) the cost of hardware and software. The graphical user interface (GUI)-based sound-localization experimental platform proposed here (i) is cheap, (ii) can be operated autonomously by the listener, (iii) can store results online, and (iv) supports real or virtual sound sources. To evaluate the accuracy of this method, by using 12 loudspeakers arranged in equal azimuthal intervals of 30 in the horizontal plane, three groups of azimuthal localization experiments are conducted in the horizontal plane with subjects with normal hearing. In these experiments, the azimuths are reported using (i) an assistant, (ii) a motion tracker, or (iii) the newly designed GUI-based method. All three groups of results show that the localization errors are mostly within 512, which is consistent with previous results from different localization experiments. Finally, the stimulus of virtual sound sources is integrated into the GUI-based experimental platform.

In this technique, a 2D-JSR signal model is established, enabling the 2-D high-resolution ISAR image to be generated by solving a sparsity-driven optimization problem with a modified quasi-Newton solver. In addition, a new JMCAS algorithm is developed to enhance the focusing performance of image. Not only can this algorithm jointly correct the range shift and phase error caused by translational motion, it can also complete the azimuth scaling and range spatial-variant phase error (RSVPE) compensation simultaneously.

A restrictive blind signature scheme is a protocol that allows a signature requester to obtain a blind signature on a message from a signer, but the choice of message is restricted and must conform to certain rules.

In this paper, we present a novel deep architecture, termed as Bifurcated Convolutional Neural Network (BifurcatedNet) to learn the discriminative video representation in an end-to-end manner. In our work, the BifurcatedNet is built upon the stacking bifurcated blocks that aim at simultaneously capturing the static appearance information and the temporal dynamic from input data. Specifically, the bifurcated block is composed of two separated branch, i.e., an appearance branch and a dynamic branch. The appearance branch employs 2D convolutional operation to obtain the spatial responses of image pixels or filters of each input frame, while the design of the dynamic branch is based on the spatio-temporal convolutional operation to exploit the temporal dynamic between pixels and filter response across multiple frames. Multiple experiments are conducted on two popular action recognition benchmarks: UCF101 and HMDB51. With only RGB input, the BifurcatedNet obtains the superior performance over the existing state-of-the-art models under the same experimental setting. The proposed BifurcatedNet is also implemented in a two-stream fashion by using both RGB and optical flow input, and still achieves the state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of the network design. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the generalization ability, we conduct experiments on the Chalearn LAP IsoGD dataset and find that our model works well in gesture recognition tasks.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2020.3006223","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9130776","Action recognition;BifurcatedNet;Video classification;Deep learning;Convolutional neural network","","","","","","","","1 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this paper, we investigate the reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) problem associated with dual-camera or multi-camera systems, with a significant resolution gap (8x) and large parallax (10%pixel displacement). We present CrossNet++, an end-to-end network containing novel two-stage cross-scale warping modules. The stage I learns to narrow down the parallax distinctively with the strong guidance of landmarks and intensity distribution consensus. Then the stage II operates more fine-grained alignment and aggregation in feature domain to synthesize the final super-resolved image. To further address the large parallax, new hybrid loss functions comprising warping loss, landmark loss and super-resolution loss are proposed to regularize training and enable better convergence. CrossNet++ significantly outperforms the state-of-art on light field datasets as well as real dual-camera data.

In this paper, we study the implementation of time-dependent pricing (TDP) for bandwidth slicing in software-defined cellular networks under information asymmetry and price discrimination. Congestion prices indicating real-time congestion levels of different links are used as a signal to motivate delay-tolerant users to defer their traffic demands. We formulate the joint pricing and bandwidth demand optimization problem as a two-stage Stackelberg leader-follower game. Then, we investigate how to derive the optimal solutions under the scenarios of both complete and incomplete information. We also extend the results from the simplified case of a single congested link to the more complicated case of multiple congested links, where price discrimination is employed to dynamically adjust the price of each congested link in accordance with its real-time congestion level.

In this paper, we define a new chi-square statistic which is used to measure whether the image under scrutiny is like the cover or the stego. Our proposed steganalytic method is based on the symmetry property of the DCT coefficients in JPEG images. It can also be used in the scenario where the cover images are double JPEG compressed. The reliability of this specific steganalytic scheme depends on the embedding rate and it is influenced by the JPEG quality factor.

Different from previous works that applied one convolutional neural network (ConvNet) for each part/joint separately, one pair of structured DIs is constructed from depth maps at each granularity level and serves as the input of a ConvNet. The structured DI not only preserves the spatial-temporal information but also enhances the structure information across both body parts/joints and different temporal scales. In additionally, it requires low computational cost and memory to construct. This new representation, referred to as Spatially and Temporally Structured Dynamic Depth Images, aggregates from global to fine-grained levels motion and structure information in a depth sequence, and enables us to fine-tune the existing ConvNet models trained on image data for classification of depth sequences, without a need for training the models afresh.

In this paper, we investigate the unique features of the head-shoulder and full body features belonging to pedestrians. Then, instead of using a popular general object detection framework like R-CNN series, SSD, or YOLO, we propose a novel pedestrian detection network, called PedJointNet, that simultaneously regresses two bounding boxes to localize the head-shoulder and full body regions based on a feasible object detection backbone. Moreover, unlike the traditional strategy of keeping the weights fixed for each attribute, we design an inbuilt mechanism to dynamically and adaptively adjust the relationships of the head-shoulder and full body predictions for more accurate pedestrian localization. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method using the CUHK-SYSU, TownCentre, and CityPersons datasets.

In this paper, we propose a novel person re-identification method, which consists of a reliable representation called semantic region representation (SRR), and an effective metric learning with mapping space topology constraint (MSTC). The SRR integrates semantic representations to achieve effective similarity comparison between the corresponding regions via parsing the body into multiple parts, which focuses on the foreground context against the background interference. To learn a discriminant metric, the MSTC is proposed to consider the topological relationship among all samples in the feature space. It considers two-fold constraints: the distribution of positive pairs should be more compact than the average distribution of negative pairs with regard to the same probe, while the average distance between different classes should be larger than that between same classes. These two aspects cooperate to maintain the compactness of the intra-class as well as the sparsity of the inter-class.

To overcome this challenge, we propose a deep neural network-based framework which utilizes the view information in the feature extraction stage. The proposed framework learns a view-specific network for each camera view with a cross-view Euclidean constraint (CV-EC) and a cross-view center loss. We utilize the CV-EC to decrease the margin of the features between diverse views and extend the center loss metric to a view-specific version to better adapt the re-id problem. Moreover, we propose an iterative algorithm to optimize the parameters of the view-specific networks from coarse to fine.

However, most existing methods assume sensors to have one fixed sensing range. Prevalence of sensors with adjustable sensing ranges posts two new challenges to the topic: 1) expanded search space, due to the rise in the number of possible activation modes and 2) more complex energy allocation, as the sensors differ in the energy consumption rate when using different sensing ranges. These two challenges make it hard to directly solve the lifetime maximization problem of WSNs with range-adjustable sensors (LM-RASs). This article proposes a neighborhood-based estimation of distribution algorithm (NEDA) to address it in a recursive manner. In NEDA, each individual represents a coverage scheme in which the sensors are selectively activated to monitor all the targets. A linear programming (LP) model is built to assign activation time to the schemes in the population so that their sum, the network lifetime, can be maximized conditioned on the current population. Using the activation time derived from LP as individual fitness, the NEDA is driven to seek coverage schemes promising for prolonging the network lifetime. The network lifetime is thus optimized by repeating the steps of the coverage scheme evolution and LP model solving. To encourage the search for diverse coverage schemes, a neighborhood sampling strategy is introduced. Besides, a heuristic repair strategy is designed to fine-tune the existing schemes for further improving the search efficiency. Experimental results on WSNs of different scales show that NEDA outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. It is also expected that NEDA can serve as a potential framework for solving other flexible LP problems that share the same structure with LM-RAS.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2020.2977858","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9052704","Estimation of distribution algorithm;lifetime maximization;neighborhood;wireless sensor network (WSN)","Wireless sensor networks;Sensors;Sociology;Statistics;Batteries;Energy consumption;Resource management","","","","","","CCBY","1 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Following this idea, this paper proposes a search direction adaptation evolution strategy (SDA-ES) which achieves linear time and space complexity. SDA-ES models the covariance matrix with an identity matrix and multiple search directions, and uses a heuristic to update the search directions in a way similar to the principal component analysis. We also generalize the traditional 1/5th success rule to adapt the mutation strength which exhibits the derandomization property. Numerical comparisons with nine state-of-the-art algorithms are carried out on 31 test problems. The experimental results have shown that SDA-ES is invariant under search-space rotational transformations, and is scalable with respect to the number of variables.

However, such framework suffers from adversarial attacks which confuse neural networks via adding quasi-imperceptible noises to input images without changing the ground truth annotated by human subjects. To our knowledge, this paper is the first one that mounts successful adversarial attacks on salient object detection models and verifies that adversarial samples are effective on a wide range of existing methods. Furthermore, this paper proposes a novel end-to-end trainable framework to enhance the robustness for arbitrary FCN-based salient object detection models against adversarial attacks. The proposed framework adopts a novel idea that first introduces some new generic noise to destroy adversarial perturbations, and then learns to predict saliency maps for input images with the introduced noise. Specifically, our proposed method consists of a segment-wise shielding component, which preserves boundaries and destroys delicate adversarial noise patterns and a context-aware restoration component, which refines saliency maps through global contrast modeling.

This type of noise frequently arises in data acquisition and transmission due to many reasons, e.g., a faulty sensor or analog-to-digital converter errors. Removing this noise is an important task in image restoration. State-of-the-art methods such as Adaptive Outlier Pursuit(AOP) [1] , which is based on TV with $\ell _{02}$-norm data fidelity, only give sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a new sparse optimization method, called $\ell _0TV$-PADMM, which solves the TV-based restoration problem with $\ell _0$-norm data fidelity. To effectively deal with the resulting non-convex non-smooth optimization problem, we first reformulate it as an equivalent biconvex Mathematical Program with Equilibrium Constraints (MPEC), and then solve it using a proximal Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (PADMM). Our $\ell _0TV$-PADMM method finds a desirable solution to the original $\ell _0$-norm optimization problem and is proven to be convergent under mild conditions.

It is shown through simulation results that the average AoI and energy cost are mainly influenced by network parameters in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region.

The implementation of the DSC is accomplished based on the protocol combining pinning control and in-group and inter-group information exchange of multi-agent system. Accordingly, the DSC of the MMG is converted to the distributed multiple DG-clusters control, and the control process is tuned to tracking group synchronisation to pinning-based anticipative consensus in DG-clusters. In this way, the implementation of many MMG functions, such as global coordination among MGs, local autonomy in an MG, reliability, scalability, and self-healing are all simplified.

In this paper, to better align image and language domains in diverse and unrestricted cases, we propose a novel neural network model that performs global reasoning on a dependency tree parsed from the question, and we thus phrase our model as parse-tree-guided reasoning network (PTGRN). This network consists of three collaborative modules: i) an attention module to exploit the local visual evidence for each word parsed from the question, ii) a gated residual composition module to compose the previously mined evidence, and iii) a parse-tree-guided propagation module to pass the mined evidence along the parse tree. Our PTGRN is thus capable of building an interpretable VQA system that gradually derives the image cues following a question-driven parse-tree reasoning route.

In this paper, we develop a two-stage taxi-passenger matching system to deal with these two tasks. In the first stage, we design a fuzzy controller to assign a priority score to each taxi-passenger pair in real time. To ensure its performance on providing good QoS and profit, the fuzzy controller is optimized by an offline differential evolution algorithm. New individual representation is designed to optimize the membership functions and fuzzy rule base simultaneously. To accelerate the optimization process, the algorithm is implemented in a parallel way. Then, in the second stage, considering the priority scores as weights in the bipartite graph of taxi and passenger sets, we further apply a polynomial Kuhn-Munkres algorithm to find the maximum weight perfect matching in the bipartite graph.

The two problems seriously challenge the feasibility of conventional 1-D sparse reconstruction algorithms. This article proposes a novel high-resolution ISAR imaging and motion compensation with the 2-D joint sparse reconstruction (2D-JSR) algorithm. In this technique, a 2D-JSR dictionary is established according to the SSFM-SAW signal model. Based on the Bayesian compressive sensing (BCS) theory, the 2D-JSR is then transformed into solving a sparsity-driven optimization problem with l�?-norm constraint. With the accommodation of a modified quasi-Newton solver, the exact recovery of SSFM-SAW can be achieved. In addition, a new algorithm, named joint translational motion compensation and range spatial-variant autofocus (JTSVA) algorithm, is also developed to realize motion parameters by a two-step estimation. Integrating with 2-D coupling information of echo signal and the efficient and robust motion compensation algorithm, the accurate motion parameters together with well-focused and scaled high-resolution ISAR images can be obtained.

As a result, limited by low data rate due to nonsequential processing, accurate ranging usually performs low efficiency in practical application. Similarly, without applying accurate ranging, the data after thresholding and clustering are used in wideband tracking, leading to a significant decrease in tracking accuracy. In this article, an integrated Kalman filter of accurate ranging and tracking is proposed using methods of phase-derived-ranging and Bayesian inference in wideband radar. Besides the motion state, in this integrated Kalman filter, the complex-valued high-resolution range profile (HRRP) is also introduced as a reference signal by coherent integration in a sliding window, which incorporates target's scattering distribution and phase characteristics. Corresponding kinetic equations are derived to predict the motion state and the reference signal in the next moment. A ranging process is constructed based on the received signal and the predicted reference signal in order to estimate innovation using methods of phase-derived-ranging and Bayesian inference, and a sequential update for motion state can be accomplished with the Kalman filter as well. In every recursion, the complex-valued reference signal is also updated by coherently integrating the latest pulses. The integrated Kalman filter takes full use of high range resolution and phase information, improving both efficiency and precision compared with conventional approaches of ranging and wideband tracking. Implemented in a sequential manner, the integrated Kalman filter can be applied in a real-time application, realizing simultaneous ranging with high precision and wideband tracking.

Inspired by the following two facts, we come up with a method to handle soft goals problem, and it also efficient with classical planning problems. Firstly, using external information has turned out to be a fruitful approach for classical planning; secondly, strategies in incremental planning for ordering and grouping subproblems partitioned by the subgoals of a planning problem have recently draw a lot attention from planning community. In this paper we present an approach to combining incremental planning with control knowledge and this approach can be used to handle soft goals. Our method improved incremental planning using goal agenda with more ordering for atomic goal and grouping subproblems partitioned by the subgoals.

In this scheme, we exploit the MPPM patterns to transmit the extra information bits without the increase of the signal bandwidth and, thus, improving the SE. Specifically, for each frame, the binary information stream is divided into two parallel groups, where the first group is used to select the patterns of MPPM symbols, while the other is modulated by optical OFDM. Then, the time-domain OFDM signal is accommodated by both the “on�? and “off�? slots of MPPM symbols for transmissions over the VLC channel. With the aid of a forward error correction aided decision feedback approach, the system performance can be further improved. Theoretical analyses on the dimming level, the average power consumption and the frame error probability are provided and verified by simulation results. It is shown that the proposed system with extended dimming control can achieve the highest effective spectral efficiency in most scenarios without substantially increasing the computational complexity, while still maintaining a power consumption level similar to those of the reference systems.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2018.2838562","General Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China; Basic Research Project of Guangdong Provincial NSF; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8361415","Dimming control;effective spectral efficiency (ESE);multiple pulse position modulation (MPPM);reverse polarity optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (RPO-OFDM);visible light communication (VLC)","OFDM;Optical modulation;Optical transmitters;Optical receivers;Optical pulses;Adaptive optics","error statistics;forward error correction;free-space optical communication;OFDM modulation;optical modulation;pulse position modulation","enhanced multiple pulse position modulation;reverse polarity optical OFDM system;extended dimming control;dimmable visible light communication systems;MPPM patterns;binary information stream;MPPM symbols;forward error correction aided decision feedback approach;system performance;MPPM aided reverse polarity optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing scheme;spectral efficiency;time-domain OFDM signal;frame error probability","","1","22","","21 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Different from the existing forward inferring methods, our method builds a reverse mapping network that maps the multitype cardiac indices to cardiac images. The task dependencies are then learned and shared to multitask learning networks using an adversarial training approach. Finally, we transfer the parameters learned from MRI to CT.

Moreover, Network Function Virtualization (NFV) has been an emerging technology that transforms from traditional dedicated hardware implementations to software instances running in a virtualized environment. In NFV, the requested service is implemented by a sequence of Virtual Network Functions (VNF) that can run on generic servers by leveraging the virtualization technology. Service Function Chaining (SFC) is defined as a chain-ordered set of placed VNFs that handles the traffic of the delivery and control of a specific application. NFV therefore allows to allocate network resources in a more scalable and elastic manner, offer a more efficient and agile management and operation mechanism for network functions and hence can largely reduce the overall costs in MEC. In this paper, we study the problem of how to place VNFs on edge and public clouds and route the traffic among adjacent VNF pairs, such that the maximum link load ratio is minimized and each user's requested delay is satisfied. We consider this problem for both totally ordered SFCs and partially ordered SFCs. We prove that this problem is NP-hard, even for the special case when only one VNF is requested.

While applying computation-intensive deep learning on IIoT devices, however, it is challenging to meet the critical latency requirement for industrial manufacturing. Traditional wisdom resorts to the cloud-centric paradigm but still works either inefficiently or ineffectively due to the heavy transmission latency overhead. To address this challenge, we propose Boomerang, an on-demand cooperative DNN inference framework for edge intelligence under the IIoT environment. Boomerang exploits DNN right-sizing and DNN partition to execute DNN inference tasks with low latency as well as high accuracy. DNN right-sizing reshapes the amount of DNN computation via the early-exit mechanism so as to reduce the total runtime of DNN inference. DNN partition adaptively segments DNN computation between the IoT devices and the edge server in order to leverage hybrid computation resources to achieve DNN inference immediacy. Combining these two keys, Boomerang carefully selects the partition point and the exit point to maximize the performance while promising the efficiency requirement. To further reduce the manual overhead of model profiling at the install phase, we develop an advanced version of Boomerang with the DRL model, achieving end-to-end automatic DNN inference plan generation. The prototype implementation and evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of Boomerang on both versions in achieving efficient edge intelligence for IIoT.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.001.1800506","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8863733","","Internet of Things;Servers;Bandwidth;Neural networks;Cloud computing;Runtime;Task analysis","Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);manufacturing systems;neural nets;production engineering computing","deep neural network inference;smart industry;AI algorithms;computation-intensive deep learning;IIoT devices;industrial manufacturing;cloud-centric paradigm;IIoT environment;DNN inference tasks;DNN computation;IoT devices;edge server;DNN inference immediacy;end-to-end automatic DNN inference plan generation;DNN partition;edge intelligence","","3","15","","9 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In order to detect impulse noises in corrupted images, a statistic named local consensus index (LCI) is proposed for quantitatively evaluating how noise free a pixel is, and then an impulse noise detection scheme based on LCI is introduced. First, the similarity between arbitrary two pixels in an image is quantified based on both their geometric distance and intensity difference, and the LCI of arbitrary pixel is calculated by summing all the similarity values of pixels in its neighborhood. As a new statistic, the value of LCI indicates the local consensus of the concerned pixel regarding its neighbors and could also tell whether a pixel is noise free or impulsive. Therefore, LCI can be directly used as an efficient indicator of impulse noise. Furthermore, to improve the performance of impulse noise detection, different strategies are applied to the pixels at flat regions and the ones with complex textures, since distributions of LCI value within those regions are totally different. As for impulse noise filtering, a hybrid graph Laplacian regularization (HGLR) method is introduced to restore the intensities of those pixels degraded by impulse noise. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our impulsive noise detection and reduction method, and the results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of impulse detection and noise removal.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2019.2925886","Key Laboratory of Digital Signal and Image Processing of Guangdong Province; Doctoral Initiating Project of Guangdong Ocean University; Innovation and Strength Project of Guangdong Ocean University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8770265","Image denoising;local consensus index (LCI);noise detection systems;random-valued impulse noise","Image restoration;Noise measurement;Roads;Indexes;Standards;Oceans;Detectors","","","","","","","23 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In FLMC-SAR imaging framework, the left-right Doppler ambiguity is expected to resolve with beamforming approaches using the multichannel system diversity. However, beamforming-based Doppler ambiguity resolving is sensitive to the array deviation angle, which causes a mismatch between the azimuth angle and Doppler frequency. In this article, we propose an array deviation angle calibration and imagery algorithm for FLMC-SAR. The space-time characteristic of FLMC-SAR is explored and the range-dependent array deviation angle model is established. Following the Doppler beam sharpening imaging, strong targets are selected to derive the mismatch of the space-time characteristic. A maximum likelihood estimation of the array deviation angle is developed to modify the matching between the azimuth angle and Doppler frequency.

To integrate more comprehensive information from different views, this paper innovates a fuzzy clustering model using the low-rank tensor to address the multiview data clustering problem. Our method firstly conducts a standard fuzzy clustering on different views of the data separately. Then, the obtained soft partition results are aggregated as the new data to be handled by a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based fuzzy model with low-rank tensor constraints. The KL divergence function, which replaces the traditional minimized Euclidean distance, can enhance the robustness of the model. More importantly, we formulate fuzzy partition matrices of different views as a third-order tensor. So a low-rank tensor is introduced as a norm constraint in the KL divergence-based fuzzy clustering to obtain dexterously high-order correlations of different views. The minimization of final model is convex and we present an efficient Augmented Lagrangian alternating direction method (ALADM) to handle this problem.

Among them, constraints on sparseness have received much attention recently. Some popular constraints such as non-negativity, lasso penalty, and (plain) orthogonality etc have been so far applied to extract sparse features. However, little work has been done to give theoretical and experimental analyses on the differences of the impacts of different constraints within a framework. In this paper, we analyze the problem in a more general framework called Constrained Sparse Matrix Factorization (CSMF). In CSMF, a particular case called CSMF with non-negative components (CSMFnc) is further discussed. Unlike NMF, CSMFnc allows not only additive but also subtractive combinations of non-negative sparse components. It is useful to produce much sparser features than those produced by NMF and meanwhile have better reconstruction ability, achieving a trade-off between sparseness and low MSE value. Moreover, for optimization, an alternating algorithm is developed and a gentle update strategy is further proposed for handling the alternating process. Experimental analyses are performed on the Swimmer data set and CBCLface database. In particular, CSMF can successfully extract all the proper components without any ghost on Swimmer, gaining a significant improvement over the compared well-known algorithms.","2380-7504","978-1-4244-1630-1","10.1109/ICCV.2007.4408911","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4408911","","Sparse matrices;Principal component analysis;Data mining;Feature extraction;Independent component analysis;Subspace constraints;Sun;Computer vision;Mathematics;Automation","computer vision;feature extraction;image representation;independent component analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix decomposition;optimisation;sparse matrices","constrained sparse matrix factorization;linear subspace methods;sparse feature extraction;nonnegative components;CSMF optimization;object representation learning;computer vision;ICA","","4","15","","26 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a novel model of Semantic GAN, which integrates the semantic guidance and the recent CycleGAN. In particular, we present a semantic style loss with Gram matrix to well preserve the semantic information in the generated images. The proposed Semantic GAN can control the transfer in the right way with semantic masks and solve the mismatching problem.

Hence, the proposed approach can detect the noisy elements if the measurements are contaminated with additive white Gaussian noise plus sparse noise with large magnitude, which could be caused by data injection attacks.

In this paper, a continuous-time zeroing neurodynamics (CTZN) model for quadratic programming is first obtained via zeroing neurodynamics (ZN) method. Then, a general four-step Zhang et al. discretization formula is presented and adopted to discretize the above CTZN model, and thus the general four-step discrete-time ZN (DTZN) algorithm for the FQP is developed. For comparison, a three-step DTZN algorithm and a one-step DTZN algorithm for the FQP are also presented. It is worth noting that there is an important parameter termed stepsize in the DTZN algorithms, which is closely related to their stability. If the value of stepsize is outside its effective interval, the DTZN algorithms are impossible to achieve convergence in terms of residual errors, which leads to failure of the FQP problem solving. By utilizing bilinear transformation and Routh stability criterion, the effective stepsize interval of the general four-step DTZN algorithm is confirmed via theoretical proof. Besides, numerical results substantiate the effectiveness and superiority of the general four-step DTZN algorithm as well as the accuracy of the effective stepsize interval.

Recently, human body communication (HBC) has been proposed in which the body itself is used as the propagation medium. To achieve high spectrum efficiency and power efficiency by HBC, one critical work is to acquire the channel information. In this paper, the HBC channel fading characteristics are measured and summarized. It is shown that the HBC channel is influenced by the body shape instead of the outside environment. When human body is in movement, normal random process can be used to describe the variations of HBC channel fading. Then, we propose a dynamic pilot interval adjustment scheme for HBC channel estimation. By applying this scheme, the pilot intervals in time domain can be adjusted along with the time-varying channel fading. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated by using measurement-based HBC channel fading model. It is proved that this scheme can substantially reduce the number of pilots without losing much accuracy and it can be beneficial for saving energy in the HBC networks.","","978-1-5090-2136-9","10.1109/ICCChinaW.2016.7586721","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7586721","channel estimation;dynamic pilot interval;energy efficiency;human body communication (HBC);wireless body area network (WBAN)","Fading channels;Channel estimation;Shape;Fitting;Wireless communication;Transmitters;Electrodes","body area networks;channel estimation;fading channels;Internet of Things;radio spectrum management","dynamic pilot interval adjustment scheme;HBC channel estimation;human body communication channel estimation;Internet-of-things;wireless body area networks;RF-based WBAN;radio frequency-based WBAN;spectrum efficiency;power efficiency;channel information acquisition;HBC channel fading characteristics;normal random process;time-varying channel fading","","","8","","10 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Firstly, by means of the basic laws of fuzzy logic, a general fuzzy opacity (GFO) measure, as a template, is presented for the given generalized characterizations of secret and non-secret behaviors. Moreover, a specific measure, called as fuzzy initial-final opacity (FIFO) measure, is investigated under the assumption that the secrets and non-secrets can be coded into the initial-final state-pairs. In addition, two variants of FIFO measure are also proposed under the assumptions that the secrets and non-secrets are only related to the initial-states or final-states. With these fuzzy opacity measures, the system designers can evaluate the opacity degree of the systems to be designed.

By virtue of the lifting matrix/vector technique, the ILC processes of two kinds of 2-D FMMII are transformed into 2-D linear inequalities. As a result, robust and convergent conditions are obtained for the proposed ILC laws. It is theoretically proved that by using the proposed ILC laws, under the discussed iteration-dependent uncertainties, the ILC tracking errors of 2-D FMMII can be driven into a residual range, the bound of which is relevant to the bound parameters of uncertainties. In particular, when the iteration-dependent uncertainties of 2-D FMMII are progressively convergent in iteration domain, an accurate tracking to the desired reference trajectory can be realized except at the boundaries.

To do so, we trained an identical feature extractor for all data, and the extracted features were fed into corresponding softmax classifiers. Spectral knowledge was introduced to ensure that the shared features were similar across domains. Four hyperspectral data sets were used in the experiments. We achieved higher classification accuracies on three data sets (Pavia University, Pavia Center, and Indian Pines) and competitive results on the Salinas Valley data compared with the baseline.

However, we know little about these algorithms from the theoretical aspect. In this paper, we present running time analysis of a simple MOEA with mutation and crossover based on the MOEA/D framework (MOEA/D-C) on five pseudo-Boolean functions. Our rigorous theoretical analysis shows that by properly setting the number of subproblems, the upper bounds of expected running time of MOEA/D-C obtaining a set of solutions to cover the Pareto fronts (PFs) of these problems are apparently lower than those of the one with mutation-only (MOEA/D-M). Moreover, to effectively obtain a set of solutions to cover the PFs of these problem, MOEA/D-C only needs to decompose these MOPs into several subproblems with a set of simple weight vectors while MOEA/D-M needs to find Ω(n) optimally decomposed weight vectors. This result suggests that the use of crossover in decomposition-based MOEA can simplify the setting of weight vectors for different problems and make the algorithm more efficient. This paper provides some insights into the working principles of MOEA/D and explains why some existing decomposition-based MOEAs work well in computational experiments.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2019.2930979","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Public Welfare Technology Application Research Plan Project of Zhejiang Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8804351","Crossover;MOEA/D;multiobjective optimization problem (MOP);running time analysis","Optimization;Upper bound;Computer science;Indexes;Cybernetics;Evolutionary computation","","","","","","","16 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Main contributions of the 3DTANet are: (i) A novel Transmissible Attention (TA) mechanism is introduced, which can transfer attention information between convolution layers. Different from traditional attention mechanism, not only can it convey accumulated attention information layer by layer but also guide the network to retain holistic attention information. (ii) We propose a Three-Dimension Attention (3DA) mechanism, which is capable of extracting a three-dimensional attention map. While previous researches on image attention mechanism extracts channel or spatial attention information separately, 3DA mechanism pays attention to channel and spatial information simultaneously, thereby making them play better complementary role in attention extraction. (iii) A new loss function named L2-norm Multi-labels Loss (L2ML) is applied to acquire higher recognition accuracy calculated by multi labels of same ID and corresponding feature representation. Quite different from the common loss functions, L2-norm Multi-labels Loss is specifically good at optimizing feature distance. In brief, 3DTANet gains two-fold benefit toward higher accuracy. For one thing, the attention information is informative and can be transmitted, feature being more representative. For another, our model is computationally lightweight and can be easily applied to real scenarios. We extensively conduct experiments on four Person Re-Identification benchmark datasets.

Despite success, the existing methods mainly focus on the lower-order connectivity structure at the level of individual nodes and edges. And the higher-order connectivity structure has been largely ignored, which contains better signature of community compared with edges. The main challenges in utilizing higher-order structure for multi-layer network community detection are that the most representative higher-order structure may vary from one layer to another and the connectivity structure formed by the same node subset may exhibit different higher-order connectivity patterns in different layers. To this end, this paper proposes a novel higher-order structure, termed harmonic motif, which is a dense subgraph having on average the largest statistical significance in each layer. Based on the harmonic motif, a primary layer is constructed by integrating higher-order structural information from all layers. Additionally, the higher-order structural information of each individual layer is taken as the auxiliary information. A coupling is established between the primary layer and each auxiliary layer. Accordingly, a harmonic motif modularity is designed to generate the community structure. Extensive experiments on eleven real-world multi-layer network datasets have been conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2019.2956532","Tip-top Scientific and Technical Innovative Youth Talents of Guangdong special support program; Guangdong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8917579","Community detection;multi-layer network;higher-order structure;motif;modularity","Harmonic analysis;Image edge detection;Couplings;Sociology;Electroencephalography;Biochemistry;Brain modeling","","","","","","","28 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

An important characteristic of DrBMST codes is that the degrees of the constraint nodes in their normal graphs are at most three. As a result, DrBMST codes can be decoded with low complexity. We first prove that the error probability of an enlarged DrBMST code ensemble can be made arbitrarily small under windowed maximum-likelihood decoding (MLD) by increasing the decoding window size. This result partially explains the superior performances of DrBMST codes. Then we propose to use the extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart analysis to estimate the iterative windowed decoding thresholds of DrBMST codes. The EXIT chart analyses show that, with such a simple structure, DrBMST codes are comparable to BMST codes with large encoding memories in terms of decoding thresholds. Finally, we carry out comparisons to validate the advantages of DrBMST codes in terms of error performances and decoding complexities. In particular, for a decoding latency of 20,000 bits, the DrBMST code performs better than the (4,8)-regular spatially coupled low-density parity-check (SC-LDPC) code, but with lower computational complexity. Hence, DrBMST codes can be used in communication systems with limited computational resources.

For measuring the consistency of overlapping community structures across different views, the Jaccard similarity is adopted to measure the first-order structural consistency of one node across different views, based on which a cross-view community consistency model is established. One objective function is defined by integrating the above two components. By solving the objective function via the alternative coordinate gradient ascent method, the optimal community membership strength vectors are generated, from which the multi-view overlapping community structure is obtained.

The minimum spanning tree (MST) clustering algorithm was applied to reduce the background noise. Then, the images' features are extracted from the clustering result and classified by support vector machine (SVM).

Motivated by the above observations, we design a new deep-learning algorithm for fast salient object detection.

In this paper, our motivation is to address this issue by fully utilizing temporal information. Specially, a novel light-weight Voting-based Temporal Correlation (VTC) module is proposed to enhance temporal information. Multiple branches with different temporal sampling intervals are included in this module and they are regarded as voters. The final classification result is “voted�? by these branches together. VTC module integrates sparse temporal sampling strategy into feature sequences, so it mitigates the effect of redundant information and focuses more on temporal modeling. Additionally, we propose a simple and intuitive Similarity Loss (SL) to guide the training procedure of the VTC module and the backbone network. When we introduce confusion in the predicted vector intentionally, SL eases intra-class variation by discovering class-specific common motion patterns rather than sample-specific discriminative information. SL neither needs excessive parameter tuning during training nor adds significant computation overhead during test time. By combining VTC module and SL with complementary advances in the field, we clearly outperform state-of-the-art results and achieve 83.0, 98.4, 49.6 and 77.8 accuracy on HMDB51, UCF101, something-something-v1, and Kinetics respectively.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2020.2978855","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9026815","action recognition;temporal correlation;class-specific;temporal sampling","Correlation;Training;Shape;Two dimensional displays;Kernel;Image recognition;Three-dimensional displays","","","","","","","6 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The proposed strategy is implemented based on a multi-agent system framework, which only requires information exchanges among neighboring agents. The proposed distributed control solution enables the sharing of computational and communication burden among distributed agents, thus it is robust, scalable, and convenient for plug-and-play operation which allows PEVs to join and leave at arbitrary times.

As a fundamental building block, an advanced pixel has thus been developed to tackle clinical challenges. However, all types of pixel architectures, either passive or active, unanimously keep sensing, storage, and readout components separate. This is disadvantageous in further reducing pixel size and improving spatial resolution. To address these problems, we hereby propose a novel architecture, which combines the abovementioned three functional units in one single dual-gate photo-TFT. In other words, the dual-gate photo-TFT alone works as a sensor, a storage, and a switch. In addition, by harnessing the amplification effect of TFT, it, for the first time, realizes one single-transistor active pixel sensor that makes a tremendous promise in achieving low-dose X-ray imaging for DR.

Therefore, the problem of quality prediction for Web services has attracted a lot of attention in the past several years, with a focus on the application of the Matrix Factorization (MF) technique. Recently, researchers have started to employ user similarity to improve MF-based prediction methods for Web services. However, none of the existing methods has properly and systematically addressed two of the major issues: 1) retrieving appropriate neighborhood information, i.e., similar users and services; 2) utilizing full neighborhood information, i.e., both users' and services' neighborhood information. In this paper, we propose CNMF, a covering-based quality prediction method for Web services via neighborhood-aware matrix factorization. The novelty of CNMF is twofold. First, it employs a covering-based clustering method to find similar users and services, which does not require the number of clusters and cluster centroids to be prespecified. Second, it utilizes neighborhood information on both users and services to improve the prediction accuracy. The results of experiments conducted on a real-world dataset containing 1,974,675 Web service invocation records demonstrate that CNMF significantly outperforms eight existing quality prediction methods, including two state-of-the-art methods that also utilize neighborhood information with MF.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2019.2891517","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8606070","quality of service;quality prediction;matrix factorization;neighborhood information;covering algorithm","Web services;Quality of service;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Computer science;Time factors","","","","5","","","9 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In an N x N CICQ switch, the switching fabric is a nonblocking buffered crossbar, a large input buffer is provided at each input and a relatively small internal buffer is provided at each crosspoint of the buffered crossbar. Each input buffer is logically organized as N virtual output queues (VOQs). In this paper, we build the queueing model for evaluating the delay performance of a CICQ switch under i.i.d uniform 2-state Markov modulated Bernoulli process (2-MMBP) bursty traffic. The accuracy of the queuing model is examined via computer simulation, by investigating the mean cell delay in a switch as a function of the switch size, the internal buffer size, the mean offered load and the mean burst length.

To our knowledge, it is the first motifs-finding method based on DFT. It can get the global optimum more easily than other existing statistical model based methods.

Hence we introduce a novel Hierarchical Federated Edge Learning (HFEL) framework in which model aggregation is partially migrated to edge servers from the cloud. We further formulate a joint computation and communication resource allocation and edge association problem for device users under HFEL framework to achieve global cost minimization. To solve the problem, we propose an efficient resource scheduling algorithm in the HFEL framework. It can be decomposed into two subproblems: resource allocation given a scheduled set of devices for each edge server and edge association of device users across all the edge servers. With the optimal policy of the convex resource allocation subproblem for a set of devices under a single edge server, an efficient edge association strategy can be achieved through iterative global cost reduction adjustment process, which is shown to converge to a stable system point.

Based on the historical QoS data, collaborative QoS prediction methods employ memory-based collaborative filtering (CF), model-based CF, or their hybrids to predict QoS values. However, these methods usually only consider the QoS information of similar users and services, neglecting the correlation between them.

To address this problem, this paper proposes a real-time pricing mechanism that can successfully regulate the collective charging load to track a given load profile. The mechanism design consists of three steps. First, we propose two aggregated models for PET fleet to characterize, separately, the relationship between charging decisions of the fleet and real time prices, and the relationship between energy dynamics and charging decisions of the fleet. Then, an optimization problem is designed to calculate the optimal charging load profile that can be accomplished by the fleet.

In this paper, a new kernel learning method is proposed to improve the discrimination performance of CMMD. It can be operated with deep network features iteratively and thus denoted as KLN for abbreviation. The CMMD loss and an autoencoder (AE) are used to learn an injective function. By considering the compound kernel, that is, the injective function with a characteristic kernel, the effectiveness of CMMD for data category description is enhanced. KLN can simultaneously learn a more expressive kernel and label prediction distribution; thus, it can be used to improve the classification performance in both supervised and semisupervised learning scenarios. In particular, the kernel-based similarities are iteratively learned on the deep network features, and the algorithm can be implemented in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on four benchmark datasets, including MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.

On one hand, the potential relationships between different samples (e.g., patients and health controls) are ignored. The other challenge is that there are usually a limited number of labeled training samples in practical applications. In order to resolve above problems, in this paper we propose a novel attention based semi-supervised dictionary learning (ASSDL) for diagnosis of ASD by exploring the discrimination embedded in the unlabeled data. In the proposed ASSDL, the discriminative relationship hidden in the samples is exploited by learning a class-specific dictionary with designed classcommonality and sample-particularity representation regularizations; while for the unlabeled data, an attention scheme incorporating class-specific reconstruction error is proposed in the label estimation. A good class estimation of unlabeled data and a discriminative dictionary learning will benefit to each other, making the dictionary based classifier better and better. We present an efficient algorithm to minimize the derived objective function and the proposed method shows the promising performance on the four publicly available autism datasets.","","978-1-5386-9214-1","10.1109/ICMEW.2019.00009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8795085","Dictionary Learning;Semi Supervised Learning;Autism Spectrum Disorder;Self-Attention","","biomedical MRI;feature extraction;image classification;image reconstruction;image representation;medical diagnostic computing;medical disorders;supervised learning","class-specific reconstruction error;discriminative dictionary learning;Autism spectrum disorder diagnosis;ASD diagnosis;neuroimaging;machine learning;attention based semisupervised dictionary learning;dictionary based classifier;Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange;fMRI image features","","","20","","15 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The cascaded multiport converter has two stages, where the first stage is for the supercapacitor and the second stage is for the batteries. The two-stage structure can reduce the component rating of the second stage since the batteries are indirectly connected to the DC bus via the supercapacitor at the first stage. Additionally, the second stage with multiple ports is able to integrate multiple batteries. The HESS balances the power mismatch between the generation of the photovoltaics (PV) and the dissipation of the loads, as well as maintains the bus voltage of the DC microgrid. To solve the state-of-charge (SOC) imbalance of multiple batteries for the long lifespan of HESS, a consensus-based control method is developed in this paper to equalize the SOCs among multiple batteries.

This greatly reduces the annotation effort and leads to the creation of a large-scale Re-ID benchmark called SYSU-30k.

However, due to the broadcasting property of optical channels, VLC systems may also suffer from malicious attacks or eavesdropping. In this paper, we present a differential chaos-based modulation with channel scrambling (DCM-CS) for wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) aided VLC system to enhance the transmission security over red, green, and blue (RGB) channels. The proposed scheme exploits the diversity property of light emitting diodes (LED) and the natural high-security property of chaotic sequences being sensitive to the initial value and nonperiodic. At the transmitter, the binary phase shift keying (BPSK) symbols are modulated by the chaotic sequences differentially, then the modulated information-bearing chaotic signals and the corresponding reference chaotic sequences are converted to nonnegative signals and transmitted over RGB channels. It is noticeable that the RGB channels change dynamically and are equivalently scrambled, where the secrecy information is shared in an uncoordinate way between the transmitters and legitimate receivers; hence, the security is further enhanced. Theoretical bit error rate (BER) and secrecy capacity expressions are derived, and simulation results are provided and compared to prove the benefits achieved by the proposed scheme.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2016.2607689","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Normal Project; SYSU-CMU Shunde International Joint Research Institute; Science and Technology Program Projects; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7563849","Differential chaotic modulation;physical layer security;red, green, and blue (RGB) channel scrambling;visible light communication (VLC) system;wavelength division multiplexing (WDM).","Security;Chaotic communication;Wavelength division multiplexing;Binary phase shift keying;Physical layer;Light emitting diodes","error statistics;free-space optical communication;light emitting diodes;optical chaos;optical modulation;optical receivers;optical transmitters;telecommunication channels;telecommunication security;wavelength division multiplexing","high security differential chaos-based modulation;channel scrambling;WDM-aided VLC system;wavelength division multiplexing;visible light communication;radiofrequency channel;line-of-sight propagation;optical channels;malicious attacks;eavesdropping;DCM-CS;transmission security;RGB channels;light emitting diodes;LED;chaotic sequences;transmitter;phase shift keying;BPSK;nonnegative signals;receivers;bit error rate;BER","","9","19","","9 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper aims to provide the tools to optimally size an ESS under the assumption that it will be operated under a model predictive control scheme and that the forecast of the renewable energy resources include prediction errors. A two-stage stochastic model predictive control is formulated and solved, where the optimal usage of the storage is simultaneously determined along with the optimal generation outputs and size of the storage. Wind forecast errors are taken into account in the optimization problem via probabilistic constraints for which an analytical form is derived. This allows for the stochastic optimization problem to be solved directly, without using sampling-based approaches, and sizing the storage to account not only for a wide range of potential scenarios, but also for a wide range of potential forecast errors. In the proposed formulation, we account for the fact that errors in the forecast affect how the device is operated later in the horizon and that a receding horizon scheme is used in operation to optimally use the available storage.","1949-3037","","10.1109/TSTE.2016.2599074","Grid Technologies Collaborative; National Science Foundation; National Energy Technology Laboratory; SYSU-CMU Joint Institute of Engineering; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7536653","Batteries;energy storage;optimal scheduling;power system planning;wind energy","Wind forecasting;Generators;Optimization;Uncertainty;Energy storage;Stochastic processes;Wind power generation","energy storage;load forecasting;power generation control;power generation planning;predictive control;stochastic processes;wind power plants","energy storage sizing;forecast uncertainties;receding horizon operation;energy storage systems;ESS;model predictive control scheme;renewable energy resources;prediction errors;two-stage stochastic model predictive control;wind forecast errors;probabilistic constraints;stochastic optimization problem;forecast errors","","68","24","","9 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We model and integrate the capability of the storage to provide multiple services for the system. Our formulation takes into account wind generation and demand forecast errors as well as short-term fluctuations.

In this paper, we propose an MIMO-aided multiuser optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing VLC system employing an imaging receiver (ImR). The proposed new scheme efficiently mitigates the optical MIMO channel correlations across the multiple photodetectors (PDs) of the same user equipment (UE) or those between different UEs, through invoking a new technique called photodetector selection (PDS). Two possible PDS designs, namely random PDS and modified maximum minimum singular value PDS are investigated. Through both analytical analysis and numerical simulations, we show that the proposed PDS-aided ImR system is capable of outperforming its conventional non-imaging receiver and non-PDS ImR counterparts, especially when UEs are close to each other.

Traditionally, HLS tools build datapath pipelines by inserting pipeline registers to break combinational logic into single-cycle segments; accurately analyzing that the number of available cycles for signal propagation is proven to be infeasible at the RT-level. Thus, RT-level timing analyses must pessimistically assume each path has at most one cycle for signal propagation. This leads to false positives in critical-path analyses, prevents RTL synthesis tools from optimizing real critical paths, and forces HLS flows to insert pipeline registers without improving hardware quality. In this paper, we present an efficient behavioral-level multicycle path analysis (BL-MCPA) algorithm that leverages control-data flow information to reduce time complexity of multicycle path analysis from exponential to polynomial. BL-MCPA helps eliminate false positives in timing analysis, and improves the reported fmax by 15% on average. With BL-MCPA, we avoid unnecessary pipeline register insertion, and reduce execution latency by 25% and register usage by 29% under a user fmax constraint of 300 MHz.

However, shingled magnetic recording (SMR) leads to a narrower track pitch, and thus increased inter-track interference motivating the investigation of array readers and 2-D sectors. In this paper, we investigate SMR on BPM with 2-D sectors at the channel density of 3.71 Tb/in2. Use of 2-D sectors allows the possibility of using either hard or soft information from already detected tracks in that 2-D sector to improve the detection performance on the current track. An important question in this context is whether all tracks in a 2-D sector should be of the same nominal width or if there is a potential benefit to using different widths for adjacent tracks. Based on our investigation, we show that alternating track widths [i.e., one less-trimmed (fat) track followed by one more-trimmed (narrow) track] are beneficial to a bit error rate (BER) perspective. In particular, we propose and investigate the use of a bidirectional decision feedback modified Viterbi (BD-DFMV) detector to improve the BER performance. Our simulations indicate that for a hypothetical 2-D sector with 13 tracks and 5% media noise and at the target BER of 10-2, using alternating track widths and readback with a single reader, the BD-DFMV algorithm can provide about 1.6 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain, compared with using the same detection algorithm but on a 2-D sector with uniform track widths. When using a reader array instead of a single reader, this SNR gain improves to about 2.0 dB. The alternating track width structure also appears to provide more robustness to track mis-registration compared with the 2-D uniform track width case.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2016.2603620","CMU–SYSU Collaborative Innovation Research Center (CIRC); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7553451","Shingled magnetic recording;bit patterned media;decision feedback detection;modified Viterbi;alternating track widths","Two dimensional displays;Fats;Media;Detectors;Magnetic recording;Target tracking;Viterbi algorithm","magnetic recording","bidirectional decision feedback modified Viterbi detection;BD-DFMV;shingled bit-patterned magnetic recording;BPMR;shingled bit-patterned media;BPM recording;magnetic recording density;track pitch;inter-track interference;bit error rate;BER perspective;SNR gain;signal-to-noise ratio gain","","3","17","","26 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a multi-task group bidirectional long short-term memory (MTGBi-LSTM) framework to intelligent recognize multiple CVDs based on multi-lead ECG signals. Methods: This model employs a Group Bi-LSTM (GBi-LSTM) and Residual Group Convolutional Neural Network (Res-GCNN) to learn the dual feature representation of ECG space and time series. GBi-LSTM is divided into Global Bi-LSTM and Intra-Group Bi-LSTM, which can learn the features of each ECG lead and the relationship between leads. Then, through attention mechanism, the different lead information of ECG is integrated to make the model to possess the powerful feature discriminability. Through multi-task learning, the model can fully mine the association information between diseases and obtain more accurate diagnostic results. In addition, we propose a dynamic weighted loss function to better quantify the loss to overcome the imbalance between classes. Results: Based on more than 170,000 clinical 12-lead ECG analysis, the MTGBi-LSTM method achieved accuracy, precision, recall and F1 of 88.86%, 90.67%, 94.19% and 92.39%, respectively.

With the accumulation of physical protein-protein interaction (PPI) data, computational detection of protein complexes from available PPI networks has drawn a lot of attentions. While most of the existing protein complex detection algorithms focus on analyzing the physical protein-protein interaction network, none of them take into account the “signs�? (i.e., activation-inhibition relationships) of physical interactions. As the “signs�? of interactions reflect the way proteins communicate, considering the “signs�? of interactions can not only increase the accuracy of protein complex identification, but also deepen our understanding of the mechanisms of cell functions. In this study, we proposed a novel Signed Graph regularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SGNMF) model to identify protein complexes from signed PPI networks. In our experiments, we compared the results collected by our model on signed PPI networks with those predicted by the state-of-the-art complex detection techniques on the original unsigned PPI networks. We observed that considering the “signs�? of interactions significantly benefits the detection of protein complexes. Furthermore, based on the predicted complexes, we predicted a set of signed complex-complex interactions for each dataset, which provides a novel insight of the higher level organization of the cell.

Infrared (IR) imaging becomes necessary in many visual systems. To that end, matching RGB images with infrared images is required, which are heterogeneous with very different visual characteristics. For person Re-ID, this is a very challenging cross-modality problem that has not been studied so far. In this work, we address the RGB-IR cross-modality Re-ID problem and contribute a new multiple modality Re-ID dataset named SYSU-MM01, including RGB and IR images of 491 identities from 6 cameras, giving in total 287,628 RGB images and 15,792 IR images. To explore the RGB-IR Re-ID problem, we evaluate existing popular cross-domain models, including three commonly used neural network structures (one-stream, two-stream and asymmetric FC layer) and analyse the relation between them. We further propose deep zero-padding for training one-stream network towards automatically evolving domain-specific nodes in the network for cross-modality matching.

Existing VT-ReID methods mainly focus on learning cross-modality sharable feature representations by handling the modality-discrepancy in feature level. However, the modality difference in classifier level has received much less attention, resulting in limited discriminability. In this paper, we propose a novel modality-aware collaborative ensemble (MACE) learning method with middle-level sharable two-stream network (MSTN) for VT-ReID, which handles the modality-discrepancy in both feature level and classifier level. In feature level, MSTN achieves much better performance than existing methods by capturing sharable discriminative middlelevel features in convolutional layers. In classifier level, we introduce both modality-specific and modality-sharable identity classifiers for two modalities to handle the modality discrepancy. To utilize the complementary information among different classifiers, we propose an ensemble learning scheme to incorporate the modality sharable classifier and the modality specific classifiers. In addition, we introduce a collaborative learning strategy, which regularizes modality-specific identity predictions and the ensemble outputs.

In view of cross-modality matching, we verify that aligning modality distributions of the original features is likely to suffer from the selective alignment behavior, \ie, only focuses on easiest dimensions or subspaces. Inspired by adversarial learning, we propose a new \textit{Multi-Patch Modality Alignment} (MPMA) loss to jointly balance and reduce the modality discrepancies of multi-patch features by mining hard subspaces and abandoning easy subspaces. Since multi-patch features are potentially complementary to each other, the semantic correlations between different patches should be exploited during training. Motivated by knowledge distillation, we put forward a new \textit{Cross-Patch Correlation Distillation} (CPCD) loss to transfer the semantic knowledges across different patches. To balance multi-patch tasks, an effective \textit{Patch-Aware Priority Attention} (PAPA) method is further introduced to dynamically prioritize hard patch tasks during training.

We design a neural network that uses a 3D skeleton sequence and a single middle frame from an RGB video as input. Specifically, our method picks up one frame in a video and extracts spatial features from it using two attention modules, a self-attention module and a skeleton-attention module. Further, temporal features are extracted from the skeleton sequence via a BI-LSTM sub-network. Finally, the spatial features and the temporal features are combined via a feature fusion network for action classification. A distinct feature of our method is that it uses only a single RGB frame rather than an RGB video. Accordingly, it has a light-weighted architecture and is more efficient than RGB video-based methods. Comparative evaluation on two public datasets, NTU-RGBD and SYSU, demonstrates that, our method can achieve competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.","2153-0866","978-1-7281-4004-9","10.1109/IROS40897.2019.8967570","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8967570","","","feature extraction;image classification;image colour analysis;image fusion;image motion analysis;image recognition;image sequences;recurrent neural nets;video signal processing","3D skeleton;human-computer interaction;RGB video;multimodal fusion;RGB image;skeleton sequence;self-attention module;skeleton-attention module;feature fusion network;action classification;single RGB frame;RGB video-based methods;action recognition methods;BI-LSTM sub-network","","","46","","28 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In contemporary surveillance, cameras of different modalities such as infrared cameras and depth cameras are introduced because of their unique advantages in poor illumination scenarios. However, re-identifying the persons across such cameras of different modalities is extremely difficult and, unfortunately, seldom discussed. It is mainly caused by extremely different appearances of the person shown under such different camera modalities. In this paper, we tackle this challenging cross-modality people re-identification through a top-push constrained modality-adaptive dictionary learning. The proposed model asymmetrically projects the heterogeneous features from dissimilar modalities onto a common space. In this way, the modality-specific bias is mitigated. Thus, the heterogeneous data can be simultaneously enforced by a shared dictionary in a canonical space. Moreover, a top-push ranking graph regularization is embedded in the proposed model to improve the discriminability, which efficiently further boosts the matching accuracy. In order to implement the proposed model, an iterative process is developed in this paper to optimize these two processes jointly.

The main challenge for this task is that FLLs in CEUS videos often show diverse enhancement patterns at different temporal phases. To handle these diverse patterns, we propose a novel structured model, which detects a number of discriminative Regions of Interest (ROIs) for the FLL and recognize the FLL based on these ROIs. Our model incorporates an ensemble of local classifiers in the attempt to identify different enhancement patterns of ROIs, and in particular, we make the model reconfigurable by introducing switch variables to adaptively select appropriate classifiers during inference. We formulate the model learning as a non-convex optimization problem, and present a principled optimization method to solve it in a dynamic manner: the latent structures (e.g. the selections of local classifiers, and the sizes and locations of ROIs) are iteratively determined along with the parameter learning. Given the updated model parameters in each step, the data-driven inference is also proposed to efficiently determine the latent structures by using the sequential pruning and dynamic programming method. In the experiments, we demonstrate superior performances over the state-of-the-art approaches.

Person ReID, however, is an extremely difficult problem because of variables such as different viewpoints and poses, and varying lighting in person regions in images that have been captured from remote distances. A majority of the studies have been performed for visible-light camera-based person ReID, which can be used only in a limited environment owing to the characteristics of a visible-light camera that are considerably dependent on the illumination. To overcome this problem, studies have been conducted for multimodal camera-based person ReID. However, because the previous studies used two or more input images, the computational complexity was high. This paper proposes a novel person ReID method that simplifies the convolutional neural network (CNN) structure by combining visible-light and thermal images as a single input. This method overcomes the limitation of visible-light camera-based person ReID using both a visible-light and thermal camera. To verify the performance of the proposed method, two open databases, the DBPerson-Recog-DB1, and Sun Yat-sen University multiple modality Re-ID (SYSU-MM01) databases were used.

By naturally combining two recently rising techniques: active learning (AL) and self-paced learning (SPL), our framework is capable of automatically annotating new instances and incorporating them into training under weak expert recertification. We first initialize the classifier using a few annotated samples for each individual, and extract image features using the convolutional neural nets. Then, a number of candidates are selected from the unannotated samples for classifier updating, in which we apply the current classifiers ranking the samples by the prediction confidence. In particular, our approach utilizes the high-confidence and low-confidence samples in the self-paced and the active user-query way, respectively. The neural nets are later fine-tuned based on the updated classifiers. Such heuristic implementation is formulated as solving a concise active SPL optimization problem, which also advances the SPL development by supplementing a rational dynamic curriculum constraint. The new model finely accords with the “instructor-student-collaborative�? learning mode in human education. The advantages of this proposed framework are two-folds: i) The required number of annotated samples is significantly decreased while the comparable performance is guaranteed. A dramatic reduction of user effort is also achieved over other state-of-the-art active learning techniques. ii) The mixture of SPL and AL effectively improves not only the classifier accuracy compared to existing AL/SPL methods but also the robustness against noisy data.

This paper studies a novel computational framework of interactive segmentation for extracting liver tumors from image sequences, and it is suitable for different types of medical data. The main contributions are twofold. First, we propose a collaborative model to jointly formulate the tumor segmentation from two aspects: 1) region partition and 2) boundary presence. The two terms are complementary but simultaneously competing: the former extracts the tumor based on its appearance/texture information, while the latter searches for the palpable tumor boundary. Moreover, in order to adapt the data variations, we allow the model to be discriminatively trained based on both the seed pixels traced by the Lucas-Kanade algorithm and the scribbles placed by the user. Second, we present an effective inference algorithm that iterates to: 1) solve tumor segmentation using the augmented Lagrangian method and 2) propagate the segmentation across the image sequence by searching for distinctive matches between images. We keep the collaborative model updated during the inference in order to well capture the tumor variations over time.

In this paper, we introduce a new long-short graph memory network (LSGM) to improve the capability of LSTM to model the skeleton sequence - a type of graph data. Our proposed LSGM can learn high-level temporal-spatial features end-to-end, enabling LSTM to extract the spatial information that is neglected but intrinsic to the skeleton graph data. To improve the discriminative ability of the temporal and spatial module, we use a calibration module termed as graph temporal-spatial calibration (GTSC) to calibrate the learned temporal-spatial features. By integrating the two modules into the same framework, we obtain a stronger generalization capability in processing dynamic graph data and achieve a significant performance improvement on the NTU and SYSU dataset. Experimental results have validated the effectiveness of our proposed LSGM+GTSC model in extracting temporal and spatial information from dynamic graph data.1","2642-9381","978-1-7281-6553-0","10.1109/WACV45572.2020.9093598","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9093598","","Feature extraction;Convolution;Skeleton;Calibration;Data models;Data mining;Neural networks","feature extraction;graph theory;image recognition;image sequences;recurrent neural nets","long-short graph memory network;long short-term memory network;LSTM;skeleton-based human action recognition;skeleton sequence;spatial information;skeleton graph data;graph temporal-spatial calibration;dynamic graph data;high-level temporal-spatial features;LSGM+GTSC model","","","34","","14 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, the proposed IEL can selectively annotate unlabeled identities with similar appearances to labeled identities, and utilize these unlabeled identities in conjunction with labeled identities to train the person search network.

The existing gender recognition technologies studies have used high-resolution facial images captured from the front at a short distance, which showed high performance. However, intelligent surveillance systems in actual real environments have difficulty in detecting the faces of people because they use images captured from a distance. Moreover, in the case of back-view images, gender recognition based on the facial image is impossible because the face cannot be detected. Thus, gender recognition using the full-body human-body images of people is being studied but its performance is low owing to problems such as low resolution, motion blur, and optical blur. Furthermore, the performance of gender recognition using only visible-light cameras is limited owing to illumination variations, shadow, and the type of clothes and accessories. To solve these problems, remote body-shape-based recognition was performed by sequentially using two convolutional neural networks which improved the resolution of visible-light images. In addition, the degradation of recognition performance owing to various factors (e.g., illumination, shadow, and the type of clothes and accessories) was prevented by combining a visible-light camera with an infrared camera, and the scalability was enhanced using various heterogeneous cameras. The higher performance of the proposed method compared with that of other methods was verified through a comparative experiment using the open database of Sun Yat-sen University multiple modality Re-ID (SYSU-MM01) and the Dongguk body-based gender database (DBGender-DB2) that has been built by us.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2932146","National Research Foundation of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8782507","Gender recognition;visible-light and infrared cameras;image reconstruction;human-body image;convolutional neural network","Feature extraction;Image recognition;Cameras;Surveillance;Face recognition;Image resolution;Principal component analysis","convolutional neural nets;image recognition;image reconstruction","human-body image;intelligent surveillance systems;high-resolution facial images;back-view images;facial image;full-body human-body images;visible-light camera;remote body-shape-based recognition;visible-light images;Dongguk body-based gender database;multimodal camera-based gender recognition;two-step reconstruction network","","","65","CCBY","31 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although a variety of powerful saliency models have been intensively proposed, they usually involve heavy feature (or model) engineering based on priors (or assumptions) about the properties of objects and backgrounds. Inspired by the effectiveness of recently developed feature learning, we provide a novel deep image saliency computing (DISC) framework for fine-grained image saliency computing. In particular, we model the image saliency from both the coarse-and fine-level observations, and utilize the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the saliency representation in a progressive manner. In particular, our saliency model is built upon two stacked CNNs. The first CNN generates a coarse-level saliency map by taking the overall image as the input, roughly identifying saliency regions in the global context. Furthermore, we integrate superpixel-based local context information in the first CNN to refine the coarse-level saliency map. Guided by the coarse saliency map, the second CNN focuses on the local context to produce fine-grained and accurate saliency map while preserving object details. For a testing image, the two CNNs collaboratively conduct the saliency computing in one shot. Our DISC framework is capable of uniformly highlighting the objects of interest from complex background while preserving well object details. Extensive experiments on several standard benchmarks suggest that DISC outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and it also generalizes well across data sets without additional training.

The most crucial factors for this task line in two aspects: the intra-frame representation for joint co-occurrences and the inter-frame representation for skeletons' temporal evolution. The most effective ways focus on spontaneous feature extraction by using deep learning. However, they ignore the structure information of skeleton joints and the correlation between two different skeleton joints for human action recognition. In this paper, we do not simply treat the joints position information as unordered points. Instead, we propose a novel data reorganizing strategy to represent the global and local structure information of human skeleton joints. Meanwhile, we also employ the data mirror to increase the relationship between skeleton joints. Based on this design, we proposed an end-to-end multi-dimensional CNN network (SRNet) to fully consider the spatial and temporal information to learn the feature extraction transform function. Specifically, in this CNN network, we employ different convolution kernels on different dimensions to learn skeleton representation to make the most of human structural information to generate robust features. Finally, we compare with other state-of-the-art on action recognition datasets like NTU RGB+D, PKU-MMD, SYSU, UT-Kinect, and HDM05.

Different from previous works that applied one Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) for each part/joint separately, one pair of structured dynamic images is constructed from depth maps at each granularity level and serves as the input of a ConvNet. The structured dynamic image not only preserves the spatial-temporal information but also enhances the structure information across both body parts/joints and different temporal scales. In addition, it requires low computational cost and memory to construct. This new representation, referred to as Spatially Structured Dynamic Depth Images (S2DDI), aggregates from global to fine-grained levels motion and structure information in a depth sequence, and enables us to fine-tune the existing ConvNet models trained on image data for classification of depth sequences, without a need for training the models afresh.

We develop the Neural Person Search Machines (NPSM) to implement such recursive localization for person search. Benefiting from its neural search mechanism, NPSM is able to selectively shrink its focus from a loose region to a tighter one containing the target automatically. In this process, NPSM employs an internal primitive memory component to memorize the query representation which modulates the attention and augments its robustness to other distracting regions.

In this work, we formulate a deep learning based novel approach to automatic prototype-domain discovery for domain perceptive person re-id. The approach scales to new and unseen scenes without requiring new training data. We learn a separate re-id model for each of the discovered prototype-domains and during model deployment, use the person probe image to automatically select the model of the closest prototype-domain. Our approach requires neither supervised nor unsupervised transfer learning, i.e. no data available from target domains. Extensive evaluations are carried out using automatically detected bounding boxes with low-resolution and partial occlusion on two large scale re-id benchmarks, CUHK-SYSU and PRW.
