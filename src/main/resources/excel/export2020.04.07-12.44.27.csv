An overview of basic concepts of information consensus in networks and methods of convergence and performance analysis for the algorithms are provided. Our analysis framework is based on tools from matrix theory, algebraic graph theory, and control theory. We discuss the connections between consensus problems in networked dynamic systems and diverse applications including synchronization of coupled oscillators, flocking, formation control, fast consensus in small-world networks, Markov processes and gossip-based algorithms, load balancing in networks, rendezvous in space, distributed sensor fusion in sensor networks, and belief propagation. We establish direct connections between spectral and structural properties of complex networks and the speed of information diffusion of consensus algorithms. A brief introduction is provided on networked systems with nonlocal information flow that are considerably faster than distributed systems with lattice-type nearest neighbor interactions. Simulation results are presented that demonstrate the role of small-world effects on the speed of consensus algorithms and cooperative control of multivehicle formations","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2006.887293","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4118472","Consensus algorithms;cooperative control;flocking;graph Laplacians;information fusion;multi-agent systems;networked control systems;synchronization of coupled oscillators","Multiagent systems;Performance analysis;Sensor fusion;Failure analysis;Information analysis;Algorithm design and analysis;Robustness;Network topology;Convergence;Matrices","control systems;multi-agent systems","networked multiagent systems;matrix theory;algebraic graph theory;control theory;networked dynamic systems;information diffusion;consensus algorithms;cooperative control;graph Laplacians;information fusion;networked control systems","","5619","","102","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper develops the modeling and analysis of autonomous operation of inverter-based microgrids. Each sub-module is modeled in state-space form and all are combined together on a common reference frame. The model captures the detail of the control loops of the inverter but not the switching action. Some inverter modes are found at relatively high frequency and so a full dynamic model of the network (rather than an algebraic impedance model) is used. The complete model is linearized around an operating point and the resulting system matrix is used to derive the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues (termed ""modes"") indicate the frequency and damping of oscillatory components in the transient response. A sensitivity analysis is also presented which helps identifying the origin of each of the modes and identify possible feedback signals for design of controllers to improve the system stability. With experience it is possible to simplify the model (reduce the order) if particular modes are not of interest as is the case with synchronous machine models. Experimental results from a microgrid of three 10-kW inverters are used to verify the results obtained from the model","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2006.890003","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4118327","Inverter;inverter model;microgrid;power control;small-signal stability","Power system modeling;Inverters;Stability analysis;Power system stability;Control systems;Damping;Frequency;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Circuit testing;Circuit stability","control system synthesis;distributed power generation;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;invertors;matrix algebra;power system stability;state-space methods;synchronous machines;transient response","autonomous operation testing;inverter-based microgrids;power system small-signal stability;oscillatory modes;state-space modeling;common reference frame;algebraic impedance model;system matrix;eigenvalues;oscillatory damping;transient response;synchronous machine models","","1337","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Frequency and voltage control, including mitigation of voltage harmonics, are achieved without the need for any common control circuitry or communication between inverters. Each inverter supplies a current that is the result of the voltage difference between a reference ac voltage source and the grid voltage across a virtual complex impedance. The reference ac voltage source is synchronized with the grid, with a phase shift, depending on the difference between rated and actual grid frequency. A detailed analysis shows that this approach has a superior behavior compared to existing methods, regarding the mitigation of voltage harmonics, short-circuit behavior and the effectiveness of the frequency and voltage control, as it takes the R to X line impedance ratio into account. Experiments show the behavior of the method for an inverter feeding a highly nonlinear load and during the connection of two parallel inverters in operation.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2007.900456","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4267747","Autonomous power systems;converter control;dispersed generation;finite output-impedance ac voltage source emulation;frequency and voltage droops;harmonics;parallel connection;power quality;microgrids;stand-alone systems;uninterruptible power supplies (UPS);virtual impedance;voltage source inverter;mixed voltage-current control","Frequency;Voltage control;Inverters;Communication system control;Impedance;Power system harmonics;Uninterruptible power systems;Control systems;Circuits;Proportional control","frequency control;harmonics suppression;invertors;power supply quality;uninterruptible power supplies;voltage control","voltage droop control;frequency droop control;parallel inverters;island grid;infinite bus;short-circuit behavior;nonlinear load;autonomous power systems;converter control;dispersed generation;finite output-impedance;power quality;stand-alone systems;uninterruptible power supplies;virtual impedance;voltage source inverter;mixed voltage-current control;short-circuit behavior","","880","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, it has not yet been widely used in multiobjective evolutionary optimization. This paper proposes a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). It decomposes a multiobjective optimization problem into a number of scalar optimization subproblems and optimizes them simultaneously. Each subproblem is optimized by only using information from its several neighboring subproblems, which makes MOEA/D have lower computational complexity at each generation than MOGLS and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). Experimental results have demonstrated that MOEA/D with simple decomposition methods outperforms or performs similarly to MOGLS and NSGA-II on multiobjective 0-1 knapsack problems and continuous multiobjective optimization problems. It has been shown that MOEA/D using objective normalization can deal with disparately-scaled objectives, and MOEA/D with an advanced decomposition method can generate a set of very evenly distributed solutions for 3-objective test instances. The ability of MOEA/D with small population, the scalability and sensitivity of MOEA/D have also been experimentally investigated in this paper.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2007.892759","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4358754","Computational complexity;decomposition;evolutionary algorithm;multiobjective optimization;Pareto optimality;Computational complexity;decomposition;evolutionary algorithm;multiobjective optimization;Pareto optimality","Evolutionary computation;Pareto optimization;Computational complexity;Sorting;Genetic algorithms;Optimization methods;Testing;Scalability;Computer science;Mathematical model","computational complexity;genetic algorithms","multiobjective evolutionary algorithm;scalar optimization subproblem;computational complexity;genetic algorithm;knapsack problem;decomposition","","2906","","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The enhancement of the sparsity is achieved by grouping similar 2D image fragments (e.g., blocks) into 3D data arrays which we call ""groups."" Collaborative Altering is a special procedure developed to deal with these 3D groups. We realize it using the three successive steps: 3D transformation of a group, shrinkage of the transform spectrum, and inverse 3D transformation. The result is a 3D estimate that consists of the jointly filtered grouped image blocks. By attenuating the noise, the collaborative filtering reveals even the finest details shared by grouped blocks and, at the same time, it preserves the essential unique features of each individual block. The filtered blocks are then returned to their original positions. Because these blocks are overlapping, for each pixel, we obtain many different estimates which need to be combined. Aggregation is a particular averaging procedure which is exploited to take advantage of this redundancy. A significant improvement is obtained by a specially developed collaborative Wiener filtering. An algorithm based on this novel denoising strategy and its efficient implementation are presented in full detail; an extension to color-image denoising is also developed. The experimental results demonstrate that this computationally scalable algorithm achieves state-of-the-art denoising performance in terms of both peak signal-to-noise ratio and subjective visual quality.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2007.901238","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4271520","Adaptive grouping;block matching;image denoising;sparsity;3-D transform shrinkage","Image denoising;Collaboration;Filtering;Noise reduction;Signal processing algorithms;Signal processing;Energy resolution;Spatial resolution;Signal resolution;Discrete cosine transforms","image colour analysis;image denoising;image enhancement;image representation;Wiener filters","image denoising;3D transform-domain collaborative filter;sparse representation;image fragment;image enhancement;Wiener filter","Algorithms;Artifacts;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","3274","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A standard approach consists in minimizing an objective function which includes a quadratic (squared ) error term combined with a sparseness-inducing regularization term. Basis pursuit, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), wavelet-based deconvolution, and compressed sensing are a few well-known examples of this approach. This paper proposes gradient projection (GP) algorithms for the bound-constrained quadratic programming (BCQP) formulation of these problems. We test variants of this approach that select the line search parameters in different ways, including techniques based on the Barzilai-Borwein method. Computational experiments show that these GP approaches perform well in a wide range of applications, often being significantly faster (in terms of computation time) than competing methods. Although the performance of GP methods tends to degrade as the regularization term is de-emphasized, we show how they can be embedded in a continuation scheme to recover their efficient practical performance.","1941-0484","","10.1109/JSTSP.2007.910281","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4407762","Compressed sensing;convex optimization;deconvolution;gradient projection;quadratic programming;sparseness;sparse reconstruction","Compressed sensing;Inverse problems;Signal processing;Linear systems;Equations;Deconvolution;Signal processing algorithms;Quadratic programming;Testing;Degradation","deconvolution;inverse problems;optimisation;signal reconstruction;statistical analysis","gradient projection;sparse reconstruction;compressed sensing;inverse problems;signal processing;statistical inference;quadratic error;sparseness-inducing regularization;least absolute shrinkage selection operator;wavelet-based deconvolution;bound-constrained quadratic programming;line search parameters;Barzilai-Borwein method;regularization;convex optimization","","1842","","61","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Wireless sensor networks have been seen as dedicated to one task by one owner. On the other hand, our research is focused on integration of wireless sensor networks into existing networks, primarily mobile ones, and provision of sensor based and/or enhanced services to remote users. Therefore, we have been working on designing an architecture that utilizes the existing infrastructure to interconnect independent wireless sensor networks and to provide data aggregation and actuator control services. In the proposed architecture, sensor networks (small or large, deployed for any purpose and by anyone) represented by their gateways are treated as leaf nodes hanging off a mobile or fixed network that use these networks to interact with remote and local users. Each gateway exposes the capabilities of its sensors, actuators and the sensor network as a whole. This information is used by sensor services middleware to query/command sensor ecosystems on behalf of applications and remote users interested in sensor measurements or actuator control. The details of the interaction between the gateways and its sensors/actuators are of no interest to the remote users. Further, we consider the whole wireless sensor networking landscape as an open market where the underlying mobile and fixed networks facilitate the interaction between the sensor networks and the consumers of the information they produce. Each sensor network is first of all a sensor information provider that offers specific sensor information defined by the type of available sensors and their spatial and temporal conditions to the interested users. Secondly, each sensor network provides actuation services that may potentially affect the information gathered by its sensors. Obviously, in such an environment, where many mobile users are acting as tiny information providers, service discovery, service composition, service provisioning and service authorization are very challenging problems. These problems are addressed in the proposed architecture by introducing a middle layer that aggregates information from all small information providers and provides higher level services to the end users. This layer provides the means to quickly add or remove sensors, actuators, sensor networks, sensor network providers, to modify and enhance the existing or add completely new services utilizing the underlying infrastructure. It could be thought of as a ""plug-and-play"" functionality for: (a) interconnecting different existing sensor networks; (b) adding new sensor networks which facilitate the expansion of the entire system; and (c) expanding the capability of individual sensor networks.","2155-6814","978-1-4244-1454-3","10.1109/MOBHOC.2007.4428690","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4428690","","Wireless sensor networks;Sensor systems;Actuators;Personnel;Aggregates;Middleware;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems and applications;Media Access Protocol;Routing protocols","access protocols;mobile radio;routing protocols;wireless sensor networks","mobile network supported wireless sensor network services;wireless sensor networking;MAC protocols;routing protocols;energy saving;HW design;remote users;data aggregation;actuator control services;leaf nodes;fixed network;sensor services middleware;query/command sensor ecosystems;sensor measurements;sensor information provider;actuation services;service discovery;service composition;service provisioning;service authorization;middle layer","","8","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In graph embedding, each algorithm can be considered as the direct graph embedding or its linear/kernel/tensor extension of a specific intrinsic graph that describes certain desired statistical or geometric properties of a data set, with constraints from scale normalization or a penalty graph that characterizes a statistical or geometric property that should be avoided. Furthermore, the graph embedding framework can be used as a general platform for developing new dimensionality reduction algorithms. By utilizing this framework as a tool, we propose a new supervised dimensionality reduction algorithm called marginal Fisher analysis in which the intrinsic graph characterizes the intraclass compactness and connects each data point with its neighboring points of the same class, while the penalty graph connects the marginal points and characterizes the interclass separability.

Additional design inputs include anatomical and physiological considerations, workspace analyses, and upper limb joint ranges of motion. The database was compiled from 19 arm activities of daily living. The cable-actuated dexterous exoskeleton for neurorehabilitation (CADEN)-7 offers remarkable opportunities as a versatile human-machine interface and as a new generation of assistive technology. Proximal placement of motors and distal placement of cable-pulley reductions were incorporated into the design, leading to low inertia, high-stiffness links, and backdrivable transmissions with zero backlash.

The use of IC engines and hydrogen fuel cells as the primary energy converters for the hybrid vehicles was considered. The study focused on the use of lithium-ion batteries and carbon/carbon ultracapacitors as the energy storage technologies most likely to be used in future vehicles. The key findings of the study are as follows. 1) The energy density and power density characteristics of both battery and ultracapacitor technologies are sufficient for the design of attractive EVs, HEVs, and PHEVs. 2) Charge sustaining, engine powered hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs) can be designed using either batteries or ultracapacitors with fuel economy improvements of 50% and greater. 3) Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) can be designed with effective all-electric ranges of 30-60 km using lithium-ion batteries that are relatively small. The effective fuel economy of the PHEVs can be very high (greater than 100 mpg) for long daily driving ranges (80-150 km) resulting in a large fraction (greater than 75%) of the energy to power the vehicle being grid electricity. 4) Mild hybrid-electric vehicles (MHEVs) can be designed using ultracapacitors having an energy storage capacity of 75-150 Wh. The fuel economy improvement with the ultracapacitors is 10%-15% higher than with the same weight of batteries due to the higher efficiency of the ultracapacitors and more efficient engine operation. 5) Hybrid-electric vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells can use either batteries or ultracapacitors for energy storage. Simulation results indicate the equivalent fuel economy of the fuel cell powered vehicles is 2-3 times higher than that of a gasoline fueled IC vehicle of the same weight and road load. Compared to an engine-powered HEV, the equivalent fuel economy of the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle would be 1.66-2.0 times higher","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2007.892490","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4168012","Batteries;control strategies;fuel cells;hybrid vehicles;improved fuel economy;ultracapacitors","Supercapacitors;Fuel cell vehicles;Battery powered vehicles;Fuel economy;Energy storage;Hybrid electric vehicles;Engines;Hydrogen;Fuel cells;Vehicle driving","energy storage;fuel cell vehicles;hybrid electric vehicles;internal combustion engines;supercapacitors","fuel cell vehicles;electric energy storage units;battery powered electric vehicle;charge sustaining vehicles;plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles;internal combustion engines;hydrogen fuel cells;primary energy converters;lithium-ion batteries;carbon/carbon ultracapacitors;energy storage technologies;fuel economy","","457","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

BI is a process that includes two primary activities: getting data in and getting data out. Getting data in, traditionally referred to as data warehousing, involves moving data from a set of source systems into an integrated data warehouse. Getting data in delivers limited value to an enterprise; only when users and applications access the data and use it to make decisions does the organization realize the full value from its data warehouse.

Real-time controllers must be simple in order to be implementable with limited computation and memory resources. Moreover, manual tuning of control parameters should be avoided. This article has analyzed two approaches, namely, feedback controllers and ECMS. Both of these approaches can lead to system behavior that is close to optimal, with feedback controllers based on dynamic programming.

"A Transient-Enhanced Low-Quiescent Current Low-Dropout Regulator With Buffer Impedance Attenuation","M. Al-Shyoukh; H. Lee; R. Perez","Texas Instrum. Inc., Dallas; NA; NA","IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","","2007","42","8","1732","1742","This paper presents a low-dropout regulator (LDO) for portable applications with an impedance-attenuated buffer for driving the pass device. Dynamically-biased shunt feedback is proposed in the buffer to lower its output resistance such that the pole at the gate of the pass device is pushed to high frequencies without dissipating large quiescent current. By employing the current-buffer compensation, only a single pole is realized within the regulation loop unity-gain bandwidth and over 65deg phase margin is achieved under the full range of the load current in the LDO. The LDO thus achieves stability without using any low-frequency zero. The maximum output-voltage variation can be minimized during load transients even if a small output capacitor is used.

The Joint Video Team of the ITU-T VCEG and the ISO/IEC MPEG has now also standardized a Scalable Video Coding (SVC) extension of the H.264/AVC standard. SVC enables the transmission and decoding of partial bit streams to provide video services with lower temporal or spatial resolutions or reduced fidelity while retaining a reconstruction quality that is high relative to the rate of the partial bit streams. Hence, SVC provides functionalities such as graceful degradation in lossy transmission environments as well as bit rate, format, and power adaptation. These functionalities provide enhancements to transmission and storage applications. SVC has achieved significant improvements in coding efficiency with an increased degree of supported scalability relative to the scalable profiles of prior video coding standards. This paper provides an overview of the basic concepts for extending H.264/AVC towards SVC.

The need of a high-input voltage represents an important drawback of the half-bridge. The bipolar PWM full bridge requires a lower input voltage but exhibits a low efficiency.

For the first time, DG tunnel FET devices, which are using a high-gate dielectric, are explored using realistic design parameters, showing an on-current as high as 0.23 mA for a gate voltage of 1.8 V, an off-current of less than 1 fA (neglecting gate leakage), an improved average subthreshold swing of 57 mV/dec, and a minimum point slope of 11 mV/dec. The 2D nature of tunnel FET current flow is studied, demonstrating that the current is not confined to a channel at the gate-dielectric surface. When varying temperature, tunnel FETs with a high-kappa gate dielectric have a smaller threshold voltage shift than those using SiO2, while the subthreshold slope for fixed values of Vg remains nearly unchanged, in contrast with the traditional MOSFET. Moreover, an Ion/Ioff ratio of more than 2 times 1011 is shown for simulated devices with a gate length (over the intrinsic region) of 50 nm, which indicates that the tunnel FET is a promising candidate to achieve better-than-ITRS low-standby-power switch performance.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2007.899389","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4252356","Band-to-band tunneling;double gate (DG);gated p-i-n diode;high-$\kappa$ dielectric;subthreshold swing;tunnel field-effect transistor (FET)","","dielectric materials;field effect transistors;tunnelling","voltage 1.8 V;double-gate tunnel FET;high-k gate dielectric;double-gate tunnel field-effect transistor;single-gate devices;gate-dielectric surface;threshold voltage shift;band-to-band tunneling","","768","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Characteristic modes are real current modes that can be computed numerically for conducting bodies of arbitrary shape. Since characteristic modes form a set of orthogonal functions, they can be used to expand the total current on the surface of the body. However, this paper shows that what makes characteristic modes really attractive for antenna design is the physical insight they bring into the radiating phenomena taking place in the antenna. The resonance frequency of modes, as well as their radiating behavior, can be determined from the information provided by the eigenvalues associated with the characteristic modes. Moreover, by studying the current distribution of modes, an optimum feeding arrangement can be found in order to obtain the desired radiating behavior.","1558-4143","","10.1109/MAP.2007.4395295","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4395295","","Antenna theory;Broadband antennas;Microstrip antennas;Mobile antennas;Reflector antennas;Antenna feeds;Telephone sets;Resonance;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Current distribution","antenna theory;broadband antennas;microstrip antennas;monopole antennas","theory of characteristic modes;antenna design;current distribution;optimum feeding arrangement;numerical analysis;broadband antennas;antenna feeds;microstrip antennas;monopole antennas;land mobile radio cellular equipment;handset antennas;reflectarray","","275","","41","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In contrast with the conventional droop-control method, the proposed controller uses resistive output impedance, and as a result, a different control law is obtained. The controller is implemented by using a digital signal processor board, which only uses local measurements of the unit, thus increasing the modularity, reliability, and flexibility of the distributed system.

Currently, the only method for enforcing such policies is to employ a trusted server to store the data and mediate access control. However, if any server storing the data is compromised, then the confidentiality of the data will be compromised. In this paper we present a system for realizing complex access control on encrypted data that we call ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption. By using our techniques encrypted data can be kept confidential even if the storage server is untrusted; moreover, our methods are secure against collusion attacks. Previous attribute-based encryption systems used attributes to describe the encrypted data and built policies into user's keys; while in our system attributes are used to describe a user's credentials, and a party encrypting data determines a policy for who can decrypt. Thus, our methods are conceptually closer to traditional access control methods such as role-based access control (RBAC). In addition, we provide an implementation of our system and give performance measurements.","2375-1207","0-7695-2848-1","10.1109/SP.2007.11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4223236","","Cryptography;Access control;Secure storage;Measurement;Personnel;File servers;Monitoring;Certification;Data security;Public key","authorisation;cryptography;distributed processing;storage management","ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption;distributed system;policy enforcement;data confidentiality;trusted storage server;collusion attack;role-based access control","","1639","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An energy storage device such as an electric double layer capacitor is directly connected to a dc side of the dc-dc converter without any chopper circuit. Nevertheless, the dc-dc converter can continue operating when the voltage across the energy storage device drops along with its discharge. Theoretical calculation and experimental measurement reveal that power loss and peak current impose limitations on a permissible dc-voltage range. This information may be useful in design of the dc-dc converter. Experimental results verify proper charging and discharging operation obtained from a 200-V, 2.6-kJ laboratory model of the energy storage system. Moreover, the dc-dc converter can charge the capacitor bank from zero to the rated voltage without any external precharging circuit.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2007.909248","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4371545","Bidirectional isolated dc-dc converter;electric double layer capacitors;energy storage system;loss analysis;starting procedure","Energy storage;Galvanizing;DC-DC power converters;Circuits;Voltage;Supercapacitors;Choppers;Current measurement;Power measurement;Loss measurement","choppers (circuits);DC-DC power convertors;energy storage","voltage 200 V;energy 2.6 kJ;bidirectional dc dc converter;energy storage system;galvanic isolation;electric double layer capacitor;chopper circuit;power loss;peak current;permissible dc voltage range;voltage 200 V;energy 2.6 kJ","","376","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Sci., Michigan Univ., Ann Arbor, MI; NA","IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","","2007","55","5","1239","1245","We demonstrate a new class of bandpass frequency selective surface (FSS), the building block of which, unlike the traditional FSSs, makes use of resonant dipole and slot structures that have dimensions much smaller than the operating wavelength. This design allows localization of bandpass characteristics to within a small area on the surface which in turn facilitates flexible spatial filtering for an arbitrary wave phasefront. The proposed FSS is made up of periodic array of metallic patches separated by thin air-gaps backed by a wire mesh having the same periodicity (Ltlambda). The array of metallic patches constitute a capacitive surface and the wire mesh a coupled inductive surface, which together act as a resonant structure in the path of an incident plane wave. Like traditional FSSs, the capacitive and inductive surfaces of the proposed FSS can easily be fabricated using printed circuit technology on both sides of microwave substrates. It is shown that by cascading such bandpass surfaces in a proper fashion, any arbitrary multipole filter or non-commensurate multiband response can be obtained. The frequency response of the proposed miniaturized-element frequency selective surface (MEFSS) is demonstrated for various incident angles and it is shown that one-pole designs are less sensitive than two-pole designs to the angle of incidence. Dual band designs are also possible based on two-pole designs, but are more sensitive to incident angle than single band designs because of their larger (in terms of wavelengths) spacing. Prototypes of single-pole and dual-pole MEFSSs are fabricated and tested in a waveguide environment at X-band frequencies and excellent agreements between the measured and simulated results are demonstrated","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2007.895567","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4200922","Bandpass radome;frequency selective surfaces (FSSs);spatial filter","Frequency selective surfaces;Surface waves;Resonance;Band pass filters;Wire;Filtering;Air gaps;Coupling circuits;Printed circuits;Microwave technology","dipole antenna arrays;frequency response;frequency selective surfaces;microstrip antenna arrays;multifrequency antennas;printed circuits;slot antenna arrays;spatial filters;substrates","frequency selective surface;bandpass FSS;miniaturized element;MEFSS;resonant dipole;slot structure;spatial filtering;arbitrary wave phasefront;metallic patch periodic array;printed circuit technology;microwave substrate;frequency response;dual band design;waveguide environment;X-band frequency","","327","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First is a wide utilization of renewable power resources. The second is decentralization of power generation. Hence, small power sources, very often RES sources, called dissipated power generators are developed. They are usually in range of megawatts starting form kilowatts. They operate automatically and are remotely controlled. In fact the sources are electronic devices. Microprocessor control units are used to control power production and perform remote control and power electronic converters are used to control power flow. So, many different kinds of power electronic devices are required. Another political and social trend is local balancing of power production and power consumption. It means that all power consumed in some are should be generated in the area. Hence small power systems are developed called microgrids. Microgrids consist of power sources, loads, control units and lines, like normal public grid. But the microgrid is limited to the small area, i.e. village, town, and automatically controlled. Again power electronic devices and control units decide about the microgrid performances. Development of required devices, both power electronic and controllers, are possible only with close cooperation of research units, like Warsaw University of Technology, and production firms, like APS Energia. APS Energia offers many power electronic converters and complete power plant and control and supervisory remote controllers for power industry. Some are especially developed for dissipated generation. The University's researchers design some devices and their principles of operation. APS Energia produces the devices. The main, presented in the paper are inverter with MPP tracking for PV systems, inverters for supplying AC loads from DC power systems, PEM fuel cell power generation units, battery chargers, high power inverters and rectifiers with sinusoidal input current, synchronization systems and remote control and monitoring devices.

For a general class of vehicles moving in either 2- or 3-D space, we demonstrate how adaptive switching supervisory control can be combined with a nonlinear Lyapunov-based tracking control law to solve the problem of global boundedness and convergence of the position tracking error to a neighborhood of the origin that can be made arbitrarily small. The desired trajectory does not need to be of a particular type (e.g., trimming trajectories) and can be any sufficiently smooth bounded curve parameterized by time. We also show how these results can be applied to solve the path-following problem, in which the vehicle is required to converge to and follow a path, without a specific temporal specification. We illustrate our design procedures through two vehicle control applications: a hovercraft (moving on a planar surface) and an underwater vehicle (moving in 3-D space).

The first algorithm is a modification of a previous DKF algorithm presented by the author in CDC-ECC '05. The previous algorithm was only applicable to sensors with identical observation matrices which meant the process had to be observable by every sensor. The modified DKF algorithm uses two identical consensus filters for fusion of the sensor data and covariance information and is applicable to sensor networks with different observation matrices. This enables the sensor network to act as a collective observer for the processes occurring in an environment. Then, we introduce a continuous-time distributed Kalman filter that uses local aggregation of the sensor data but attempts to reach a consensus on estimates with other nodes in the network. This peer-to-peer distributed estimation method gives rise to two iterative distributed Kalman filtering algorithms with different consensus strategies on estimates. Communication complexity and packet-loss issues are discussed. The performance and effectiveness of these distributed Kalman filtering algorithms are compared and demonstrated on a target tracking task.","0191-2216","978-1-4244-1497-0","10.1109/CDC.2007.4434303","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4434303","sensor networks;distributed Kalman filtering;consensus filtering;sensor fusion","Kalman filters;Filtering algorithms;Covariance matrix;Sensor fusion;Peer to peer computing;Information filtering;Information filters;Iterative methods;Complexity theory;Target tracking","communication complexity;continuous time filters;covariance matrices;distributed algorithms;distributed tracking;iterative methods;Kalman filters;sensor fusion;wireless sensor networks","iterative distributed Kalman filtering algorithm;wireless sensor network;sensor data fusion;covariance matrix;collective observer;continuous-time distributed Kalman filter;peer-to-peer distributed estimation method;consensus filter strategy;communication complexity;packet-loss issue;target tracking task","","673","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The control schemes in the paper include a pitch angle control for the wind turbine and a speed control for the generator. The pitch angle control uses wind speeds and electric power output as the input signals to ensure normal operation in high wind speed. The speed control is realized through field orientation where the d-axis current is set to zero and the q-axis current is used to control the rotational speed of the generator according to the variation of wind speed.

A DFIG system model in the positive and negative synchronous reference frames is presented. Variations of stator active and reactive powers and generator torque are fully defined in the presence of negative sequence voltage and current. Alternative DFIG control targets during network unbalance, such as reducing stator current unbalance, torque, and power pulsations minimization, are identified. A rotor current control strategy based on positive and negative (dq) reference frames is used to provide precise control of the rotor positive and negative sequence currents. Simulation results using EMTDC/PSCAD are presented for a 2-MW DFIG wind generation system. It shows that conventional vector control of DFIG without considering network unbalance results in excessive oscillations on the stator active/reactive power, electromagnetic torque, and stator/rotor currents even with a small stator voltage unbalance.

First, the textures are modeled with volume local binary patterns (VLBP), which are an extension of the LBP operator widely used in ordinary texture analysis, combining motion and appearance. To make the approach computationally simple and easy to extend, only the co-occurrences of the local binary patterns on three orthogonal planes (LBP-TOP) are then considered. A block-based method is also proposed to deal with specific dynamic events such as facial expressions in which local information and its spatial locations should also be taken into account. In experiments with two DT databases, DynTex and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), both the VLBP and LBP-TOP clearly outperformed the earlier approaches.

Push-pull output stage is introduced to enhance the output driving ability. Small dropout voltage (Vbo) with large-size pass transistor and ultra-low Iq can thus be used to minimize power loss of LDO regulator without transient-response degradation. The proposed amplifier helps to improve stability of LDO regulators without using any on-chip and off-chip compensation capacitors. This is beneficial to chip-level power management requiring high-area efficiency. An LDO regulator with the proposed amplifier has been implemented in a 0.18- mum standard CMOS process and occupies 0.09 mm2.

Even though the OFDMA concept is simple in its basic principle, the design of a practical OFDMA system is far from being a trivial task. Synchronization represents one of the most challenging issues and plays a major role in the physical layer design. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey of the latest results in the field of synchronization for OFDMA systems, with tutorial objectives foremost. After quantifying the effects of synchronization errors on the system performance, we review some common methods to achieve timing and frequency alignment in a downlink transmission. We then consider the uplink case, where synchronization is made particularly difficult by the fact that each user's signal is characterized by different timing and frequency errors, and the base station has thus to estimate a relatively large number of unknown parameters. A second difficulty is related to how the estimated parameters must be employed to correct the uplink timing and frequency errors. The paper concludes with a comparison of the reviewed synchronization schemes in an OFDMA scenario inspired by the IEEE 802.16 standard for wireless metropolitan area networks.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2007.897979","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4287203","Downlink synchronization;dynamic subcarrier assignment;frequency correction;frequency estimation;interblock interference (IBI);interchannel interference (ICI);interference cancellation;least square estimation;maximum likelihood estimation;multicarrier modulation;multiple access interference (MAI);multiuser detection;orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA);orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM);quasi-synchronous systems;subspace-based estimation;timing correction;timing estimation;uplink synchronization;wireless local area networks (WLANs);wireless metropolitan area networks (WMANs)","Tutorial;Frequency synchronization;Frequency conversion;Frequency estimation;Timing;Physical layer;System performance;Downlink;Base stations;Parameter estimation","frequency division multiple access;multimedia communication;OFDM modulation;radio links;synchronisation;WiMax","synchronization techniques;orthogonal frequency division multiple access;OFDMA;physical layer design;frequency alignment;downlink transmission;IEEE 802.16 standard;wireless metropolitan area networks;multimedia services;tutorial review;timing alignment;uplink transmission;broadband wireless access","","474","","67","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As neuroprosthetic devices transition from experimental to clinical use, there is a need for fully-implantable amplification and telemetry electronics in close proximity to the recording sites. To address these needs, we developed a prototype integrated circuit for wireless neural recording from a 100-channel microelectrode array. The design of both the system-level architecture and the individual circuits were driven by severe power constraints for small implantable devices; chronically heating tissue by only a few degrees Celsius leads to cell death. Due to the high data rate produced by 100 neural signals, the system must perform data reduction as well. We use a combination of a low-power ADC and an array of ""spike detectors"" to reduce the transmitted data rate while preserving critical information.

NFPs represent the ensemble activity of thousands of neurons and code-useful information for both normal activity and disease states. NFPs are small - of the order of tens of muV- and reside at low bandwidths that make them susceptible to excess noise. Therefore, to ensure the highest fidelity of signal measurement for diagnostic analysis, the amplifier is chopper-stabilized to eliminate 1/f and popcorn noise. The circuit was prototyped in an 0.8 mum CMOS process and consumes under 2.0 muW from a 1.8 V supply. A noise floor of 0.98 muVrms was achieved over a bandwidth from 0.05 to 100 Hz; the noise-efficiency factor of 4.6 is one of the lowest published to date. A flexible on-chip high-pass filter is used to suppress front-end electrode offsets while maintaining relevant physiological data. The monolithic architect and micropower low-noise low-supply operation could help enable applications ranging from neuroprosthetics to seizure monitors that require a small form factor and battery operation.

To realize these gains, however, the BS should be informed with the user's channel coefficients, which may limit practical application to TDD or low-mobility settings.

Optimizing the power efficiency of the wireless link is imperative to minimize the size of the external energy source, heating dissipation in the tissue, and interference with other devices. Previous design methodologies for coils made of 1-D filaments are not comprehensive and accurate enough to consider all geometrical aspects of PSCs with planar 3-D conductors as well as design constraints imposed by implantable device application and fabrication technology. We have outlined the theoretical foundation of optimal power transmission efficiency in an inductive link, and combined it with semi-empirical models to predict parasitic components in PSCs.

We have executed this procedure on two design examples at 1 and 5 MHz achieving power transmission efficiencies of 41.2% and 85.8%, respectively, at 10-mm spacing.

Most of the RFID networks include a wide range of automation technologies. These technologies are RFID readers, RFID writers, RFID barcode scanners, RFID smart sensors and RFID controllers. In this study, a solution has been provided for the problems encountered in parking-lot management systems via RFID technology. RFID readers, RFID labels, computers, barriers and software are used as for the main components of the RFID technology. The software has been handled for the management, controlling, transaction reporting and operation tasks for parking lots located on various parts of the city. Check-ins and check-outs of the parking-lots will be under control with RFID readers, labels and barriers. Personnel costs will be reduced considerably using this technology. It will be possible to see unmanned, secure, automized parking-lots functioning with RFID technology in the future. Check-ins and check-outs will be handled in a fast manner without having to stop the cars so that traffic jam problem will be avoided during these processes. Drivers will not have to stop at the circulation points and parking tickets will be out of usage during check-ins and check-outs. It will be avoided ticket-jamming problems for the ticket processing machines as well. Vehicle owners will not have to make any payments at each check-out thus a faster traffic flow will be possible. Since there won't be any waiting during check-ins and check-outs the formation of emission gas as a result of such waiting will be avoided. An automized income tracking system, a car tracking system for charging and a central parking-car tracking system have been developed and utilized.

To date, most cognitive radio research has focused on policy-based radios that are hard-coded with a list of rules on how the radio should behave in certain scenarios. Some work has been done on radios with learning engines tailored for very specific applications. This article describes a concrete model for a generic cognitive radio to utilize a learning engine. The goal is to incorporate the results of the learning engine into a predicate calculus-based reasoning engine so that radios can remember lessons learned in the past and act quickly in the future. We also investigate the differences between reasoning and learning, and the fundamentals of when a particular application requires learning, and when simple reasoning is sufficient. The basic architecture is consistent with cognitive engines seen in AI research. The focus of this article is not to propose new machine learning algorithms, but rather to formalize their application to cognitive radio and develop a framework from within which they can be useful.

Several strategies to select the current reference are studied and compared using experimental results that are obtained during an unsymmetrical voltage fault.

As dc circuit breakers are expensive, this paper proposes a solution based on extinguishing the dc fault current by opening all the ac-circuit breakers (ac-CBs) which the VSCs are already equipped with on the ac-sides. However, it is necessary to identify which dc line is the faulted line (in case it is a permanent fault) so that it can be isolated by fast dc switches (which are much more economical than the dc circuit breakers), prior to restoring the MTDC system by re-closing all the ac-CBs.

It is found that isolations of more than -20 dB can be achieved between two parallel individual planar inverted-F antennas (PIFAs) sharing a common ground plane, with inter-antenna spacing (center to center) of 0.116 lambdao and ground plane size 0.331lambdao 2. At 2.31 GHz it is demonstrated that this translates into an edge to edge separation between antennas of just 10 mm. Similarly the structure can be applied to reduce mutual coupling between three or four radiating elements. In addition the mutual coupling between half wavelength patches and monopoles can also be reduced with the aid of the proposed ground plane structure.

The active digital phase shifters synthesize the required phase using a phase interpolation process by adding quadrature-phased input signals. The designs are based on a resonance-based quadrature all-pass filter for quadrature signaling with minimum loss and wide operation bandwidth. Both phase shifters can change phases with less than about 2 dB of RMS amplitude imbalance for all phase states through an associated DAC control. For the X- and Ku-band phase shifter, the RMS phase error is less than 10o over the entire 5-18 GHz range. The average insertion loss ranges from to at 5-20 GHz. The input for all 4-bit phase states is typically at -5.4 plusmn1.3 GHz in the X- and Ku-band phase shifter. The K-band phase shifter exhibits 6.5-13 of RMS phase error at 15-26 GHz. The average insertion loss is from 4.6 to at 15-26 GHz. The input of the K-band phase shifter is at 24 GHz. For both phase shifters, the core size excluding all the pads and the output 50 Omega matching circuits, inserted for measurement purpose only, is very small, 0.33times0.43 mm2 . The total current consumption is 5.8 mA in the X- and Ku-band phase shifter and 7.8 mA in the K-band phase shifter, from a 1.5 V supply voltage.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2007.907225","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4362098","Active phase shifters;CMOS analog integrated circuits;phased arrays;quadrature networks","Phase shifters;K-band;CMOS technology;Phased arrays;Insertion loss;Digital control;Radio frequency;CMOS digital integrated circuits;Integrated circuit technology;Integrated circuit synthesis","all-pass filters;antenna phased arrays;CMOS analogue integrated circuits;microwave antenna arrays;MMIC phase shifters","voltage 1.5 V;current 7.8 mA;current 5.8 mA;size 0.13 mum;frequency 18 GHz to 26 GHz;frequency 8 GHz to 18 GHz;matching circuits;DAC control;quadrature signaling;resonance-based quadrature all-pass filter;quadrature-phased input signals;phase interpolation process;active digital phase shifters;digital control circuitry;K-band phased arrays;Kmu-band phased arrays;X-band phased arrays;CMOS phase shifters;frequency 8 GHz to 18 GHz;frequency 18 GHz to 26 GHz;size 0.13 mum;current 5.8 mA;current 7.8 mA;voltage 1.5 V","","202","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These problems can be cast as -regularized least-squares programs (LSPs), which can be reformulated as convex quadratic programs, and then solved by several standard methods such as interior-point methods, at least for small and medium size problems. In this paper, we describe a specialized interior-point method for solving large-scale -regularized LSPs that uses the preconditioned conjugate gradients algorithm to compute the search direction. The interior-point method can solve large sparse problems, with a million variables and observations, in a few tens of minutes on a PC. It can efficiently solve large dense problems, that arise in sparse signal recovery with orthogonal transforms, by exploiting fast algorithms for these transforms.

Network protocol stacks may instead be holistically analyzed and systematically designed as distributed solutions to some global optimization problems. This paper presents a survey of the recent efforts towards a systematic understanding of layering as optimization decomposition, where the overall communication network is modeled by a generalized network utility maximization problem, each layer corresponds to a decomposed subproblem, and the interfaces among layers are quantified as functions of the optimization variables coordinating the subproblems. There can be many alternative decompositions, leading to a choice of different layering architectures. This paper surveys the current status of horizontal decomposition into distributed computation, and vertical decomposition into functional modules such as congestion control, routing, scheduling, random access, power control, and channel coding. Key messages and methods arising from many recent works are summarized, and open issues discussed. Through case studies, it is illustrated how layering as Optimization Decomposition provides a common language to think about modularization in the face of complex, networked interactions, a unifying, top-down approach to design protocol stacks, and a mathematical theory of network architectures","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2006.887322","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4118456","Ad hoc network;channel coding;computer network;congestion control;cross-layer design;distributed algorithm;feedback control;game theory;Internet;Lagrange duality;medium access control (MAC);network utility maximization (NUM);optimization;power control;r everse-engineering;routing;scheduling;stochastic networks;transmission control protocol (TCP)/Internet protocol (IP);wireless communications","Protocols;Design optimization;Cross layer design;Communication networks;Utility programs;Computer architecture;Distributed computing;Routing;Processor scheduling;Power control","optimisation;protocols;telecommunication networks","optimization decomposition;network architectures;network protocol stacks;horizontal decomposition;distributed computation;vertical decomposition;congestion control;network routing;scheduling;random access;power control;channel coding;ad hoc network;computer network;cross-layer design;distributed algorithm;feedback control;game theory;Internet;Lagrange duality;medium access control;network utility maximization;reverse-engineering;stochastic networks;transmission control protocol;lnternet protocol;wireless communications","","828","","170","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This approach uses a particle filter in which each particle carries an individual map of the environment. Accordingly, a key question is how to reduce the number of particles. In this paper, we present adaptive techniques for reducing this number in a RBPF for learning grid maps. We propose an approach to compute an accurate proposal distribution, taking into account not only the movement of the robot, but also the most recent observation. This drastically decreases the uncertainty about the robot's pose in the prediction step of the filter. Furthermore, we present an approach to selectively carry out resampling operations, which seriously reduces the problem of particle depletion.

One limiting factor to the use of FMCW sensors is the well-known presence of nonlinearities in the transmitted signal. This results in contrast- and range-resolution degradation, particularly when the system is intended for high-resolution long-range applications, as it is the case for SAR. This paper presents a novel processing solution, which solves the nonlinearity problem for the whole range profile. Additionally, the conventional stop-and-go approximation used in pulse-radar algorithms is not valid in FMCW SAR applications under certain circumstances. Therefore, the motion within the sweep needs to be taken into account. Analytical development of the FMCW SAR signal model, starting from the deramped signal and without using the stop-and-go approximation, is presented in this paper. The model is then applied to stripmap, spotlight, and single-transmitter/multiple-receiver digital-beamforming SAR operational mode. The proposed algorithms are verified by processing real FMCW SAR data collected with the demonstrator system built at the Delft University of Technology.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2007.906140","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4373378","Doppler frequency correction;frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW);nonlinearity correction;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Signal processing;Signal processing algorithms;Radar signal processing;Frequency;Synthetic aperture radar;High-resolution imaging;Image sensors;Image resolution;Signal resolution;Limiting","geophysical signal processing;geophysical techniques;image sensors;radar imaging;synthetic aperture radar","signal processing;frequency-modulated continuous-wave technology;FMCW technique;synthetic aperture radar;SAR technique;high resolution image sensor;signal transmission;conventional stop-and-go approximation;pulse-radar algorithms;data collection;Delft University of Technology;signal model;Netherlands","","187","","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recognizing hardware and energy constraints, we assume that a secondary user may not be able to perform full-spectrum sensing or may not be willing to monitor the spectrum when it has no data to transmit. We develop an analytical framework for opportunistic spectrum access based on the theory of partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). This decision-theoretic approach integrates the design of spectrum access protocols at the MAC layer with spectrum sensing at the physical layer and traffic statistics determined by the application layer of the primary network. It also allows easy incorporation of spectrum sensing error and constraint on the probability of colliding with the primary users. Under this POMDP framework, we propose cognitive MAC protocols that optimize the performance of secondary users while limiting the interference perceived by primary users. A suboptimal strategy with reduced complexity yet comparable performance is developed.

The objective of HEV control is in fact to find out the sequence of optimal power splits at each instant of time that minimizes the fuel consumption over a given driving schedule.

The method uses a time series of observed and predicted 15-min average wind speeds at foreseen onshore- and offshore-wind farm locations. A Unit Commitment and Economic Dispatch (UC-ED) tool is adapted to allow for frequent revisions of conventional generation unit schedules, using information on current wind energy output and forecasts for the next 36 h. This is deemed the most faithful way of simulating actual operations and short-term planning activities for a system with large wind power penetration. The problem formulation includes ramp-rate constraints for generation schedules and for reserve activation, and minimum up-time and down-time of conventional units. Results are shown for a realistic future scenario of the Dutch power system. It is shown that problems such as insufficient regulating and reserve power-which are typically associated with the variability and limited predictability of wind power-can only be assessed in conjunction with the specifics of the conventional generation system that wind power is integrated into. For the thermal system with a large share of combined heat and power (CHP) investigated here, wind power forecasting does not provide significant benefits for optimal unit commitment and dispatch.

Better utilization of the Microgrid is achieved by solving power flow and power quality issues using p-q theory-based active filtering called universal active power line conditioner and unified power quality conditioner, respectively. A distributed intelligent energy management system (DIEMS) is implemented to optimize operating costs. As the optimization greatly depends on the power generation and the power output from renewable sources strongly depends on the weather, the forecast of power generation is required for DIEMS. A Fuzzy ARTMAP neural network is used to predict hourly day-type outputs based on which generation can be forecasted.

To further improve query performance, we add an efficient spatial verification stage to re-rank the results returned from our bag-of-words model and show that this consistently improves search quality, though by less of a margin when the visual vocabulary is large.

We have implemented a low-power and low-noise readout front-end with configurable characteristics for Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electrocardiogram (ECG), and Electromyogram (EMG) signals. Key to its performance is the new AC-coupled chopped instrumentation amplifier (ACCIA), which uses a low power current feedback instrumentation amplifier (IA). Thus, while chopping filters the 1/f noise of CMOS transistors and increases the CMRR, AC coupling is capable of rejecting differential electrode offset (DEO) up to plusmn50 mV from conventional Ag/AgCl electrodes. The ACCIA achieves 120 dB CMRR and 57 nV/radicHz input-referred voltage noise density, while consuming 11.1 muA from a 3 V supply. The chopping spike filter (CSF) stage filters the chopping spikes generated by the input chopper of ACCIA and the digitally controllable variable gain stage is used to set the gain and the bandwidth of the front-end.

It is based on a Markov-chain model of random walk through the database. More precisely, we compute quantities (the average commute time, the pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrix of the graph, etc.) that provide similarities between any pair of nodes, having the nice property of increasing when the number of paths connecting those elements increases and when the ""length"" of paths decreases. It turns out that the square root of the average commute time is a Euclidean distance and that the pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrix is a kernel matrix (its elements are inner products closely related to commute times). A principal component analysis (PCA) of the graph is introduced for computing the subspace projection of the node vectors in a manner that preserves as much variance as possible in terms of the Euclidean commute-time distance. This graph PCA provides a nice interpretation to the ""Fiedler vector,"" widely used for graph partitioning. The model is evaluated on a collaborative-recommendation task where suggestions are made about which movies people should watch based upon what they watched in the past. Experimental results on the MovieLens database show that the Laplacian-based similarities perform well in comparison with other methods. The model, which nicely fits into the so-called ""statistical relational learning"" framework, could also be used to compute document or word similarities, and, more generally, it could be applied to machine-learning and pattern-recognition tasks involving a relational database","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2007.46","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4072747","Graph analysis;graph and database mining;collaborative recommendation;graph kernels;spectral clustering;Fiedler vector;proximity measures;statistical relational learning.","Collaboration;Principal component analysis;Laplace equations;Relational databases;Collaborative work;Joining processes;Euclidean distance;Kernel;Motion pictures;Watches","graph theory;information filtering;Markov processes;principal component analysis;relational databases","random-walk computation;collaborative recommendation;relational database;undirected graph theory;Markov-chain model;Laplacian matrix algebra;Euclidean distance;principal component analysis;graph partitioning;statistical relational learning framework","","534","","67","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

After conducting an extensive review of Infovis systems and their interactive capabilities, we propose seven general categories of interaction techniques widely used in Infovis: 1) Select, 2) Explore, 3) Reconfigure, 4) Encode, 5) Abstract/Elaborate, 6) Filter, and 7) Connect. These categories are organized around a user's intent while interacting with a system rather than the low-level interaction techniques provided by a system.

This provides a method of inhibiting background clutter and adding invariance to the object instance 's position; and (iii) the use of random forests (and random ferns) as a multi-way classifier. The advantage of such classifiers (over multi-way SVM for example) is the ease of training and testing. Results are reported for classification of the Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 data sets. We compare the performance of the random forest/ferns classifier with a benchmark multi-way SVM classifier.

For example, in text clustering, clusters of documents of different topics are categorized by different subsets of terms or keywords. The keywords for one cluster may not occur in the documents of other clusters. This is a data sparsity problem faced in clustering high-dimensional data. In the new algorithm, we extend the k-means clustering process to calculate a weight for each dimension in each cluster and use the weight values to identify the subsets of important dimensions that categorize different clusters. This is achieved by including the weight entropy in the objective function that is minimized in the k-means clustering process. An additional step is added to the k-means clustering process to automatically compute the weights of all dimensions in each cluster. The experiments on both synthetic and real data have shown that the new algorithm can generate better clustering results than other subspace clustering algorithms.

The growing pressure, primarily driven by environmental concerns, for generating more electricity from renewables and improving energy efficiency have promoted the application of DER into electricity systems. So far, DER have been used to displace energy from conventional generating plants but not to displace their capacity as they are not visible to system operators. If this continues, this will lead to problematic over-capacity issues and under-utilisation of the assets, reduce overall system efficiency and eventually increase the electricity cost that needs to be paid by society. The concept of VPP was developed to enhance the visibility and control of DER to system operators and other market actors by providing an appropriate interface between these system components.

In the proposed topology, a three-winding coupled inductor is used for providing a high voltage gain without extreme switch duty-cycle and enhancing the utility rate of magnetic core. Moreover, the energy in the leakage inductor is released directly to the output terminal for avoiding the phenomenon of circulating current and the production of switch surge voltage. In addition, the delay time formed with the cross of primary and secondary currents of the coupled inductor is manipulated to alleviate the reverse-recovery current of the output diode. It can achieve the aim of high-efficiency power conversion. Furthermore, the closed-loop control methodology is utilized in the proposed scheme to overcome the voltage drift problem of the power source under the variation of loads. Some experimental results via an example of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell power source with 250-W nominal rating are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed power conversion strategy","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2006.888794","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4084723","DC-DC converter;coupled inductor;fuel cell;proton exchange membrane;reverse recovery","Switches;DC-DC power converters;Switching converters;Voltage;Stress;Inductors;Surges;Power conversion;Topology;Couplings","closed loop systems;DC-DC power convertors;magnetic cores;power inductors;proton exchange membrane fuel cells","DC-DC converter;voltage gain;reduced switch stress;coupled inductor;conventional boost converter;switch surge voltage;leakage inductor;high-voltage-rated devices;three-winding coupled inductor;magnetic core utility rate;circulating current phenomenon;delay time;primary currents;secondary currents;reverse-recovery current;high-efficiency power conversion;closed-loop control methodology;voltage drift problem;proton exchange membrane fuel cell power source;250 W","","279","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A key step forward is the realization that in mobile handsets, it is enough to receive one channel with any bandwidth, situated in any band. Thus, the front-end can be tuned electronically. Taking a cue from a digital front-end, the receiver's flexible analog baseband samples the channel of interest at zero IF, and is followed by clock-programmable downsampling with embedded filtering. This gives a tunable selectivity that exceeds that of an RF prefilter, and a conversion rate that is low enough for A/D conversion at only milliwatts. The front-end consists of a wideband low noise amplifier and a mixer tunable by a wideband LO.

The amplifier appears to be the lowest power and most energy-efficient neural recording amplifier reported to date. We describe low-noise design techniques that help the neural amplifier achieve input-referred noise that is near the theoretical limit of any amplifier using a differential pair as an input stage. Since neural amplifiers must include differential input pairs in practice to allow robust rejection of common-mode and power supply noise, our design appears to be near the optimum allowed by theory. The bandwidth of the amplifier can be adjusted for recording either neural spikes or local field potentials (LFPs). When configured for recording neural spikes, the amplifier yielded a midband gain of 40.8 dB and a -3-dB bandwidth from 45 Hz to 5.32 kHz; the amplifier's input-referred noise was measured to be 3.06 muVrms while consuming 7.56 muW of power from a 2.8-V supply corresponding to a noise efficiency factor (NEF) of 2.67 with the theoretical limit being 2.02. When configured for recording LFPs, the amplifier achieved a midband gain of 40.9 dB and a -3-dB bandwidth from 392 mHz to 295 Hz; the input-referred noise was 1.66 muVrms while consuming 2.08 muW from a 2.8-V supply corresponding to an NEF of 3.21. The amplifier was fabricated in AMI's 0.5-mum CMOS process and occupies 0.16 mm2 of chip area.

Univ. of Ireland, Galway; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","","2007","54","5","2550","2557","State-of-charge (SOC) determination is an increasingly important issue in battery technology. In addition to the immediate display of the remaining battery capacity to the user, precise knowledge of SOC exerts additional control over the charging/discharging process, which can be employed to increase battery life. This reduces the risk of overvoltage and gassing, which degrade the chemical composition of the electrolyte and plates. The proposed model in this paper determines the SOC by incorporating the changes occurring due to terminal voltage, current load, and internal resistance, which mitigate the disadvantages of using impedance only. Electromotive force (EMF) voltage is predicted while the battery is under load conditions; from the estimated EMF voltage, the SOC is then determined. The method divides the battery voltage curve into two regions: 1) the linear region for full to partial SOC and 2) the hyperbolic region from partial to low SOC. Algorithms are developed to correspond to the different characteristic changes occurring within each region. In the hyperbolic region, the rate of change in impedance and terminal voltage is greater than that in the linear region. The magnitude of current discharge causes varying rates of change to the terminal voltage and impedance. Experimental tests and results are presented to validate the new models.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2007.899926","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4285705","$C$ rate;electromotive force (EMF) voltage;impedance;lead-acid battery;lithium-ion battery;state of charge (SOC);terminal voltage","Batteries;State estimation;Impedance;Kinetic theory;Power engineering and energy;Mathematical model;Chemical technology;Displays;Voltage control;Degradation","electric impedance;lead acid batteries","state-of-charge determination;EMF voltage estimation;impedance;lead-acid batteries;lithium-ion batteries;SOC determination;charging/discharging process;current load;internal resistance","","249","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Univ. of Lisbon, Lisboa","IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","","2007","16","12","2992","3004","Iterative shrinkage/thresholding (1ST) algorithms have been recently proposed to handle a class of convex unconstrained optimization problems arising in image restoration and other linear inverse problems. This class of problems results from combining a linear observation model with a nonquadratic regularizer (e.g., total variation or wavelet-based regularization). It happens that the convergence rate of these 1ST algorithms depends heavily on the linear observation operator, becoming very slow when this operator is ill-conditioned or ill-posed. In this paper, we introduce two-step 1ST (TwIST) algorithms, exhibiting much faster convergence rate than 1ST for ill-conditioned problems. For a vast class of nonquadratic convex regularizers (lscrP norms, some Besov norms, and total variation), we show that TwIST converges to a minimizer of the objective function, for a given range of values of its parameters. For noninvertible observation operators, we introduce a monotonic version of TwIST (MTwIST); although the convergence proof does not apply to this scenario, we give experimental evidence that MTwIST exhibits similar speed gains over IST. The effectiveness of the new methods are experimentally confirmed on problems of image deconvolution and of restoration with missing samples.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2007.909319","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4358846","Convex analysis;image deconvolution;image restoration;non-smooth optimization;optimization;regularization;total variation;wavelets;Convex analysis;image deconvolution;image restoration;non-smooth optimization;optimization;regularization;total variation;wavelets","Iterative algorithms;Image restoration;Inverse problems;Convergence;Deconvolution;Lips;Image analysis;Wavelet analysis;Image processing;Remote sensing","convergence;image restoration;image segmentation;inverse problems;iterative methods;optimisation;wavelet transforms","iterative shrinkage;image thresholding algorithm;convex unconstrained optimization problem;image restoration;linear inverse problem;linear observation model;nonquadratic regularizer;TwIST algorithm;image segmentation","Algorithms;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","922","","50","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When static obstacles popup during the flight, the UAVs are required to steer around them and also avoid collisions between each other. In order to achieve these goals, a new dual-mode control strategy is proposed: a ""safe mode"" is defined as an operation in an obstacle-free environment and a ""danger mode"" is activated when there is a chance of collision or when there are obstacles in the path. Safe mode achieves global optimization because the dynamics of all the UAVs participating in the formation are taken into account in the controller formulation. In the danger mode, a novel algorithm using a modified Grossberg neural network (GNN) is proposed for obstacle/collision avoidance. This decentralized algorithm in 2-D uses the geometry of the flight space to generate optimal/suboptimal trajectories. Extension of the proposed scheme for obstacle avoidance in a 3-D environment is shown. In order to handle practical vehicle constraints, a model predictive control-based tracking controller is used to track the references generated. Numerical results are provided to motivate this approach and to demonstrate its potential.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2007.899191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4252107","Collision avoidance;cooperative control;Grossberg neural network (GNN);model predictive control (MPC);obstacle avoidance;unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV);visibility graph","Unmanned aerial vehicles;Collision avoidance;Predictive models;Radar tracking;Neural networks;Predictive control;Nuclear power generation;Vehicle dynamics;Geometry;Fires","aircraft control;collision avoidance;geometry;mobile robots;navigation;neurocontrollers;predictive control;remotely operated vehicles;tracking","tracking controller;model predictive control;vehicle constraints;flight space geometry;decentralized algorithm;modified Grossberg neural network;global optimization;danger mode;safe mode;dual-mode control strategy;navigation problems;collision avoidance;obstacle avoidance;cooperative UAV formation flying","","200","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the forward sweep, the voltage at each downstream bus is then updated by the real and imaginary components of the calculated bus voltage multiplying with the corresponding ratio.

However, since it can produce energy only at a limited rate, energy saving mechanisms play an important role to reduce energy consumption in a sensor node. In this article we present an overview of the different energy harvesting technologies and the energy saving mechanisms for wireless sensor networks. The related research issues on energy efficiency for sensor networks using energy harvesting technology are then discussed. To this end, we present an optimal energy management policy for a solar-powered sensor node that uses a sleep and wakeup strategy for energy conservation.

The proposed approach could be used by vertically integrated utilities as well as the ISOs in electricity markets. In this model, random disturbances, such as outages of generation units and transmission lines as well as load forecasting inaccuracies, are modeled as scenario trees using the Monte Carlo simulation method. For dual optimization, coupling constraints among scenarios are relaxed and the optimization problem is decomposed into deterministic long-term SCUC subproblems. For each deterministic long-term SCUC, resource constraints represent fuel and emission constraints (in the case of vertically integrated utilities) and energy constraints (in the case of electricity markets). Lagrangian relaxation is used to decompose subproblems with long-term SCUC into tractable short-term MIP-based SCUC subproblems without resource constraints. Accordingly, penalty prices (Lagrangian multipliers) are signals to coordinate the master problem and small-scale subproblems. Computational requirements for solving scenario-based optimization models depend on the number of scenarios in which the objective is to minimize the weighted-average generation cost over the entire scenario tree. In large scale applications, the scenario reduction method is introduced for enhancing a tradeoff between calculation speed and accuracy of long-term SCUC solution.

We describe the methodology by which the measurements were obtained and show that, for circuits containing only look-up table-based logic and flip-flops, the ratio of silicon area required to implement them in FPGAs and ASICs is on average 35. Modern FPGAs also contain ""hard"" blocks such as multiplier/accumulators and block memories. We find that these blocks reduce this average area gap significantly to as little as 18 for our benchmarks, and we estimate that extensive use of these hard blocks could potentially lower the gap to below five. The ratio of critical-path delay, from FPGA to ASIC, is roughly three to four with less influence from block memory and hard multipliers. The dynamic power consumption ratio is approximately 14 times and, with hard blocks, this gap generally becomes smaller","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2006.884574","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4068926","Application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC);area comparison;delay comparison;field programmable gate array (FPGA);power comparison","Field programmable gate arrays;CMOS logic circuits;Integrated circuit measurements;Programmable logic arrays;Application specific integrated circuits;Energy consumption;Density measurement;Power measurement;Velocity measurement;Area measurement","application specific integrated circuits;CMOS logic circuits;delays;field programmable gate arrays;table lookup","CMOS FPGA;CMOS ASIC;field programmable gate array;application-specific integrated circuits;logic density;circuit speed;power consumption;core logic;look-up table-based logic;flip-flops;hard blocks;area gap;critical-path delay;block memory;hard multipliers;delay comparison;power comparison;90 nm","","495","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The notion of l-diversity has been proposed to address this; l-diversity requires that each equivalence class has at least l well-represented values for each sensitive attribute. In this paper we show that l-diversity has a number of limitations. In particular, it is neither necessary nor sufficient to prevent attribute disclosure. We propose a novel privacy notion called t-closeness, which requires that the distribution of a sensitive attribute in any equivalence class is close to the distribution of the attribute in the overall table (i.e., the distance between the two distributions should be no more than a threshold t). We choose to use the earth mover distance measure for our t-closeness requirement.

Constant-frequency, pulsewidth modulated (PWM) switching converters, for instance, have poor light-load efficiencies because of higher switching losses while pulse-frequency modulation (PFM) control in discontinuous-conduction mode (DCM) is more efficient at light loads because the switching frequency and associated switching losses are scaled down with load current. This paper presents the design and integrated circuit prototype results of an 83% power efficient 0.5-V 50-mA CMOS PFM buck (step-down) dc-dc converter with a novel adaptive on-time scheme that generates a 27-mV output ripple voltage from a 1.4- to 4.2-V input supply (battery-compatible range). The output ripple voltage variation and steady-state accuracy of the proposed supply was 5 mV (22-27 mV) and 0.6% whereas its constant on-time counterpart was 45 mV (10-55 mV) and 3.6%, respectively. The proposed control scheme provides an accurate power supply while achieving 2%-10% higher power efficiency than conventional fixed on-time schemes with little circuit complexity added, which is critical during light-loading conditions, where quiescent current plays a pivotal role in determining efficiency and battery-life performance","1558-0806","","10.1109/TCSI.2006.887472","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4089130","Adaptive “on” time;dc–dc converter;integrated power supply;pulse-frequency modulation (PFM) control","Pulsed power supplies;Pulse modulation;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Pulse width modulation converters;Pulse width modulation;Power supplies;Personal digital assistants;Optical modulation;Switching loss","adaptive control;CMOS integrated circuits;DC-DC power convertors;power supply circuits;pulse frequency modulation;switching convertors","CMOS switching power supply;adaptive pulse-frequency modulation control;integrated switching power supplies;multimode control;pulsewidth modulated switching converters;discontinuous-conduction mode;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit prototype;buck converter;step-down converter;dc-dc converter","","140","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, we present an active near infrared (NIR) imaging system that is able to produce face images of good condition regardless of visible lights in the environment. Second, we show that the resulting face images encode intrinsic information of the face, subject only to a monotonic transform in the gray tone; based on this, we use local binary pattern (LBP) features to compensate for the monotonic transform, thus deriving an illumination invariant face representation. Then, we present methods for face recognition using NIR images; statistical learning algorithms are used to extract most discriminative features from a large pool of invariant LBP features and construct a highly accurate face matching engine. Finally, we present a system that is able to achieve accurate and fast face recognition in practice, in which a method is provided to deal with specular reflections of active NIR lights on eyeglasses, a critical issue in active NIR image-based face recognition.

Condition monitoring systems (CMS) could resolve the growing wind power industry's need for better maintenance management and increased reliability. Such systems are commonly used in other industries. CMS could continuously monitor the performance of the wind turbine parts and could help determine specific maintenance timing.

We first consider a two-user cognitive radio network and show how the inherent asymmetry in the network can be exploited to increase the agility. We show that our cooperation scheme increases the agility of the cognitive users by as much as 35%.

These properties include, for instance, interaction between grid and generator as in a remote power dispatch, reaction to transients as well as the full electrical effects of a rotating mass.

By incorporating the advantages of the mean shift (MS) segmentation and the normalized cut (Ncut) partitioning methods, the proposed method requires low computational complexity and is therefore very feasible for real-time image segmentation processing. It preprocesses an image by using the MS algorithm to form segmented regions that preserve the desirable discontinuity characteristics of the image. The segmented regions are then represented by using the graph structures, and the Ncut method is applied to perform globally optimized clustering. Because the number of the segmented regions is much smaller than that of the image pixels, the proposed method allows a low-dimensional image clustering with significant reduction of the complexity compared to conventional graph-partitioning methods that are directly applied to the image pixels. In addition, the image clustering using the segmented regions, instead of the image pixels, also reduces the sensitivity to noise and results in enhanced image segmentation performance. Furthermore, to avoid some inappropriate partitioning when considering every region as only one graph node, we develop an improved segmentation strategy using multiple child nodes for each region. The superiority of the proposed method is examined and demonstrated through a large number of experiments using color natural scene images.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2007.902249","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4305291","Color image segmentation;graph partitioning;mean shift (MS);normalized cut (Ncut)","Color;Image segmentation;Pixel;Robustness;Computational complexity;Clustering algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Optimization methods;Noise reduction;Layout","graph theory;image colour analysis;image segmentation;pattern clustering","graph partitioning;image clustering;real-time image segmentation;normalized cut partitioning;color images;robust segmentation;normalized cuts;mean shift segmentation;color image segmentation","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Color;Colorimetry;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","223","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to have high-power density, the converter can be designed to operate in discontinuous conducting mode (DCM) such that the passive inductor can be minimized. The DCM operation associated current ripple can be alleviated by interleaving multiphase currents. However, DCM operation tends to increase turnoff loss because of a high peak current and its associated parasitic ringing due to the oscillation between the inductor and the device output capacitance. Thus, the efficiency is suffered with the conventional DCM operation. Although to reduce the turnoff loss a lossless capacitor snubber can be added across the switch, the energy stored in the capacitor needs to be discharged before device is turned on. This paper adopts a gate signal complimentary control scheme to turn on the nonactive switch and to divert the current into the antiparalleled diode of the active switch so that the main switch can be turned on under zero-voltage condition. This diverted current also eliminates the parasitic ringing in inductor current. For capacitor value selection, there is a tradeoff between turnon and turnoff losses. This paper suggests the optimization of capacitance selection through a series of hardware experiments to ensure the overall power loss minimization under complimentary DCM operating condition. According to the suggested design optimization, a 100-kW hardware prototype is constructed and tested. The experimental results are provided to verify the proposed design approach.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2007.900462","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4267791","Bidirectional dc–dc converter;high-power dc–dc converter;high-power density;synchronous operating mode","Switches;Inductors;Capacitors;DC-DC power converters;Parasitic capacitance;Hardware;Interleaved codes;Snubbers;Diodes;Design optimization","DC-DC power convertors;power capacitors;switching convertors","bidirectional dc-dc power converter;buck boost converters;high-power density;discontinuous conducting mode;current ripple;turnoff loss;parasitic ringing;lossless capacitor snubber;power loss minimization;power 100 kW","","211","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two design methods are provided, which give controller transfer functions with superior frequency response. The complete current controller is realized as the superposition of all individual harmonic controllers. The frequency response of the entire closed loop control is optimal with respect to filtering objectives, i.e., the system provides good overall stability and excellent selectivity for interesting harmonics.

"Accelerated Discrete Degradation Models for Leakage Current of Ultra-Thin Gate Oxides","M. Hsieh; S. Jeng","Tunghai Univ., Taichung; NA","IEEE Transactions on Reliability","","2007","56","3","369","380","Using degradation measurements is becoming more important in reliability studies because fewer failures are observed during short experiment times. Most of the literature discusses continuous degradation processes such as Wiener, gamma, linear, and nonlinear random effect processes. However, some types of degradation processes do not occur in a continuous pattern. Discrete degradations have been found in many practical problems, such as leakage current of thin gate oxides in nano-technology, crack growth of metal fatigue, and fatigue damage of laminates used for industrial specimens. In this research, we establish a procedure based on a likelihood approach to assess the reliability using a discrete degradation model. A non-homogeneous Weibull compound Poisson model with accelerated stress variables is considered. We provide a general maximum likelihood approach for the estimates of model parameters, and derive the breakdown time distributions. A data set measuring the leakage current of nanometer scale gate oxides is analyzed by using the procedure. Goodness-of-fit tests are considered to check the proposed models for the amount of degradation increment, and the rate of event occurrence. The estimated reliabilities are calculated at lower stress of the accelerated variable, and the approximate confidence intervals of quantiles for breakdown time distribution are given to quantify the uncertainty of the estimates. Finally, a simulation study based on the gate oxide data is built for the discrete degradation model to explore the finite sample properties of the proposed procedure.","1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2007.903276","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4298238","Breakdown time;discrete degradation;gate oxides;goodness-of-fit;nanometer;nonhomogeneous compound poisson;reliability;Weibull distribution","Acceleration;Degradation;Leakage current;Fatigue;Stress;Electric breakdown;Laminates;Metals industry;Maximum likelihood estimation;Parameter estimation","fatigue;laminates;leakage currents;maximum likelihood estimation;nanotechnology;Poisson distribution;reliability;Weibull distribution","Weibull distribution;goodness-of-flt tests;maximum likelihood;stress variables;Weibull compound Poisson model;crack growth;laminates;fatigue damage;metal fatigue;nanotechnology;reliability;ultra-thin gate oxides;leakage current;accelerated discrete degradation models","","11","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Widely known as FACTS (Flexible AC Transmission system) devices, these power electronics controllers can regulate voltage and improve stability, hence increasing power flow capability, or they can be used to directly control the power flow, or they can be used to separate regional grid from each other to reduce the interactions between these grids. More advanced applications include the incorporation of energy storage to shape the peak power requirement and to smooth the power output of large wind farms. While the benefit of an actively managed power grid is well understood, widespread use of power electronics controllers in electric power grid is still limited.

Obviously, with no knowledge of the transmitted data and many unknown parameters at the receiver, such as the signal power, carrier frequency and phase offsets, timing information and so on, blind identification of the modulation is a difficult task. This becomes even more challenging in real-world scenarios with multipath fading, frequency-selective and time-varying channels. With this in mind, the authors provide a comprehensive survey of different modulation recognition techniques in a systematic way. A unified notation is used to bring in together, under the same umbrella, the vast amount of results and classifiers, developed for different modulations. The two general classes of automatic modulation identification algorithms are discussed in detail, which rely on the likelihood function and features of the received signal, respectively. The contributions of numerous articles are summarised in compact forms. This helps the reader to see the main characteristics of each technique. However, in many cases, the results reported in the literature have been obtained under different conditions. So, we have also simulated some major techniques under the same conditions, which allows a fair comparison among different methodologies. Furthermore, new problems that have appeared as a result of emerging wireless technologies are outlined.

Zeros are a fundamental aspect of systems and control theory; however, the causes and effects of zeros are more subtle than those of poles. In particular, positive zeros can cause initial undershoot (initial error growth), zero crossings, and overshoot in the step response of a system, whereas nonminimum-phase zeros limit bandwidth. Both of these aspects have real-world implications in many applications. Nonminimum-phase zeros exacerbate the tradeoff between the robustness and achievable performance of a feedback control system. From a control-theoretic point of view, a nonminimum-phase zero in the loop transfer function L is arguably the worst feature a system can possess. Every feedback synthesis methodology must accept limitations due to the presence of open-right-half-plane zeros, and the mark of a good analysis tool is the ability to capture the performance limitations arising from nonminimum-phase zeros.","1941-000X","","10.1109/MCS.2007.365003","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4213166","","Control systems;Poles and zeros;Control theory;Bandwidth;Robust control;Feedback control;Open loop systems;Transfer functions;Control system synthesis;Performance analysis","feedback;poles and zeros","nonminimum-phase system zeros;control-system performance;feedback control system;loop transfer function;servo system","","106","","76","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Due to the enormous progress recently achieved in the technology of light emitting diodes (LEDs) it can be expected that LEDs lighting will replace incandescent and halogen bulbs in general illumination in the near future. A LED light source typically consists of a series connection of single LED cells. It shows a similar behaviour like a zener diode. For efficiency reasons LED strings can not be supplied via series resistors but need switched mode power drivers with current control. Different standard DC-DC converter topologies are discussed which can be adapted to feed a constant current into a LED load. For future LED driver developments it has to be considered that LEDs can also efficiently be supplied by pulsating currents. This simplifies the converter and control design and reduces the number of components. Hence, different converter topologies are studied which are able to stabilise the average value of a pulsating output current. This also includes topologies with galvanic isolation. Resonant operating LED drivers seem to be specially suited for this task. Hence, a series resonant galvanic isolating LED driver is studied in detail. Under certain conditions this converter does not need a current sensor to stabilise the average current in the LED load.

The basic idea for FMCW-Radars is to generate a linear frequency ramp as transmit signal. The difference frequency between the transmitted and received signal is determined after downconversion. In order to detect range and velocity together, the information, extracted from one frequency ramp, is not enough, because it is ambiguous. Several subsequent ramps have to be generated to remove the ambiguity between the frequency portion produced by range and the doppler frequency. In this paper two methods are presented to perform this basic signal processing step. The two methods have the Fast Fourier Transform as basic calculation step in common, but the number of FFTs and their length are different. The requirements on bandwidth for the IF-Hardware and A/D-Converters are also determined by the algorithm for Range-Doppler-Detection.

The inclusions here considered are the multiple split-ring resonators (MSRRs), that represent a straightforward extension of the commonly used split-ring resonators (SRRs), and the spiral resonators (SRs), that enable a greater miniaturization rate. Some physical insights on the resonance mechanism and on the inherent saturation of the resonant frequency when increasing the number of the rings of the MSRRs and the number of the turns of the SRs are given in the paper. New and accurate analytical design formulas, based on a quasi-static model, for both MSRRs and SRs are derived and tested through a proper comparison with the existing formulas and full-wave numerical results. Both MSRRs and SRs are shown to be useful to reduce the electrical dimensions of the resonant inclusions when synthesizing artificial metamaterials.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2007.901950","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4285968","Metamaterials;$\mu$ -negative (MNG) metamaterials;resonant magnetic inclusions;split ring resonators","Spirals;Metamaterials;Magnetic materials;Permeability;Magnetic resonance;Geometry;Electromagnetic fields;Saturation magnetization;Resonant frequency;Dielectric materials","metamaterials;resonators","spiral resonator;multiple split-ring resonator;miniaturized metamaterial sample;miniaturized resonant inclusion;mu-negative material;artificial magnetodielectrics;artificial metamaterial;resonant magnetic inclusion","","212","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Inst., Staines; NA","Proceedings of the IEEE","","2007","95","7","1430","1469","This overview portrays the evolution of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) research. The amelioration of powerful multicarrier OFDM arrangements with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems has numerous benefits, which are detailed in this treatise. We continue by highlighting the limitations of conventional detection and channel estimation techniques designed for multiuser MIMO OFDM systems in the so-called rank-deficient scenarios, where the number of users supported or the number of transmit antennas employed exceeds the number of receiver antennas. This is often encountered in practice, unless we limit the number of users granted access in the base station's or radio port's coverage area. Following a historical perspective on the associated design problems and their state-of-the-art solutions, the second half of this treatise details a range of classic multiuser detectors (MUDs) designed for MIMO-OFDM systems and characterizes their achievable performance. A further section aims for identifying novel cutting-edge genetic algorithm (GA)-aided detector solutions, which have found numerous applications in wireless communications in recent years. In an effort to stimulate the cross pollination of ideas across the machine learning, optimization, signal processing, and wireless communications research communities, we will review the broadly applicable principles of various GA-assisted optimization techniques, which were recently proposed also for employment in multiuser MIMO OFDM. In order to stimulate new research, we demonstrate that the family of GA-aided MUDs is capable of achieving a near-optimum performance at the cost of a significantly lower computational complexity than that imposed by their optimum maximum-likelihood (ML) MUD aided counterparts. The paper is concluded by outlining a range of future research options that may find their way into next-generation wireless systems.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2007.898869","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4287201","Channel estimation;genetic algorithm (GA);multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO);multiuser detection/detector (MUD);orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM);space division multiple access (SDMA)","OFDM;MIMO;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Detectors;Wireless communication;Channel estimation;Receivers;Genetic algorithms;Machine learning","channel estimation;genetic algorithms;MIMO communication;multiuser detection;OFDM modulation","MIMO;OFDM;wireless communication;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;multiple-input multiple-output system;channel estimation technique;multiuser detector;genetic algorithm","","220","","346","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Univ., Kowloon; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","","2007","29","10","1700","1715","Traditional image representations are not suited to conventional classification methods such as the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) because of the undersample problem (USP): the dimensionality of the feature space is much higher than the number of training samples. Motivated by the successes of the two-dimensional LDA (2DLDA) for face recognition, we develop a general tensor discriminant analysis (GTDA) as a preprocessing step for LDA. The benefits of GTDA, compared with existing preprocessing methods such as the principal components analysis (PCA) and 2DLDA, include the following: 1) the USP is reduced in subsequent classification by, for example, LDA, 2) the discriminative information in the training tensors is preserved, and 3) GTDA provides stable recognition rates because the alternating projection optimization algorithm to obtain a solution of GTDA converges, whereas that of 2DLDA does not. We use human gait recognition to validate the proposed GTDA. The averaged gait images are utilized for gait representation. Given the popularity of Gabor-function-based image decompositions for image understanding and object recognition, we develop three different Gabor-function-based image representations: 1) GaborD is the sum of Gabor filter responses over directions, 2) GaborS is the sum of Gabor filter responses over scales, and 3) GaborSD is the sum of Gabor filter responses over scales and directions. The GaborD, GaborS, and GaborSD representations are applied to the problem of recognizing people from their averaged gait images. A large number of experiments were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness (recognition rate) of gait recognition based on first obtaining a Gabor, GaborD, GaborS, or GaborSD image representation, then using GDTA to extract features and, finally, using LDA for classification. The proposed methods achieved good performance for gait recognition based on image sequences from the University of South Florida (USF) HumanID Database.

We propose two new half-duplex relaying protocols that avoid the pre-log factor one-half. Firstly, we consider a relaying protocol where a bidirectional connection between two terminals is established via one amplify-and-forward (AF) or decode-and-forward (DF) relay (two-way relaying). We also extend this protocol to a multi-user scenario, where multiple terminals communicate with multiple partner terminals via several orthogonalize-and-forward (OF) relay terminals, i.e., the relays orthogonalize the different two-way transmissions by a distributed zero-forcing algorithm. Secondly, we propose a relaying protocol where two relays, either AF or DF, alternately forward messages from a source terminal to a destination terminal (two-path relaying).

Reflecting the goals of the Special Issue itself, this paper surveys relevant work from the areas of systems and control, signal processing, detection and estimation, data fusion, and distributed systems. We discuss appropriate network architectures, topics such as coding for robustly stable control in the presence of time-varying channel capacity, channels with fixed versus adaptively variable data width, issues in data rate problems in nonlinear feedback problems, and problems in routing for stability and performance. In surveying current research on networked control systems, we find that recent theoretical advances and target applications are intimately intertwined.

We present a new theory of similarity between words and phrases based on information distance and Kolmogorov complexity. To fix thoughts, we use the World Wide Web (WWW) as the database, and Google as the search engine. The method is also applicable to other search engines and databases. This theory is then applied to construct a method to automatically extract similarity, the Google similarity distance, of words and phrases from the WWW using Google page counts. The WWW is the largest database on earth, and the context information entered by millions of independent users averages out to provide automatic semantics of useful quality. We give applications in hierarchical clustering, classification, and language translation. We give examples to distinguish between colors and numbers, cluster names of paintings by 17th century Dutch masters and names of books by English novelists, the ability to understand emergencies and primes, and we demonstrate the ability to do a simple automatic English-Spanish translation. Finally, we use the WordNet database as an objective baseline against which to judge the performance of our method.

In contrast to the conventional sum-power constraint on the transmit antennas, this paper adopts a more realistic per-antenna power constraint, because in practical implementations each antenna is equipped with its own power amplifier and is limited individually by the linearity of the amplifier. Assuming perfect channel knowledge at the transmitter, this paper investigates two different transmission schemes under the per-antenna power constraint: a minimum-power beamforming design for downlink channels with a single antenna at each remote user and a capacity-achieving transmitter design for downlink channels with multiple antennas at each remote user. It is shown that in both cases, the per-antenna downlink transmitter optimization problem may be transformed into a dual uplink problem with an uncertain noise. This generalizes previous uplink-downlink duality results and transforms the per-antenna transmitter optimization problem into an equivalent minimax optimization problem. Further, it is shown that various notions of uplink-downlink duality may be unified under a Lagrangian duality framework.

The technology and propagation constraints serve as boundary conditions for the determination of the required antenna gain to support ultra-broadband communication. Resulting high-gain antenna requirements will necessitate highly directed transmissions. We propose the use of omni-directional dielectric mirrors to support directed NLOS paths. Their performance is investigated with ray-tracing simulations of a terahertz propagation channel in a dynamic office environment, which is calibrated with measured building-material and mirror parameters.

In contrast to other facial variations, aging variation presents several unique characteristics which make age estimation a challenging task. This paper proposes an automatic age estimation method named AGES (AGing pattErn Subspace). The basic idea is to model the aging pattern, which is defined as the sequence of a particular individual's face images sorted in time order, by constructing a representative subspace. The proper aging pattern for a previously unseen face image is determined by the projection in the subspace that can reconstruct the face image with minimum reconstruction error, while the position of the face image in that aging pattern will then indicate its age. In the experiments, AGES and its variants are compared with the limited existing age estimation methods (WAS and AAS) and some well-established classification methods (kNN, BP, C4.5, and SVM). Moreover, a comparison with human perception ability on age is conducted. It is interesting to note that the performance of AGES is not only significantly better than that of all the other algorithms, but also comparable to that of the human observers.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.70733","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359348","Computer vision;pattern recognition;machine learning;face and gesture recognition;age estimation;Computer vision;pattern recognition;machine learning;face and gesture recognition;age estimation","Aging;Face recognition;Pattern recognition;Humans;Image databases;Image reconstruction;Face detection;Data mining;Senior members;Support vector machines","face recognition;gesture recognition;image reconstruction","human perception ability;face image reconstruction;error reconstruction;aging pattern subspace;facial aging pattern;automatic age estimation","Aging;Algorithms;Anthropometry;Artificial Intelligence;Biometry;Computer Simulation;Face;Face;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Models, Anatomic;Models, Biological;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","528","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We demonstrate that CS has the potential to make two significant improvements to radar systems: (i) eliminating the need for the pulse compression matched filter at the receiver, and (ii) reducing the required receiver analog-to-digital conversion bandwidth so that it need operate only at the radar reflectivity's potentially low ""information rate"" rather than at its potentially high Nyquist rate.

This paper presents an exploratory study of the relationships between specific environmentally sustainable manufacturing practices, and specific competitive outcomes in an environmentally important but under-researched industry, the U.S. commercial carpet industry. In general, empirical research on the impact of environmental practices on organizational outcomes is inconclusive, partly due to limitations of earlier studies. This paper addresses some of these limitations, and surveys the entire U.S. commercial carpet industry; respondents represent 84 of the market. Findings suggest that environmentally sustainable manufacturing practices may be positively associated with competitive outcomes. In particular, different types of environmentally sustainable manufacturing practices (e.g., pollution prevention, product stewardship) are associated with different competitive outcomes (e.g., manufacturing cost, product quality).

Therefore, it is essential that both the traction motor and the associated drive operate at their optimal efficiencies throughout the driving schedule. In typical HEV propulsion applications, the traction motor and the drive are used over the entire torque/speed operational range. In view of this fact, this paper aims at modeling the inverter and motor losses/efficiencies over typical city and highway driving schedules. The noteworthy losses within a typical three-phase dc/ac traction inverter, such as the switching and conduction losses for both the insulated-gate bipolar transistors and the antiparallel diodes, are modeled and simulated over the city and highway driving patterns. An induction motor (IM) is used for a medium-sized sport utility vehicle, which was modeled in the advanced vehicle simulator (ADVISOR) software. The significant IM losses that were considered in the study include the stator copper losses, rotor copper losses, and core losses. Thus, the average efficiencies of both the inverter drive and the induction traction motor are evaluated and summarized under city as well as highway driving conditions.

The hand is conceived to be applied to prosthetics as well as to humanoid and personal robotics; hence, anthropomorphism is a fundamental requirement to be addressed both in the physical aspect and in the functional behavior. In this paper, a biomechatronic approach is addressed to harmonize the mechanical design of the anthropomorphic artificial hand with the design of the hand control system. More in detail, this paper focuses on the control system of the hand and on the optimization of the hand design in order to obtain a human-like kinematics and dynamics. By evaluating the simulated hand performance, the mechanical design is iteratively refined. The mechanical structure and the ratio between number of actuators and number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) have been optimized in order to cope with the strict size and weight constraints that are typical of application of artificial hands to prosthetics and humanoid robotics. The proposed hand has a kinematic structure similar to the natural hand featuring three articulated fingers (thumb, index, and middle finger with 3 DOF for each finger and 1 DOF for the abduction/adduction of the thumb) driven by four dc motors. A special underactuated transmission has been designed that allows keeping the number of motors as low as possible while achieving a self-adaptive grasp, as a result of the passive compliance of the distal DOF of the fingers. A proper hand control scheme has been designed and implemented for the study and optimization of hand motor performance in order to achieve a human-like motor behavior. To this aim, available data on motion of the human fingers are collected from the neuroscience literature in order to derive a reference input for the control. Simulation trials and computer-aided design (CAD) mechanical tools are used to obtain a finger model including its dynamics. Also the closed-loop control system is simulated in order to study the effect of iterative mechanical redesign and to define the final set of mechanical parameters for the hand optimization. Results of the experimental tests carried out for validating the model of the robotic finger, and details on the process of integrated refinement and optimization of the mechanical structure and of the hand motor control scheme are extensively reported in the paper.","1941-014X","","10.1109/TMECH.2007.901936","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4291586","Biomechatronic design;biorobotics;hand motor control;prosthetics","Biomechatronics;Anthropomorphism;Prosthetics;Fingers;DC motors;Humans;Humanoid robots;Control systems;Design optimization;Kinematics","biomechanics;closed loop systems;humanoid robots;prosthetics;robot dynamics;robot kinematics","biomechatronic design;anthropomorphic artificial hand;prosthetics;hand control system;humanoid robotics;kinematic structure;computer-aided design;CAD mechanical tool;closed-loop control system","","224","","46","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose using the inner-distance to build shape descriptors that are robust to articulation and capture part structure. The inner-distance is defined as the length of the shortest path between landmark points within the shape silhouette. We show that it is articulation insensitive and more effective at capturing part structures than the Euclidean distance. This suggests that the inner-distance can be used as a replacement for the Euclidean distance to build more accurate descriptors for complex shapes, especially for those with articulated parts. In addition, texture information along the shortest path can be used to further improve shape classification. With this idea, we propose three approaches to using the inner-distance. The first method combines the inner-distance and multidimensional scaling (MDS) to build articulation invariant signatures for articulated shapes. The second method uses the inner-distance to build a new shape descriptor based on shape contexts. The third one extends the second one by considering the texture information along shortest paths. The proposed approaches have been tested on a variety of shape databases, including an articulated shape data set, MPEG7 CE-Shape-1, Kimia silhouettes, the ETH-80 data set, two leaf data sets, and a human motion silhouette data set.

The correlation is caused by the mutual interaction of the scattering environment and antenna elements. To study the effect of antenna directivity and orientations on the correlation and channel capacity in a more realistic environment, we extend the ldquoone-ringrdquo model to a spherical scattering environment, which is appropriate for narrowband 3D Rayleigh fading. In our model, scatterers around a subscriber unit are distributed over a sphere centered on the antenna array in the subscriber unit. Antenna directivity is included in a precise way, and the antenna array can be placed in any orientation. Any type of antenna can be studied in the model. Through simulation, we find that directive antenna elements in linear broadside arrays make the channel capacity more strongly directive than when antenna elements are isotropic. Moreover, different antenna patterns and orientations have different outage capacities depending on the interaction of antenna directivities and the incident waves, which shows that the antenna pattern and orientation affect the channel capacity to some extent. In the uniformly scatter-rich environment, the microstrip antenna array can have 10% higher outage capacity than that of the dipole antenna array.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2007.895500","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4273721","Antenna radiation pattern;capacity;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","Physics;Fading;Directive antennas;Microstrip antenna arrays;Channel capacity;Rayleigh scattering;Dipole antennas;Microstrip antennas;Antenna arrays;Linear antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns;channel capacity;correlation methods;dipole antenna arrays;microstrip antenna arrays;MIMO communication;Rayleigh channels","dipole antenna array;microstrip antenna array;uniformly scatter-rich environment;incident waves;outage capacities;antenna radiation patterns;linear broadside arrays;directive antenna elements;subscriber unit;narrowband 3D Rayleigh fading;spherical scattering environment;one-ring model;spherical simulation model;multiple-input-multiple-output communication systems;channel capacity;antenna orientation;antenna directivity;multielement antenna systems;fading correlation;antenna physics","","7","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, micromechanical RF filters and reference oscillators based on recently demonstrated vibrating on-chip micromechanical resonators with Q's > 10,000 at 1.5 GHz are described as an attractive solution to the increasing count of RF components (e.g., filters) expected to be needed by future multiband, multimode wireless devices. With Q's this high in on-chip abundance, such devices might also enable a paradigm shift in the design of timing and frequency control functions, where the advantages of high-Q are emphasized, rather than suppressed (e.g., due to size and cost reasons), resulting in enhanced robustness and power savings. Indeed, as vibrating RF MEMS devices are perceived more as circuit building blocks than as stand-alone devices, and as the frequency processing circuits they enable become larger and more complex, the makings of an integrated micromechanical circuit technology begin to take shape, perhaps with a functional breadth not unlike that of integrated transistor circuits. With even more aggressive three-dimensional MEMS technologies, even higher on-chip Q's are possible, such as already achieved via chip-scale atomic physics packages, which so far have achieved Q's > 107 using atomic cells measuring only 10 mm3 in volume and consuming just 5 mW of power, all while still allowing atomic clock Allan deviations down to 10-11 at one hour","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2007.240","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4107685","","Micromechanical devices;Timing;Frequency control;Atomic measurements;Radio frequency;Resonator filters;Integrated circuit technology;Microelectromechanical systems;Oscillators;Cost function","atomic clocks;frequency control;micromechanical resonators;Q-factor;timing;UHF filters","timing control;frequency control;microelectromechanical systems;micromechanical RF filters;reference oscillators;vibrating on-chip micromechanical resonators;multimode wireless devices;vibrating RF MEMS devices;frequency processing circuits;integrated micromechanical circuit technology;integrated transistor circuits;atomic clock Allan deviations;1.5 GHz","Acoustics;Electromagnetics;Electromagnetics;Electromagnetics;Equipment Design;Mechanics;Miniaturization;Radio Waves;Technology;Technology;Transducers","555","","64","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The eta-mu distribution includes the Hoyt (Nakagami-q), the Nakagami-m, the Rayleigh, and the one-sided Gaussian distributions as special cases. Field measurement campaigns were used to validate these distributions. It was observed that their fit to experimental data outperformed that provided by the widely known fading distributions, such as the Rayleigh, Rice, and Nakagami-m.

Due to unique characteristics, such as dynamic network topology, limited bandwidth, and limited battery power, routing in a MANET is a particularly challenging task compared to a conventional network. Early work in MANET research has mainly focused on developing an efficient routing mechanism in such a highly dynamic and resource-constrained network. At present, several efficient routing protocols have been proposed for MANET. Most of these protocols assume a trusted and cooperative environment. However, in the presence of malicious nodes, the networks are vulnerable to various kinds of attacks. In MANET, routing attacks are particularly serious. In this article, we investigate the state-of-the-art of security issues in MANET. In particular, we examine routing attacks, such as link spoofing and colluding misrelay attacks, as well as countermeasures against such attacks in existing MANET protocols.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.2007.4396947","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4396947","","Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Batteries;Bandwidth;Costs;Network topology;Intelligent networks;Wireless sensor networks;Military communication;Vehicles","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security","routing attacks;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;routing protocols;malicious nodes;telecommunication security;MANET protocols","","234","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The major issue arises in island operation with inverter-based sources. Inverter fault currents are limited by the ratings of the silicon devices to around 2 p.u. rated current.

Emergency and standby power, electrical preventive maintenance, and evaluating and improving reliability of the existing plant are also addressed.

The intended audience for this material is primarily consulting engineers and plant electrical engineers and technicians. The design of reliable industrial and commercial power distribution systems is important because of the high cost associated with power outages. It is necessary to consider the cost of power outages when making design decisions for new power distribution systems as well as to have the ability to make quantitative “cost-versus-reliability” trade-off studies. The lack of credible data concerning equipment reliability and the cost of power outages has hindered engineers in making such studies. This edition of the IEEE Std 493 overcomes these obstacles.

Vienna, Vienna","Twenty-Third Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC 2007)","","2007","","","421","430","Malicious code is an increasingly important problem that threatens the security of computer systems. The traditional line of defense against malware is composed of malware detectors such as virus and spyware scanners. Unfortunately, both researchers and malware authors have demonstrated that these scanners, which use pattern matching to identify malware, can be easily evaded by simple code transformations. To address this shortcoming, more powerful malware detectors have been proposed. These tools rely on semantic signatures and employ static analysis techniques such as model checking and theorem proving to perform detection. While it has been shown that these systems are highly effective in identifying current malware, it is less clear how successful they would be against adversaries that take into account the novel detection mechanisms. The goal of this paper is to explore the limits of static analysis for the detection of malicious code. To this end, we present a binary obfuscation scheme that relies on the idea of opaque constants, which are primitives that allow us to load a constant into a register such that an analysis tool cannot determine its value. Based on opaque constants, we build obfuscation transformations that obscure program control flow, disguise access to local and global variables, and interrupt tracking of values held in processor registers. Using our proposed obfuscation approach, we were able to show that advanced semantics-based malware detectors can be evaded. Moreover, our opaque constant primitive can be applied in a way such that is provably hard to analyze for any static code analyzer. This demonstrates that static analysis techniques alone might no longer be sufficient to identify malware.","1063-9527","978-0-7695-3060-4","10.1109/ACSAC.2007.21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4413008","","Detectors;Registers;Computer security;Face detection;Application software;Pattern matching;Performance analysis;Power system modeling;Internet;Databases","invasive software;program diagnostics;program verification;theorem proving","static analysis;malware detection;malicious code;computer systems security;virus detection;spyware scanner;pattern matching;code transformation;semantic signatures;model checking;theorem proving;obfuscation transformation;program control flow","","278","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The first uses the basic line detector whose response is thresholded to obtain unsupervised pixel classification.

A major impairment in FSO links is the turbulence- induced fading which severely degrades the link performance. To mitigate turbulence-induced fading and, therefore, to improve the error rate performance, spatial diversity can be used over FSO links which involves the deployment of multiple laser transmitters/receivers. In this paper, we investigate the bit error rate (BER) performance of FSO links with spatial diversity over log- normal atmospheric turbulence fading channels, assuming both independent and correlated channels among transmitter/receiver apertures. Our analytical derivations build upon an approximation to the sum of correlated log-normal random variables. The derived BER expressions quantify the effect of spatial diversity and possible spatial correlations in a log-normal channel.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2007.06109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4290022","","Bit error rate;Optical transmitters;Fading;Optical receivers;Bandwidth;Commercialization;Degradation;Error analysis;Apertures;Random variables","atmospheric turbulence;error statistics;fading channels;MIMO communication;optical communication","BER performance;free-space optical transmission;spatial diversity;turbulence-induced fading;bit error rate;multiple laser transmitters/receivers;log-normal channel;MIMO","","455","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We show that the use of tensor notations for the messages is very convenient for the algorithm description and understanding. In the second part of the letter, we introduce a simplified decoder which is inspired by the min-sum decoder for binary LDPC codes. We called this decoder extended min-sum (EMS). We show that it is possible to greatly reduce the computational complexity of the check-node processing by computing approximate reliability measures with a limited number of values in a message. By choosing appropriate correction factors or offsets, we show that the EMS decoder performance is quite good, and in some cases better than the regular BP decoder. The optimal values of the factor and offset correction are obtained asymptotically with simulated density evolution.

The uniqueness of the antenna designs are that they allow various groups of their operating frequency bands to be selected electronically. In particular, each group of frequency bands, or mode, can be made to serve several different communication systems simultaneously. These systems may include various combinations of GSM, DCS, PCS, UMTS, Bluetooth, and wireless local-area network (LAN). Therefore, by electronically selecting different antenna modes, a variety of communication systems can be conveniently served by only one antenna. One advantage is that through the different operational modes, the total antenna volume can be reused, and therefore the overall antenna can be made compact. In these designs, the selection of the different modes is achieved by either i) switching different feeding locations of the antenna (switched feed) or ii) switching or breaking of the antenna's connection to the ground (switched ground). This paper demonstrates these two designs. For the first design of switched feed, it can support GSM, DCS, PCS, and UMTS. In the second design, the antenna makes use of a switched-ground technique, which can cover GSM, DCS, PCS, UMTS, Bluetooth, and 2.4 GHz wireless LAN. The designs are investigated when ideal switches and also various realistic active switches based on PIN diodes, GaAs field effect transistor, and MEMs configurations. The designs are verified through both numerical simulations and measurement of an experimental prototype. The results confirm good performance of the two multiband reconfigurable antenna designs.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2007.895634","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4267912","Planar inverted F-antenna (PIFA);reconfigurable antennas;volume reuse;wireless communications","Wireless communication;GSM;Distributed control;Personal communication networks;3G mobile communication;Frequency;Bluetooth;Wireless LAN;Local area networks;Antenna feeds","3G mobile communication;antenna feeds;Bluetooth;cellular radio;multifrequency antennas;UHF antennas;wireless LAN","compact reconfigurable multiband antennas;wireless communication devices;mobile communication devices;antenna feeding locations;switched feed;GSM;DCS;PCS;UMTS;Bluetooth;wireless LAN;frequency 2.4 GHz","","133","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, evaluation of segmentation algorithms thus far has been largely subjective, leaving a system designer to judge the effectiveness of a technique based only on intuition and results in the form of a few example segmented images. This is largely due to image segmentation being an ill-defined problem-there is no unique ground-truth segmentation of an image against which the output of an algorithm may be compared. This paper demonstrates how a recently proposed measure of similarity, the normalized probabilistic rand (NPR) index, can be used to perform a quantitative comparison between image segmentation algorithms using a hand-labeled set of ground-truth segmentations. We show that the measure allows principled comparisons between segmentations created by different algorithms, as well as segmentations on different images. We outline a procedure for algorithm evaluation through an example evaluation of some familiar algorithms - the mean-shift-based algorithm, an efficient graph-based segmentation algorithm, a hybrid algorithm that combines the strengths of both methods, and expectation maximization.

In this work we summarize most of the concepts related to localization systems for WSNs as well as how to localize the nodes in these networks (which allows the localization of phenomena).

Such sensor modules contain three orthogonally mounted angular rate sensors, three orthogonal linear accelerometers and three orthogonal magnetometers. This paper describes a method for using accelerometer data combined with orientation estimates from the same modules to calculate position during walking and running. The periodic nature of these motions includes short periods of zero foot velocity when the foot is in contact with the ground. This pattern allows for precise drift error correction.

However, the conventional broadcast mechanism may lead to the so-called broadcast storm problem, a scenario in which there is a high level of contention and collisions at the link layer due to an excessive number of broadcast packets. While this is a well-known problem in mobile ad hoc wireless networks, only a few studies have addressed this issue in the VANET context, where mobile hosts move along the roads in a certain limited set of directions as opposed to randomly moving in arbitrary directions within a bounded area. Unlike other existing works, we quantify the impact of broadcast storms in VANETs in terms of message delay and packet loss rate in addition to conventional metrics such as message reachability and overhead. Given that VANET applications are currently confined to using the DSRC protocol at the data link layer, we propose three probabilistic and timer-based broadcast suppression techniques: weighted p-persistence, slotted 1-persistence, and slotted p-persistence schemes, to be used at the network layer. Our simulation results show that the proposed schemes can significantly reduce contention at the MAC layer by achieving up to 70 percent reduction in packet loss rate while keeping end-to-end delay at acceptable levels for most VANET applications.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.2007.4407231","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4407231","","Broadcasting;Storms;Ad hoc networks;Delay;Spread spectrum communication;Telecommunication traffic;Vehicles;Road accidents;Wireless networks;Protocols","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;traffic information systems;vehicles","broadcast storm mitigation;vehicular ad hoc networks;multihop applications;traffic information;VANET context;arbitrary directions;message delay;packet loss rate;DSRC protocol","","497","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Annotation and retrieval are posed as classification problems where each class is defined as the group of database images labeled with a common semantic label. It is shown that, by establishing this one-to-one correspondence between semantic labels and semantic classes, a minimum probability of error annotation and retrieval are feasible with algorithms that are 1) conceptually simple, 2) computationally efficient, and 3) do not require prior semantic segmentation of training images. In particular, images are represented as bags of localized feature vectors, a mixture density estimated for each image, and the mixtures associated with all images annotated with a common semantic label pooled into a density estimate for the corresponding semantic class. This pooling is justified by a multiple instance learning argument and performed efficiently with a hierarchical extension of expectation-maximization. The benefits of the supervised formulation over the more complex, and currently popular, joint modeling of semantic label and visual feature distributions are illustrated through theoretical arguments and extensive experiments. The supervised formulation is shown to achieve higher accuracy than various previously published methods at a fraction of their computational cost.

A prototype imager using the MRSS ADC architecture was realized in a 0.25 CMOS process. Measurements demonstrate that the conversion speed of an MRSS ADC is 3.3 higher than a single-slope ADC while dissipating only 16% more power. Furthermore, the MRSS ADC can be easily adapted to exhibit a companding characteristic, which exploits the amplitude-dependent nature of the photon shot noise present in imager signals.

Behind this trajectory was the continuous advancement of power semiconductor device technology allowing an increase of converter switching frequencies by a factor of 10 every decade. However, today's cooling concepts, and passive components and wire bond interconnection technologies could be major barriers for a continuation of this trend. For identifying and quantifying such technological barriers this paper investigates the volume of the cooling system and of the main passive components for the basic forms of power electronics energy conversion in dependency of the switching frequency and determines switching frequencies minimizing the total volume. The analysis is for 5 kW rated output power, high performance air cooling, advanced power semiconductors, and single systems in all cases. A power density limit of 28 kW/dm3@300 kHz is calculated for an isolated DC-DC converter considering only transformer, output inductor and heat sink volume. For single-phase AC-DC conversion a general limit of 35 kW/dm3 results from the DC link capacitor required for buffering the power fluctuating with twice the mains frequency. For a three-phase unity power factor PWM rectifier the limit is 45 kW/dm3@810 kHz just taking into account EMI filter and cooling system. For the sparse matrix converter the limiting components are the input EMI filter and the common mode output inductor; the power density limit is 71 kW/dm3@50 kHz when not considering the cooling system. The calculated power density limits highlight the major importance of broadening the scope of research in power electronics from traditional areas like converter topologies, and modulation and control concepts to cooling systems, high frequency electromagnetics, interconnection technology, multi-functional integration, packaging and multi-domain modeling and simulation to ensure further advancement of the field along the power density trajectory.","","1-4244-0843-1","10.1109/PCCON.2007.372914","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4239129","Figures of Merit;Power density;Cooling system;Passive components","Pulse width modulation converters;Electronics cooling;Power electronics;Switching frequency;Power system interconnection;Inductors;Frequency conversion;Pulse width modulation;Electromagnetic interference;Filters","AC-DC power convertors;DC-DC power convertors;power factor;power semiconductor devices;PWM power convertors;rectifiers","PWM converter;power density;converter switching frequencies;cooling system;power electronics energy conversion;power semiconductors;DC-DC converter;single-phase AC-DC conversion;three-phase unity power factor PWM rectifier;sparse matrix converter;power 5 kW;frequency 300 kHz;frequency 810 kHz;frequency 50 kHz","","184","","73","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Design and Implementation of a Robust Current-Control Scheme for a PMSM Vector Drive With a Simple Adaptive Disturbance Observer","Y. A. I. Mohamed","Waterloo Univ., Waterloo","IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","","2007","54","4","1981","1988","This paper introduces a robust current-control scheme for a permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) with a simple adaptive disturbance observer. The robust controller is realized by including an adaptive element in the reference-voltage-generation stage using the feedforward control. Due to the time-varying nature and the high-bandwidth property of the uncertainties in a practical PMSM drive system, the adaptive element is simply chosen as the estimated uncertainty function, which adaptively varies with different operating conditions. Subsequently, the frequency modes of the uncertainty function are embedded in the control effort, and a robust current-control performance is yielded. Furthermore, the inclusion of the estimated uncertainty function provides an efficient solution for torque-ripple minimization in PMSM drives. This is because the frequency modes of the disturbances to be eliminated, i.e., the flux harmonics, are included in the stable closed-loop system. To provide a high-bandwidth estimate of the uncertainty function, a simple adaptation law is derived using the nominal current dynamics and the steepest descent method. To guarantee the system's convergence and to properly tune the proposed observer, a stability analysis based on a discrete-time Lyapunov function has been used. Comparative evaluation experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme under different operating conditions.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2007.895074","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4273665","Adaptive control;current control;disturbance estimation;permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM);torque-ripple minimization","Robustness;Drives;Uncertainty;Robust control;Frequency;Synchronous motors;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Time varying systems;Adaptive systems","closed loop systems;discrete time systems;feedforward;Lyapunov methods;machine vector control;permanent magnet motors;robust control;synchronous motor drives;time-varying systems","discrete-time Lyapunov function;stability analysis;steepest descent method;nominal current dynamics;closed-loop system;torque-ripple minimization;uncertainty function;time-varying control;feedforward control;reference-voltage generation;permanent-magnet synchronous motor;adaptive disturbance observer;PMSM vector drive;robust current-control scheme","","181","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nemoto","Tohoku Univ., Sendai; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","","2007","56","6","3337","3347","There are numerous research challenges that need to be addressed until a wide deployment of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) becomes possible. One of the critical issues consists of the design of scalable routing algorithms that are robust to frequent path disruptions caused by vehicles' mobility. This paper argues the use of information on vehicles' movement information (e.g., position, direction, speed, and digital mapping of roads) to predict a possible link-breakage event prior to its occurrence. Vehicles are grouped according to their velocity vectors. This kind of grouping ensures that vehicles, belonging to the same group, are more likely to establish stable single and multihop paths as they are moving together. Setting up routes that involve only vehicles from the same group guarantees a high level of stable communication in VANETs. The scheme presented in this paper also reduces the overall traffic in highly mobile VANET networks. The frequency of flood requests is reduced by elongating the link duration of the selected paths. To prevent broadcast storms that may be intrigued during path discovery operation, another scheme is also introduced. The basic concept behind the proposed scheme is to broadcast only specific and well-defined packets, referred to as ldquobest packetsrdquo in this paper. The performance of the scheme is evaluated through computer simulations. Simulation results indicate the benefits of the proposed routing strategy in terms of increasing link duration, reducing the number of link-breakage events and increasing the end-to-end throughput.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2007.906873","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4357358","Intervehicular communications (IVC);road–vehicle communications (RVC);stable routing;vehicular ad hoc network (VANET);IVC;RVC;VANET;Stable Routing","Routing protocols;Broadcasting;Ad hoc networks;Algorithm design and analysis;Robustness;Road vehicles;Mobile communication;Telecommunication traffic;Frequency;Floods","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols;vehicles","routing protocol;ITS services;vehicular ad hoc networks;routing algorithms;path disruptions;vehicle mobility;vehicle movement information;link-breakage event;velocity vectors;multihop paths;mobile VANET networks;flood requests;broadcast storms;path discovery operation;routing strategy;link duration","","250","","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

But for a STATCOM with traditional control strategies, unbalanced utility voltages will greatly affect the performance of the STATCOM and, in severe cases, may even cause the shutdown of the STATCOM for overcurrent protection. This paper proposes novel control strategies to ensure normal operation of STATCOM in three-phase three-wire systems when severe system voltage unbalance occurs and, furthermore, to mitigate voltage unbalance at the point of common coupling (PCC) whether it is caused by the utility or load. The control laws, operation principles, compensation characteristics, and operating point optimization of the proposed control strategies are analyzed and compared in detail. The power flow in the STATCOM and corresponding dc-side voltage-control schemes for these control strategies are also introduced. It is shown that the proposed voltage-controlled current source (VCCS) strategy and modified voltage-controlled voltage source strategy are valid for voltage unbalance compensation, especially the VCCS strategy for low rating under the same performance. Finally, the simulation and experimental investigations were carried out with these three parameter-optimized control strategies, respectively, for light and heavy load conditions. The results verified that the current passing through the STATCOM is under control and the voltage at the PCC is more balanced than before compensation. The compensation performance of the STATCOM is thus proven satisfactory","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2006.876655","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4039441","Control strategy;point of common coupling (PCC);static compensator (STATCOM);voltage-controlled current source (VCCS);voltage-controlled voltage source (VCVS);voltage unbalance","Automatic voltage control;Voltage control;Control systems;Power system dynamics;STATCOM;Load flow;Power system harmonics;Power quality;Power control;Power system protection","load flow;optimal control;overcurrent protection;reactive power control;static VAr compensators;voltage control","operating point optimization;STATCOM control;voltage unbalance mitigation;three-phase three-wire systems;reactive power control;static compensator;unbalanced utility voltages;overcurrent protection;point of common coupling;power flow;voltage controlled current source strategy;parameter optimized control strategy","","80","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we discuss an equivalence between the objective functions used in these seemingly different methods - in particular, a general weighted kernel k-means objective is mathematically equivalent to a weighted graph clustering objective. We exploit this equivalence to develop a fast high-quality multilevel algorithm that directly optimizes various weighted graph clustering objectives, such as the popular ratio cut, normalized cut, and ratio association criteria. This eliminates the need for any eigenvector computation for graph clustering problems, which can be prohibitive for very large graphs. Previous multilevel graph partitioning methods such as Metis have suffered from the restriction of equal-sized clusters; our multilevel algorithm removes this restriction by using kernel k-means to optimize weighted graph cuts. Experimental results show that our multilevel algorithm outperforms a state-of-the-art spectral clustering algorithm in terms of speed, memory usage, and quality. We demonstrate that our algorithm is applicable to large-scale clustering tasks such as image segmentation, social network analysis, and gene network analysis.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1115","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4302760","Clustering;Data Mining;Segmentation;Kernel;k-means;k-means;Spectral Clustering;Graph Partitioning","Clustering algorithms;Kernel;Partitioning algorithms;Image segmentation;Algorithm design and analysis;Optimization methods;Image analysis;Social network services;Large-scale systems;Data mining","graph theory;pattern clustering","kernel k-means algorithm;weighted graph clustering objective;multilevel graph partitioning method;spectral clustering algorithm","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","383","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The required notch filtering in the feed-forward path is realized through a receiver translational loop, driven by the same local oscillator (LO) signals used in the main receiver. For the proof of concept, a prototype amplifier in 65 nm standard CMOS, intended for Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) applications, is implemented.

Aiming to provide an integrated solution of the resonant converter, a half-bridge (HB) power metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) module employing silicon-on-insulator technology has been designed. Such a technology, which is suitable for high-voltage and high-frequency applications, allows enabling HB power MOSFET modules operating up to 3MHz with a rated voltage of 400V. The power device integrates the driving stages of the high-side and low-side switch along with a latch circuit used to implement over-voltage/over-current protection. The module has been designed to be driven by a digital signal processor device, which has been adopted to perform frequency modulation of the resonant converter. By this way, output voltage regulation against variations from light- to full-loaded conditions has been achieved. The issues related to the transformer design of the LLC resonant converter are discussed, too. Owing to the high switching frequency experienced by the converter, 3F4 ferrite cores have been selected for their low magnetic power losses between 0.5 and 3 MHz and core temperatures up to 120degC.

Detection and classification of very low SNR signals with relaxed information on the signal parameters being detected is critical for proper CR functionality as it enables the CR to react and adapt to the changes in its radio environment. In this work, the cycle frequency domain profile (CDP) is used for signal detection and preprocessing for signal classification. Signal features are extracted from CDP using a threshold-test method. For classification, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) has been used to process extracted signal features due to its robust pattern-matching capability. We also investigate the effects of varied observation length on signal detection and classification. It is found that the CDP-based detector and the HMM-based classifier can detect and classify incoming signals at a range of low SNRs.","","1-4244-0663-3","10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.35","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221497","","Signal detection;Cognitive radio;Chromium;Hidden Markov models;Adaptive signal detection;Feature extraction;Frequency domain analysis;Pattern classification;Signal processing;Robustness","cognitive radio;feature extraction;frequency-domain analysis;hidden Markov models;pattern matching;radio spectrum management;signal classification;signal detection","cyclostationary approach;signal detection;signal classification;cognitive radio;spectrum awareness;cycle frequency domain profile;feature extraction;threshold-test method;hidden Markov model;HMM;pattern matching","","204","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The design of aperiodic (nonuniform and thinned) antenna arrays is presented as an example for the application of the PSO engine. In particular, in order to achieve an improved peak sidelobe level (SLL), element positions in a nonuniform array are optimized by real-number PSO (RPSO). On the other hand, in a thinned array, the on/off state of each element is determined by binary PSO (BPSO). Optimizations for both nonuniform arrays and thinned arrays are also expanded to multiobjective cases. As a result, nondominated designs on the Pareto front enable one to achieve other design factors than the peak SLL. Optimized antenna arrays are compared with periodic arrays and previously presented aperiodic arrays.

Traditional development methodologies are too cumbersome to meet the rapidly changing requirements and short product cycles demanded by business. To meet these changing requirements, software developers have developed agile software development methodologies (SDMs) utilizing iterative development, prototyping, and templates. This research project investigated agile SDM implementation using an online survey sent to practitioners worldwide. This survey data were used to identify factors related to agile SDM implementation. Factors that included training, management involvement, access to external resources, and corporate size were found to impact implementation of an agile software development methodology. Factors such as using models, having an implementation plan, collocating the development team, and developing software for Internet or intranet use did not impact the implementation of an agile software development methodology. Several of the factors that impact the implementation of an agile development methodology are under the control of management.

"Brightness Preserving Dynamic Histogram Equalization for Image Contrast Enhancement","H. Ibrahim; N. S. Pik Kong","Univcrsiti Sains Malaysia, Nibong Tebal; NA","IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","","2007","53","4","1752","1758","Histogram equalization (HE) is one of the common methods used for improving contrast in digital images. However, this technique is not very well suited to be implemented in consumer electronics, such as television, because the method tends to introduce unnecessary visual deterioration such as the saturation effect. One of the solutions to overcome this weakness is by preserving the mean brightness of the input image inside the output image. This paper proposes a new method, known as brightness preserving dynamic histogram equalization (BPDHE), which is an extension to HE that can produce the output image with the mean intensity almost equal to the mean intensity of the input, thus fulfill the requirement of maintaining the mean brightness of the image. First, the method smoothes the input histogram with one dimensional Gaussian filter, and then partitions the smoothed histogram based on its local maximums. Next, each partition will be assigned to a new dynamic range. After that, the histogram equalization process is applied independently to these partitions, based on this new dynamic range. For sure, the changes in dynamic range, and also histogram equalization process will alter the mean brightness of the image.

Yunlin Univ. of Sci. & Technol., Yunlin; NA","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","","2007","22","4","1665","1674","This paper presents a fuzzy-optimization approach for solving the generation scheduling problem with consideration of wind and solar energy systems. Wind and solar energy are being considered in the power system to schedule unit power output to minimize the total thermal unit fuel cost. When performing the generation scheduling problem in conventional methods, the hourly load, available water, wind speed, solar radiation must be forecasted to prevent errors. However, actually there are always errors in these forecasted values. A characteristic feature of the proposed fuzzy-optimization approach is that the forecast hourly load, available water, wind speed and solar radiation errors can be taken into account using fuzzy sets. Fuzzy set notations in the hourly load, available water, wind speed, solar radiation, spinning reserve and total fuel cost are developed to obtain the optimal generation schedule under an uncertain environment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the generation scheduling problem is performed in a simplified generation system. The results show that a proper generating schedule for each unit can be reached using the proposed method.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2007.907527","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4349101","Fuzzy-optimization approach;fuzzy sets;generation scheduling;renewable energy","Wind energy generation;Solar power generation;Wind energy;Solar energy;Wind speed;Solar radiation;Wind forecasting;Fuels;Load forecasting;Fuzzy sets","fuzzy set theory;optimisation;power engineering computing;power generation scheduling;solar power stations;wind power plants","fuzzy-optimization approach;generation scheduling;wind energy systems;solar energy systems;thermal unit fuel cost;fuzzy set notation","","197","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A probability-based estimation of the relevance is suggested by first projecting the motion data onto a generic latent space using principal component analysis. The resulting signals are encoded using a mixture of Gaussian/Bernoulli distributions (Gaussian mixture model/Bernoulli mixture model). This provides a measure of the spatio-temporal correlations across the different modalities collected from the robot, which can be used to determine a metric of the imitation performance.

"Novel Eye Gaze Tracking Techniques Under Natural Head Movement","Z. Zhu; Q. Ji","Rensselaer Polytech. Inst., Troy; Rensselaer Polytech. Inst., Troy","IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","","2007","54","12","2246","2260","Most available remote eye gaze trackers have two characteristics that hinder them being widely used as the important computer input devices for human computer interaction. First, they have to be calibrated for each user individually; second, they have low tolerance for head movement and require the users to hold their heads unnaturally still. In this paper, by exploiting the eye anatomy, we propose two novel solutions to allow natural head movement and minimize the calibration procedure to only one time for a new individual. The first technique is proposed to estimate the 3D eye gaze directly. In this technique, the cornea of the eyeball is modeled as a convex mirror. Via the properties of convex mirror, a simple method is proposed to estimate the 3D optic axis of the eye. The visual axis, which is the true 3D gaze direction of the user, can be determined subsequently after knowing the angle deviation between the visual axis and optic axis by a simple calibration procedure. Therefore, the gaze point on an object in the scene can be obtained by simply intersecting the estimated 3D gaze direction with the object. Different from the first technique, our second technique does not need to estimate the 3D eye gaze directly, and the gaze point on an object is estimated from a gaze mapping function implicitly. In addition, a dynamic computational head compensation model is developed to automatically update the gaze mapping function whenever the head moves. Hence, the eye gaze can be estimated under natural head movement. Furthermore, it minimizes the calibration procedure to only one time for a new individual. The advantage of the proposed techniques over the current state of the art eye gaze trackers is that it can estimate the eye gaze of the user accurately under natural head movement, without need to perform the gaze calibration every time before using it. Our proposed methods will improve the usability of the eye gaze tracking technology, and we believe that it represents an important step for the eye tracker to be accepted as a natural computer input device.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2007.895750","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359993","Eye gaze tracking;gaze estimation;human computer interaction","Tracking;Calibration;Mirrors;Human computer interaction;Anatomy;Cornea;Layout;Computational modeling;State estimation;Usability","biomechanics;eye;vision","eye gaze tracking;natural head movement;human computer interaction;calibration;convex mirror;visual axis;optic axis;dynamic computational head","Computer Simulation;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Eye Movement Measurements;Eye Movements;Fixation, Ocular;Head Movements;Humans;Models, Biological;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","155","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Enhancing the Reliability and Security of the Information Infrastructure Used to Manage the Power System","F. Cleveland","IEEE Member, PES-PSCC","2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","","2007","","","1","8","In the power industry, the focus has been almost exclusively on implementing equipment that can keep the power system reliable. Until recently, communications and information flows have been considered of peripheral importance. However, increasingly the information infrastructure that supports the monitoring and control of the power system has come to be critical to the reliability of the power system. Communication protocols are one of the most critical parts of power system operations, responsible for retrieving information from field equipment and, vice versa, for sending control commands. Despite their key function, to-date these communication protocols have rarely incorporated any security measures, including security against inadvertent errors, power system equipment malfunctions, communications equipment failures, or deliberate sabotage. Since these protocols were very specialized, ""security by obscurity"" has been the primary approach. However, security by obscurity is no longer a valid concept. In particular, the electricity market is pressuring market participants to gain any edge they can. A tiny amount of information can turn a losing bid into a winning bid - or withholding that information from your competitor can make their winning bid into a losing bid. And the desire to disrupt power system operations can stem from careless mistakes, to simple teenager bravado, to competitive game-playing in the electrical marketplace, and even to actual terrorism. As the power industry relies increasingly on information to operate the power system, two infrastructures must now be managed: not only the power system infrastructure, but also the information infrastructure. The management of the power system infrastructure has become reliant on the information infrastructure as automation continues to replace manual operations, as market forces demand more accurate and timely information, and as the power system equipment ages. Therefore, the reliability of the power system is increasingly affected by any problems that the information infrastructure might suffer. This paper focuses on IEC TC57 WG15 security standards work which is addressing the reliability and security of the information infrastructure.","1932-5517","1-4244-1296-X","10.1109/PES.2007.386013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4275779","Security;reliability;information infrastructure;communications;IEC;power system operations;IEC 61850;DNP;ICCP;IEC 60870-5","Power system reliability;Power system security;Power system management;Information security;Energy management;Communication system security;Power system control;Power systems;Power system measurements;Protocols","power markets;power system control;power system economics;power system management;power system reliability;power system security","reliability enhancement;information infrastructure security;power system management;power industry;power system reliability;power system control;power system monitoring;communication protocols;power system equipment malfunctions;electricity market;IEC TC57 WG15 security standards","","23","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, licensees are protected from any interference all the time. From a practical standpoint, however, an unlicensed (secondary) user may share a frequency band with its licensed (primary) owner as long as the interference it incurs is not deemed harmful by the licensee. In a fading environment, a secondary user may take advantage of this fact by opportunistically transmitting with high power when its signal, as received by the licensed receiver, is deeply faded. In this paper we investigate the capacity gains offered by this dynamic spectrum sharing approach when channels vary due to fading. In particular, we quantify the relation between the secondary channel capacity and the interference inflicted on the primary user. We further evaluate and compare the capacity under different fading distributions.

Virtanen","Tampere Univ. of Technol.","IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","","2007","15","3","1066","1074","An unsupervised learning algorithm for the separation of sound sources in one-channel music signals is presented. The algorithm is based on factorizing the magnitude spectrogram of an input signal into a sum of components, each of which has a fixed magnitude spectrum and a time-varying gain. Each sound source, in turn, is modeled as a sum of one or more components. The parameters of the components are estimated by minimizing the reconstruction error between the input spectrogram and the model, while restricting the component spectrograms to be nonnegative and favoring components whose gains are slowly varying and sparse. Temporal continuity is favored by using a cost term which is the sum of squared differences between the gains in adjacent frames, and sparseness is favored by penalizing nonzero gains. The proposed iterative estimation algorithm is initialized with random values, and the gains and the spectra are then alternatively updated using multiplicative update rules until the values converge. Simulation experiments were carried out using generated mixtures of pitched musical instrument samples and drum sounds. The performance of the proposed method was compared with independent subspace analysis and basic nonnegative matrix factorization, which are based on the same linear model. According to these simulations, the proposed method enables a better separation quality than the previous algorithms. Especially, the temporal continuity criterion improved the detection of pitched musical sounds.

The Z-source inverter utilizes an exclusive Z-source (LC) network to link the main inverter circuit to the FC (or any dc power source). By substituting one of the capacitors in the Z-source with a battery and controlling the shoot through duty ratio and modulation index independently, one is able to control the FC power, output power, and SOC of the battery at the same time.

Spectrally efficient, inexpensive cellular systems are by definition densely populated and interference-limited. But spatial multiplexing MIMO systems- whose principal merit is a supposed dramatic increase in spectral efficiency- lose much of their effectiveness in high levels of interference. This article overviews several approaches to handling interference in multicell MIMO systems. The discussion is applicable to any multi-antenna cellular network, including 802.16e/WiMAX, 3GPP (HSDPA and 3GPP LTE), and 3GPP2 (lxEVDO). We argue that many of the traditional interference management techniques have limited usefulness (or are even counterproductive) when viewed in concert with MIMO. The problem of interference in MIMO systems is too large in scope to be handled with a single technique: in practice a combination of complementary countermeasures will be needed. We overview emerging system-level interference-reducing strategies based on cooperation, which will be important for overcoming interference in future spatial multiplexing cellular systems.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.2007.4407232","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4407232","","Interference;MIMO;Land mobile radio cellular systems;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Multiaccess communication;Wireless LAN;WiMAX;Downlink;Transmitters","broadband networks;interference (signal);interference suppression;MIMO communication;multiplexing;telecommunication network management","spatial multiplexing;MIMO cellular networks;interference;multiantenna transmission and reception;wireless broadband services;spectral efficiency","","266","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The cognitive behavior helps the particle to remember its previously visited best position. This paper proposes a split-up in the cognitive behavior. That is, the particle is made to remember its worst position also. This modification helps to explore the search space very effectively. In order to well exploit the promising solution region, a simple local random search (LRS) procedure is integrated with NPSO. The resultant NPSO-LRS algorithm is very effective in solving the nonconvex economic dispatch problems.

A second level of larger and more invariant features is obtained by training the same algorithm on patches of features from the first level. Training a supervised classifier on these features yields 0.64% error on MNIST, and 54% average recognition rate on Caltech 101 with 30 training samples per category.

In the literature, many sensorless schemes have been presented, in which the accurate estimation of rotor flux magnitude, position, and speed is guaranteed by detecting the back electromotive force (EMF). However, these schemes show great sensitivity to stator resistance mismatch and system noise, particularly, during low-speed operation. In this paper, an indirect-rotor-field-oriented-control scheme for sensorless speed control of a PMSM is proposed. The rotor-flux position is estimated by direct integration of the estimated rotor speed to reduce the effect of the system noise. The stator resistance and the rotor-flux speed and magnitude are estimated adaptively using stable model reference adaptive system estimators. Simple stability analysis and design of the estimators are performed using linear-control theory applied to an error model of the PMSM in a synchronous rotating reference frame. The convergence of rotor position- and speed-estimation errors to zero is guaranteed.

MTJs consist of two metal ferromagnets separated by a thin insulator and exhibit two resistances, low (Rp) or high (Rap) depending on the relative direction of ferromagnet magnetizations, parallel (P) or antiparallel (AP), respectively. Tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) ratios, defined as (Rap $Rp)/Rp as high as 361%, have been obtained in MTJs with Co40Fe40B20 fixed and free layers made by sputtering with an industry-standard exchange-bias structure and post deposition annealing at Ta = 400 degC. The corresponding output voltage swing DeltaV is over 500 mV, which is five times greater than that of the conventional amorphous Al-O-barrier MTJs. The highest TMR ratio obtained so far is 500% in a pseudospin-valve MTJ annealed at Ta = 475 degC, showing a high potential of the current material system. In addition to this high-output voltage swing, current-induced magnetization switching (CIMS) takes place at the critical current densities (JCO) on the order of 106 A/cm2 in these MgO-barrier MTJs. Furthermore, high antiferromagnetic coupling between the two CoFeB layers in a synthetic ferrimagnetic free layer has been shown to result in a high thermal-stability factor with a reduced JCO compared to single free-layer MTJs. The high TMR ratio enabled by the MgO-barrier MTJs, together with the demonstration of CIMS at a low JCO, allows development of not only scalable magnetoresistive random-access memory with feature sizes below 90 nm but also new memory-in-logic CMOS circuits that can overcome a number of bottlenecks in the current integrated-circuit architecture","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2007.894617","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4160113","CoFeB electrode;magnetoresistive random-access memories (MRAMs);memory-in-logic CMOS circuit;MgO barrier;spintronics;tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR)","","cobalt compounds;digital storage;integrated circuits;iron compounds;magnetoelectronics;sputtering;tunnelling magnetoresistance","magnetic tunnel junctions;spintronic memory;metal ferromagnets;ferromagnet magnetizations;tunnel magnetoresistance;exchange-bias structure;post deposition annealing;current-induced magnetization switching;critical current density;thermal-stability;magnetoresistive random-access memory;memory-in-logic CMOS circuits;spintronics;400 C;Co40Fe40B20","","355","","111","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The required rotor control voltage, which eliminates active and reactive power errors within each fixed time period, is directly calculated based on stator flux, rotor position, and active and reactive powers and their corresponding errors. No extra power or current control loops are required, simplifying the system design, and improving transient performance. Constant converter switching frequency is achieved that eases the design of the power converter and the ac harmonic filter. Rotor voltage limit during transients is investigated, and a scheme is proposed that prioritizes the active and reactive power control such that one remains fully controlled while the error of the other is reduced. The impact of machine parameter variations on system performance is investigated and found negligible.

An array of Sievenpiper's mushrooms constitutes the AMC part, while the PEC part is formed by full metallic patches. Around the operational frequency of the AMC-elements, the reflection of the AMC and PEC have opposite phase, so for any normal incident plane wave the reflections cancel out, thus reducing the RCS. The same applies to specular reflections for off-normal incidence angles. A simple basic model has been implemented in order to verify the behavior of this structure, while Ansoft-HFSS software has been used to provide a more thorough analysis.

The new distance can be easily computed through GLD with a complexity of O(|X| \cdot |Y|) and it is a metric valued in [0, 1] under the condition that the weight function is a metric over the set of elementary edit operations with all costs of insertions/deletions having the same weight.

Also presented are the results of bent fiber simulations using the beam propagation method (BPM), and experimental measurements of bend loss. Agreement among simulation, formula and measurement support the validity of both theoretical methods. BPM simulations showed that the lowest order modes of the bent fiber were reduced to their linearly polarized constituents prior to the onset of significant bend loss. This implies that certain LP mode orientations should propagate with much lower loss than previously expected, and should impact the mode stripping ability of bent large mode area fibers, as employed in fiber lasers and amplifiers.","1558-1713","","10.1109/JQE.2007.903364","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4300920","Dielectric waveguides;laser amplifiers;optical fiber amplifiers;optical fiber lasers;optical waveguide theory;waveguide bends","Optical fiber losses;Optical fibers;Optical fiber polarization;Optical waveguides;Optical propagation;Propagation losses;Loss measurement;Fiber lasers;Laser modes;Optical fiber amplifiers","optical fibre losses;optical fibre polarisation;waveguide discontinuities","bend loss formula;optical fiber;curvature loss;optical waveguides;single-mode fibers;multimode fibers;beam propagation method;linearly polarized constituents","","170","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Some CK class metrics have previously been shown to be good predictors of initial OO software quality. However, the other two suites have not been heavily validated except by their original proposers. Here, we explore the ability of these three metrics suites to predict fault-prone classes using defect data for six versions of Rhino, an open-source implementation of JavaScript written in Java. We conclude that the CK and QMOOD suites contain similar components and produce statistical models that are effective in detecting error-prone classes. We also conclude that the class components in the MOOD metrics suite are not good class fault-proneness predictors. Analyzing multivariate binary logistic regression models across six Rhino versions indicates these models may be useful in assessing quality in OO classes produced using modern highly iterative or agile software development processes.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2007.1015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4181709","Object-oriented software metrics;object-oriented metrics;software quality metrics;software maintenance programming;software reuse.","Software metrics;Programming;Software quality;Object oriented modeling;Mood;Java;Software maintenance;Computer industry;Open source software;Logistics","Java;object-oriented programming;regression analysis;software metrics;software quality","software metrics;fault-prone prediction;object-oriented class;iterative software development process;agile software development process;software quality;object-oriented design;JavaScript;statistical analysis;multivariate binary logistic regression model","","154","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose to apply this framework to image categorization where the input signals are images and where the underlying generative model is a visual vocabulary: a Gaussian mixture model which approximates the distribution of low-level features in images. We show that Fisher kernels can actually be understood as an extension of the popular bag-of-visterms. Our approach demonstrates excellent performance on two challenging databases: an in-house database of 19 object/scene categories and the recently released VOC 2006 database.

Considering that functional brain images do not normally convey detailed structural information and, thus, do not present an anatomically specific localization of functional activity, various image registration techniques are introduced in the literature for the purpose of mapping functional activity into an anatomical image or a brain atlas. The problems addressed by these techniques differ depending on the application and the type of analysis, i.e., single-subject versus group analysis. Functional to anatomical brain image registration is the core part of functional localization in most applications and is accompanied by intersubject and subject-to-atlas registration for group analysis studies. Cortical surface registration and automatic brain labeling are some of the other tools towards establishing a fully automatic functional localization procedure.

A representative single-stage grid-connected PV system, based on buck-boost converter topology operating in discontinuous current mode (DCM) with sine-triangle pulse width modulation (SPWM) and feeding sinusoidal power into the grid, is considered for this study. MPPT techniques are compared on the basis of the time taken to reach (track) the MPP, operating point oscillations in the vicinity of MPP and the dependence of the algorithms, if any, on array configuration and parameters. Comparison is also made on the basis of the energy extracted from the PV source during the transient tracking phase. In this context, an energy tracking factor term (ETF) is introduced and defined. It is observed that all the MPPT schemes studied have their own merits and demerits. The ripple correlation and beta methods offer an overall good combination of desirable features.

Accurate forecasts of wind generation are therefore paramount for reducing such penalties and thus maximizing revenue. Despite the fact that increasing accuracy in spot forecasts may reduce penalties, this paper shows that, if such forecasts are accompanied with information on their uncertainty, i.e., in the form of predictive distributions, then this can be the basis for defining advanced strategies for market participation. Such strategies permit to further increase revenues and thus enhance competitiveness of wind generation compared to other forms of dispatchable generation. This paper formulates a general methodology for deriving optimal bidding strategies based on probabilistic forecasts of wind generation, as well as on modeling of the sensitivity a wind power producer may have to regulation costs. The benefits resulting from the application of these strategies are clearly demonstrated on the test case of the participation of a multi-MW wind farm in the Dutch electricity market over a year.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2007.901117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4282048","Decision-making;energy markets;forecasting;uncertainty;wind energy","Wind forecasting;Wind power generation;Power generation;Wind energy generation;Wind energy;Economic forecasting;Electricity supply industry;Costs;Uncertainty;Predictive models","costing;load forecasting;power generation economics;power markets;wind power plants","wind generation trading;short-term probabilistic forecasts;liberalized electricity market;regulation costs;optimal bidding strategies;wind farm;Dutch electricity market","","341","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The traditional methods of analysis being tedious, many automated diagnostic systems for epilepsy have emerged in recent years. This paper proposes a neural-network-based automated epileptic EEG detection system that uses approximate entropy (ApEn) as the input feature. ApEn is a statistical parameter that measures the predictability of the current amplitude values of a physiological signal based on its previous amplitude values. It is known that the value of the ApEn drops sharply during an epileptic seizure and this fact is used in the proposed system. Two different types of neural networks, namely, Elman and probabilistic neural networks, are considered in this paper. ApEn is used for the first time in the proposed system for the detection of epilepsy using neural networks.

"Low Frequency Current Ripple Reduction Technique With Active Control in a Fuel Cell Power System With Inverter Load","C. Liu; J.

Such a ripple current may shorten fuel cell life span and worsen the fuel efficiency due to the hystersis effect. The most obvious impact is it tends to reduce the fuel cell output capacity because the fuel cell controller trips under instantaneous over-current condition. In this paper, the ripple current propagation path is analyzed, and its linearized ac model is derived. The equivalent circuit model and ripple current reduction with passive energy storage component are simulated and verified with experiments. An advanced active control technique is then proposed to incorporate a current control loop in the dc-dc converter for ripple reduction. The proposed active ripple reduction method has been verified with computer simulation and hardware experiment with a proton exchange membrane type fuel cell using a multiphase dc-dc converter along with a full-bridge dc-ac inverter. Test results with open loop, single voltage loop, and the proposed active current-loop control are provided for comparison.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2007.900594","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4267764","Fuel cell power system;fuel cell ripple reduction;low frequency current ripple","Frequency;Control systems;Fuel cells;Power system control;Power systems;Inverters;DC-DC power converters;Equivalent circuits;Energy storage;Computational modeling","DC-DC power convertors;equivalent circuits;fuel cell power plants;invertors;proton exchange membrane fuel cells","low frequency current ripple reduction;active control;fuel cell power system;inverter load;single-phase dc-ac inverter;ac ripple current;ripple current propagation path;linearized ac model;equivalent circuit model;current control loop;dc-dc converter;proton exchange membrane","","210","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The high front-to-back (F/B) ratio (up to 15 dB) is attributed to the constructive interference that takes place between the individual printed Yagi arrays in the design. Through the spacing of the elements, the directivity (between 9-11.5 dBi) and the F/B ratio can be altered to suit the application of interest. The operational principles of this design are discussed to give insight on the radiation mechanism of the antenna. An initial design at around 32.5 GHz is presented to show the performance capabilities of this configuration. An impedance bandwidth of 8.3% can be achieved around this frequency. Then, a parametric analysis is conducted to estimate the significance of the design parameters that affect the antenna's performance. Finally, measured return loss and radiation pattern performance at 5.2 GHz is displayed to validate the principles and simulated results of the design. The measured impedance bandwidth of 10% is achieved. The F/B ratio is 15 dB which is larger than values previously published by 5-10 dB. Additionally, a gain of 10.7 dBi is observed.

Unfortunately, beamforming requires the transmitter to have knowledge of the forward-link channel which is often not available a priori. One way of overcoming this problem is to design the beamforming vector using a limited number of feedback bits sent from the receiver to the transmitter. In limited feedback beamforming, the beamforming vector is restricted to lie in a codebook that is known to both the transmitter and receiver. Random vector quantization (RVQ) is a simple approach to codebook design that generates the vectors independently from a uniform distribution on the complex unit sphere.

However, the operation of the machine in these situations has only been studied in the literature by means of simulations. This paper develops a theoretical analysis of the dynamic behavior of the induction machine during three-phase voltage dips.

The registration loops over a series of decreasing stiffness weights, and incrementally deforms the template towards the target, recovering the whole range of global and local deformations. To find the optimal deformation for a given stiffness, optimal iterative closest point steps are used. Preliminary correspondences are estimated by a nearest-point search. Then the optimal deformation of the template for these fixed correspondences and the active stiffness is calculated. Afterwards the process continues with new correspondences found by searching from the displaced template vertices. We present an algorithm using a locally affine regularisation which assigns an affine transformation to each vertex and minimises the difference in the transformation of neighbouring vertices. It is shown that for this regularisation the optimal deformation for fixed correspondences and fixed stiffness can be determined exactly and efficiently. The method succeeds for a wide range of initial conditions, and handles missing data robustly. It is compared qualitatively and quantitatively to other algorithms using synthetic examples and real world data.","1063-6919","1-4244-1179-3","10.1109/CVPR.2007.383165","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4270190","","Iterative closest point algorithm;Iterative algorithms;Convergence;Head;Scholarships;Humans;Noise robustness;Shape;Material properties;Smoothing methods","affine transforms;image registration;iterative methods","optimal step nonrigid ICP algorithm;surface registration;nonrigid registration;registration loops;optimal iterative closest point steps;nearest-point search;affine regularisation;affine transformation","","219","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These characteristics shed light on the key routing performance metrics of interest in disconnected VANETs, such as the average time taken to propagate a packet to disconnected nodes (i.e., the re-healing time). Our results show that, depending on the sparsity of vehicles or the market penetration rate of cars using Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) technology, the network re-healing time can vary from a few seconds to several minutes. This suggests that, for vehicular safety applications, a new ad hoc routing protocol will be needed as the conventional ad hoc routing protocols such as Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV) will not work with such long re-healing times.

The antenna's operational frequency depends only on its unit-cell and the antenna's physical size depends on the number of unit-cells. In particular, the unit-cell is based on the composite right/left-handed (CRLH) metamaterial transmission line (TL). It is shown that the CRLH TL is a general model for the required unit-cell, which includes a nonessential series capacitance for the generation of an infinite wavelength.

Moreover, the dc optimal power flow (DCOPF) model has been applied in the power industry to calculate locational marginal prices (LMPs), especially in market simulation and planning owing to its robustness and speed. In this paper, first, an iterative DCOPF-based algorithm is presented with the fictitious nodal demand (FND) model to calculate LMP. The algorithm has three features: the iterative approach is employed to address the nonlinear marginal loss; FND is proposed to eliminate the large mismatch at the reference bus if FND is not applied; and an offset of system loss in the energy balance equation is proved to be necessary because the net injection multiplied by marginal delivery factors creates doubled system loss. Second, the algorithm is compared with ACOPF algorithm for accuracy of LMP results at various load levels using the PJM 5-bus system. It is clearly shown that the FND algorithm is a good estimate of the LMP calculated from the ACOPF algorithm and outperforms the lossless DCOPF algorithm. Third, the DCOPF-based algorithm is employed to analyze the sensitivity of LMP with respect to the system load.

Emerging state-of-the-art switching supplies, in fact, are now exploring ways to use this sensed-current information to improve transient response, power efficiency, and compensation performance by appropriately self-adjusting, on the fly, frequency, inductor ripple current, switching configuration (e.g., synchronous to/from asynchronous), and other operating parameters. The discontinuous, non-integrated, and inaccurate nature of existing lossless current-sensing schemes, however, impedes their widespread adoption, and lossy solutions are not acceptable. Lossless, filter-based techniques are continuous, but inaccurate when integrated on-chip because of the inherent mismatches between the filter and the power inductor. The proposed GM-C filter-based, fully integrated current-sensing CMOS scheme circumvents this accuracy limitation by introducing a self-learning sequence to start-up and power-on-reset. During these seldom-occurring events, the gain and bandwidth of the internal filter are matched to the response of the power inductor and its equivalent series resistance (ESR), effectively measuring their values. A 0.5 mum CMOS realization of the proposed scheme was fabricated and applied to a current-mode buck switching supply, achieving overall DC and AC current-gain errors of 8% and 9%, respectively, at 0.8 A DC load and 0.2 A ripple currents for 3.5 muH-14 muH inductors with ESRs ranging from 48 mOmega to 384 mOmega (other lossless, state-of-the-art solutions achieve 20%-40% error, and only when the nominal specifications of the power MOSFET and/or inductor are known). Since the self-learning sequence is non-recurring, the power losses associated with the foregoing solution are minimal, translating to a 2.6% power efficiency savings when compared to the more traditional but accurate series-sense resistor (e.g., 50 mOmega) technique.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2006.891721","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4114749","Current-mode;current sensing;DC-DC converters;G $_{\rm M}$-C filter;inductance measurement;lossless;power management;self-learning;switching regulators","DC-DC power converters;Inductors;Filters;Paramagnetic resonance;Power supplies;Feedback circuits;Protection;Feedback control;Transient response;Frequency","CMOS integrated circuits;DC-DC power convertors;inductors;power supply circuits","CMOS current-sensing scheme;inductor-based DC-DC converters;power supply circuits;transient response;power efficiency;inductor ripple current;power inductor;equivalent series resistance;current-mode buck switching supply;DC current-gain errors;AC current-gain errors;power MOSFET;series-sense resistor technique;GM-C filter;inductance measurement;power management;switching regulators;0.2 A;0.8 A;48 to 384 mohm;0.5 micron","","80","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Through detailed analysis, the paper identifies several phenomena on the dc and ac-sides of the inverter, which would result in the inverter having a non-minimum-phase transient response. The dc-side phenomenon is associated with the Z-source impedance network, which is shown through small-signal and signal-flow-graph analyses to be having a right-half-plane zero in its control-to-output transfer function. Also, the ac-side phenomenon is shown through space vector analysis to depend on the time intervals of inverter states used for reconstructing the desired inverter output voltage. Based on the ac vectorial analysis, a method for improving the inverter transient response is also presented.

These internal self-similarities are efficiently captured by a compact local ""self-similarity descriptor""', measured densely throughout the image/video, at multiple scales, while accounting for local and global geometric distortions. This gives rise to matching capabilities of complex visual data, including detection of objects in real cluttered images using only rough hand-sketches, handling textured objects with no clear boundaries, and detecting complex actions in cluttered video data with no prior learning.

Here, channel width required for layout is easily found and implicitly considered in performance expressions. This paper gives hand expressions motivated by the EKV MOS model and measured data for MOS device performance, inclusive of velocity saturation and other small-geometry effects. A simple spreadsheet tool is then used to predict MOS device performance and map this into complete circuit performance. Tradeoffs and optimization of performance are illustrated by the design of three, 0.18-μm CMOS operational transconductance amplifiers optimized for DC, balanced, and AC performance.

Although latent print examiners frequently take advantage of level 3 features to assist in identification, automated fingerprint identification systems (AFIS) currently rely only on level 1 and level 2 features. In fact, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) standard of fingerprint resolution for AFIS is 500 pixels per inch (ppi), which is inadequate for capturing level 3 features, such as pores. With the advances in fingerprint sensing technology, many sensors are now equipped with dual resolution (500 ppi/1,000 ppi) scanning capability. However, increasing the scan resolution alone does not necessarily provide any performance improvement in fingerprint matching, unless an extended feature set is utilized. As a result, a systematic study to determine how much performance gain one can achieve by introducing level 3 features in AFIS is highly desired. We propose a hierarchical matching system that utilizes features at all the three levels extracted from 1,000 ppi fingerprint scans. Level 3 features, including pores and ridge contours, are automatically extracted using Gabor filters and wavelet transform and are locally matched using the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. Our experiments show that level 3 features carry significant discriminatory information. There is a relative reduction of 20 percent in the equal error rate (EER) of the matching system when level 3 features are employed in combination with level 1 and 2 features.

We show that in the high Signal-to- interference Ratios (SIR) regime, these nonlinear and apparently difficult, nonconvex optimization problems can be transformed into convex optimization problems in the form of geometric programming; hence they can be very efficiently solved for global optimality even with a large number of users. In the medium to low SIR regime, some of these constrained nonlinear optimization of power control cannot be turned into tractable convex formulations, but a heuristic can be used to compute in most cases the optimal solution by solving a series of geometric programs through the approach of successive convex approximation.

This fading can be mitigated by the use of antenna diversity, and gains of up to 10 dB are obtained. Separation of the antenna's performance from the channel characteristics is difficult, but results show that for many channels, an antenna polarized normal to the body's surface gives the best path gain.

To obtain appropriate estimates, notably reduced efficiencies at part load, start-up costs, and reserve power requirements are taken into account. The latter are endogenously modeled by applying a probabilistic method. The intermittency of wind is covered by a stochastic recombining tree and the system is considered to adapt on increasing wind integration over time by endogenous modeling of investments in selected thermal power plants and CAES.

Unfortunately, there may be insufficient resources to allow for the reexecution of all test cases during regression testing. In this situation, test case prioritization techniques aim to improve the effectiveness of regression testing by ordering the test cases so that the most beneficial are executed first. Previous work on regression test case prioritization has focused on greedy algorithms. However, it is known that these algorithms may produce suboptimal results because they may construct results that denote only local minima within the search space. By contrast, metaheuristic and evolutionary search algorithms aim to avoid such problems. This paper presents results from an empirical study of the application of several greedy, metaheuristic, and evolutionary search algorithms to six programs, ranging from 374 to 11,148 lines of code for three choices of fitness metric. The paper addresses the problems of choice of fitness metric, characterization of landscape modality, and determination of the most suitable search technique to apply. The empirical results replicate previous results concerning greedy algorithms. They shed light on the nature of the regression testing search space, indicating that it is multimodal. The results also show that genetic algorithms perform well, although greedy approaches are surprisingly effective, given the multimodal nature of the landscape","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2007.38","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4123325","Search techniques;test case prioritization;regression testing.","Greedy algorithms;Cost function;Genetic algorithms;Software testing;Libraries;Fault detection","genetic algorithms;greedy algorithms;program testing;search problems","regression testing;test case prioritization technique;greedy algorithm;metaheuristics;evolutionary search algorithm;fitness metric;genetic algorithm","","332","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The nonlinear dynamics of the original EEGs are quantified in the form of the correlation dimension (CD, representing system complexity) and the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE, representing system chaoticity). The new wavelet-based methodology isolates the changes in CD and LLE in specific subbands of the EEG. The methodology is applied to three different groups of EEG signals: 1) healthy subjects; 2) epileptic subjects during a seizure-free interval (interictal EEG); 3) epileptic subjects during a seizure (ictal EEG). The effectiveness of CD and LLE in differentiating between the three groups is investigated based on statistical significance of the differences. It is observed that while there may not be significant differences in the values of the parameters obtained from the original EEG, differences may be identified when the parameters are employed in conjunction with specific EEG subbands.

Expressions for the outage probability are derived for a variety of atmospheric conditions. For given weather and misalignment conditions, the beam width is optimized to maximize the channel capacity subject to outage. Large gains in achievable rate are realized versus using a nominal beam width. In light fog, by optimizing the beam width, the achievable rate is increased by 80% over the nominal beam width at an outage probability of 10-5.

The method is designed to handle the special characteristics of hyperspectral images, namely, high-input dimension of pixels, low number of labeled samples, and spatial variability of the spectral signature. To alleviate these problems, the method incorporates three ingredients, respectively. First, being a kernel-based method, it combats the curse of dimensionality efficiently. Second, following a semi-supervised approach, it exploits the wealth of unlabeled samples in the image, and naturally gives relative importance to the labeled ones through a graph-based methodology. Finally, it incorporates contextual information through a full family of composite kernels. Noting that the graph method relies on inverting a huge kernel matrix formed by both labeled and unlabeled samples, we originally introduce the Nystro umlm method in the formulation to speed up the classification process. The presented semi-supervised-graph-based method is compared to state-of-the-art support vector machines in the classification of hyperspectral data. The proposed method produces better classification maps, which capture the intrinsic structure collectively revealed by labeled and unlabeled points. Good and stable accuracy is produced in ill-posed classification problems (high dimensional spaces and low number of labeled samples). In addition, the introduction of the composite-kernel framework drastically improves results, and the new fast formulation ranks almost linearly in the computational cost, rather than cubic as in the original method, thus allowing the use of this method in remote-sensing applications.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2007.895416","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4305352","Composite kernel;graph Laplacian;hyperspectral image classification;ill-posed problem;NystrÖm method;semi-supervised learning (SSL);undirected graph","Hyperspectral imaging;Image classification;Hyperspectral sensors;Kernel;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Remote sensing;Robustness;Costs;Labeling","geophysical signal processing;graph theory;image classification;multidimensional signal processing;spectral analysis;support vector machines;terrain mapping","semisupervised graph-based hyperspectral image classification;high-input pixel dimension;spatial variability;spectral signature;kernel-based method;contextual information;composite kernels;kernel matrix;Nystrom method;support vector machine;classification map;remote sensing","","396","","52","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One challenge for such detection in single channel receivers is demodulation sensitivity to target position, which can be overcome by using a quadrature receiver. This paper presents a mathematical analysis and experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of arctangent demodulation in quadrature receivers. A particular challenge in this technique is the presence of dc offset resulting from receiver imperfections and clutter reflections, in addition to dc information related to target position and associated phase. These dc components can be large compared to the ac motion-related signal, and thus, cannot simply be included in digitization without adversely affecting resolution. Presented here is a method for calibrating the dc offset while preserving the dc information and capturing the motion-related signal with maximum resolution.

"11E-2 Review and Comparison of Bulk Acoustic Wave FBAR, SMR Technology","R. Ruby","AvagoTechnol., San Jose","2007 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium Proceedings","","2007","","","1029","1040","Since FBAR (free-standing bulk acoustic resonator) and solidly mounted resonator SMR-BAW devices came onto the scene as serious competition to the entrenched SAW technology (for cell phone applications), there has been much speculation and discussion as to which of these two ""disruptive"" technologies is the superior one. The one fundamental difference between SMR-BAWs and FBARs, is the means by which the acoustic energy is trapped. For FBAR the air/crystal interface on both faces of the resonator ensures that the main mode of interest (the thickness extensional mode, TE1) is appropriately trapped In the SMR-BAW, Bragg reflectors underneath the resonator, effectively trap this mode. This addition of a Bragg reflector will degrade the effective coupling coefficient as well as creating additional Q loss mechanisms. The science of improving Q must focus on the edges of the resonator for FBAR, while for SMR devices, both the edges and the vertical design of the Bragg reflector must be optimized. That said, compared to conventional SAW technology, both BAW and FBAR provide temperature stability, power handling capability, good ESD (electro-static discharge), and -most important-high Q's. One of the key drivers for the success (in terms of high Q and coupling coefficients) of both BAW and FBAR was the exploitation of AlN as the piezoelectric material and high acoustic impedance, electrode materials such as molybdenum, tungsten or ruthenium.

Tian's difference-expansion technique is a high-capacity, reversible method for data embedding. However, the method suffers from undesirable distortion at low embedding capacities and lack of capacity control due to the need for embedding a location map. We propose a histogram shifting technique as an alternative to embedding the location map. The proposed technique improves the distortion performance at low embedding capacities and mitigates the capacity control problem. We also propose a reversible data-embedding technique called prediction-error expansion. This new technique better exploits the correlation inherent in the neighborhood of a pixel than the difference-expansion scheme. Prediction-error expansion and histogram shifting combine to form an effective method for data embedding. The experimental results for many standard test images show that prediction-error expansion doubles the maximum embedding capacity when compared to difference expansion. There is also a significant improvement in the quality of the watermarked image, especially at moderate embedding capacities","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2006.891046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4099409","Content authentication;difference expansion (DE);digital watermarking;expansion embedding;prediction-error expansion;reversible watermarking","Watermarking;Histograms;Testing;Authentication;Payloads;Image coding;Digital video broadcasting;Digital audio broadcasting;Biomedical monitoring;Biomedical imaging","image coding;watermarking","expansion embedding techniques;reversible watermarking;Tian difference-expansion technique;reversible data-embedding technique;embedding capacities;capacity control problem;histogram shifting technique;prediction-error expansion","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Computer Security;Data Compression;Hypermedia;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Patents as Topic;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Product Labeling;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","703","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The network reconfiguration algorithm is based on the fuzzy multiobjective approach and the max-min principle is adopted for the multiobjective optimization in a fuzzy framework. Multiple objectives are considered for real-power loss reduction in which nodes voltage deviation is kept within a range, and an absolute value of branch currents is not allowed to exceed their rated capacities. At the same time, a radial network structure is maintained with all loads energized.

This paper presents results from an investigation of failure statistics from four sources, i.e., two separate sources from Sweden, one from Finland, and one from Germany. Statistics reveal reliability performance of the different components within the wind turbine. The gearbox is the most critical, because downtime per failure is high compared to the other components.

Simulated results for an infinite array of stripline-fed Vivaldi elements on εr=6 substrate performs well for scan to 45° and frequency 1.8-18 GHz. Vivaldi antenna elements are typically 2-3 wavelengths long at the highest frequency of the array. The addition of a properly designed cover (radome) to an array of relatively short Vivaldi antennas can improve its performance over bandwidths on the order of 2:1. Broadside and scanned performance are improved by the cover. Gaps between elements of the array would be desirable so the array can be assembled and repaired by inserting independent modules. However, gaps between the elements cause resonances that destroy the array's wideband performance. The balanced antipodal Vivaldi antenna (BAVA) can be fabricated in modules and by introducing double mirroring, undesirable resonances can be controlled to provide two octaves of frequency operation. The use of Vivaldi antenna arrays for very short pulse systems requires that the antenna not only be well matched over a wide band of frequencies but it must also preserve pulse shape. The dispersive properties of Vivaldi arrays have been investigated and it is found that dielectric substrates, which improve the VSWR bandwidth of the antenna, slightly increase the array's delay dispersion.","0537-9989","978-0-86341-842-6","10.1049/ic.2007.1334","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4458457","Wideband array;Vivaldi;BAVA;Dispersion","","antenna arrays;antenna feeds;radomes;strip lines","Vivaldi antenna arrays;electronic scanning;stripline-fed Vivaldi elements;radome;balanced antipodal Vivaldi antenna;short pulse systems;dielectric substrates;VSWR bandwidth;array delay dispersion;wide bandwidth;frequency 1.8 GHz to 18 GHz","","57","","","","","","","IET","IET Conferences"

An automatic parameter selection method is also introduced, to facilitate the adaptation of the model parameters to a vast variety of ECGs. This approach is evaluated on several normal ECGs, by artificially adding white and colored Gaussian noises to visually inspected clean ECG recordings, and studying the SNR and morphology of the filter outputs. The results of the study demonstrate superior results compared with conventional ECG denoising approaches such as bandpass filtering, adaptive filtering, and wavelet denoising, over a wide range of ECG SNRs. The method is also successfully evaluated on real nonstationary muscle artifact.

Such devices are of particular interest if they are compatible with back-end-of-line processing for CMOS integrated circuits. A variety of resistance-change technologies show promise in this respect, but a new approach that is based on switching in copper-doped silicon dioxide may be the simplest and least expensive to integrate. This paper describes the characteristics of W-(Cu/SiO2)-Cu programmable metallization cell (PMC) devices formed by the thermal diffusion of Cu into deposited SiO2. PMC devices operate by the electrochemical control of metallic pathways in solid electrolytes. Both unipolar and bipolar resistive switching could be attained in these devices. Bipolar switching, which is identical to that seen in PMC devices based on other solid electrolytes, was observed for low bias (a few tenths of volts) and programming currents in the microampere range. The resistance ratio between high and low states was on the order of 103, and a multibit storage is considered possible via the strong dependence of ON-state resistance on programming current. The low and high resistance states were stable for more than 5 x 104 s. The devices could be made to exhibit unipolar switching using a negative bias on the order of -1 V combined with erase currents of hundreds of microampere to a few milliampere. In this case, the OFF/ON ratio was 106.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2007.904402","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4317748","Electrical switching;nonvolatile memory;silicon oxide;solid electrolytes","Switches;Copper;Solids;Resistance;Electrodes;Voltage control","CMOS memory circuits;copper;integrated circuit metallisation;low-power electronics;oxygen compounds;programmable circuits;semiconductor doping;silicon compounds;switching;thermal diffusion","Cu-SiO2 - Interface;bipolar resistive switching;unipolar resistive switching;scalable nonvolatile memory devices;low voltage;low current;multilevel cell capability;simple circuitry;back-end-of-line processing;CMOS integrated circuits;resistance-change technologies;copper-doped silicon dioxide;programmable metallization cell devices;thermal diffusion;electrochemical control;metallic pathways;solid electrolytes","","287","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Eng., Texas Univ., Austin, TX","IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","","2007","6","1","69","73","Distributed antenna systems (DAS) have been widely implemented in state-of-the art cellular communication systems to cover dead spots. Recent academic studies have shown that in addition to coverage improvements, DAS can also have potential advantages such as reduced power and increased system capacity in a single cell environment. This paper analytically quantifies downlink capacity of multicell DAS for two different transmission strategies: selection diversity (where just one or two of the distributed antennas are used) and blanket transmission (where all antennas in the cell broadcast data). Simple repeaters are a special case of our analysis. A generalized information theoretic analysis is provided to illuminate the fundamental limits of such systems in the cellular context. The results show that DAS reduces other-cell interference in a multicell environment and hence significantly improves capacity (by about 2x), with particularly large improvements for users near cell boundaries. Less obviously, from a communication theory standpoint, it is shown that selection diversity is preferable to blanket transmission in terms of achievable ergodic capacity. For blanket transmission, we show that the optimal transmission strategy is just phase steering due to the per antenna module power constraints in DAS","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2007.05207","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4114255","","Downlink;Interference;Transmitting antennas;Wireless communication;Radio frequency;Base stations;Performance analysis;Multiaccess communication;Computer simulation;Art","antenna arrays;cellular radio;diversity reception","downlink performance;distributed antenna systems;multicell environment;state-of-the art cellular communication systems;dead spots;system capacity;single cell environment;downlink capacity;selection diversity;blanket transmission;information theoretic analysis;other-cell interference;communication theory;achievable ergodic capacity;optimal transmission strategy;phase steering;per antenna module power constraints","","433","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The filter consists of five short-circuited stubs separated by nonredundant connecting lines in order to exhibit a high selectivity filtering characteristic. The narrow notched (rejection) band was introduced by using a new technique which involves embedding open stubs in the first and last connecting lines in order to reject any undesired existing radio signal which may interfere with the determined UWB passband. The bandwidth of the notched filter can be controlled by adjusting the width of the stubs or the gaps or both. The length of the stubs can be tuned to select a specific frequency for the notched band. The embedded stubs can be used to excite single or double band-reject response. Two UWB BPFs with narrow notched band having a fractional bandwidth (FBW) of about 4.6% and 6.5% were realized theoretically and verified by full-wave EM simulation and the experiment.

The resulting wide voltage variation due to UC power transfer is addressed by the simple modulator that is introduced in this paper, so that the motor drive performance is not disrupted. Based on this new methodology, this paper further introduces two ESS schemes with different topologies, namely 1) UC rating and 2) energy flow control.

This generalizes the standard sparse representation problem to the case where multiple responses exist that were putatively generated by the same small subset of features. Ideally, the associated sparse generating weights should be recovered, which can have physical significance in many applications (e.g., source localization). The generic solution to this problem is intractable and, therefore, approximate procedures are sought. Based on the concept of automatic relevance determination, this paper uses an empirical Bayesian prior to estimate a convenient posterior distribution over candidate basis vectors. This particular approximation enforces a common sparsity profile and consistently places its prominent posterior mass on the appropriate region of weight-space necessary for simultaneous sparse recovery. The resultant algorithm is then compared with multiple response extensions of matching pursuit, basis pursuit, FOCUSS, and Jeffreys prior-based Bayesian methods, finding that it often outperforms the others. Additional motivation for this particular choice of cost function is also provided, including the analysis of global and local minima and a variational derivation that highlights the similarities and differences between the proposed algorithm and previous approaches.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2007.894265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4244754","Automatic relevance determination;empirical Bayes;multiple response models;simultaneous sparse approximation;sparse Bayesian learning;variable selection","Bayesian methods;Matching pursuit algorithms;Dictionaries;Signal generators;Pursuit algorithms;Focusing;Cost function;Algorithm design and analysis;Input variables;Design for experiments","Bayes methods;learning (artificial intelligence);maximum likelihood estimation;signal representation","sparse representation problem;sparse Bayesian learning;local minima;global minima;cost function;posterior distribution;automatic relevance determination;source localization;coefficient expansions;signal vectors;simultaneous sparse approximation problem;empirical Bayesian strategy","","398","","57","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Solid state spectral information is available in the submillimeter region making it possible to identify materials, whereas in millimeter region bulk optical properties determine the image contrast. The optical properties in the region from 30 GHz to 3 THz are discussed for some typical inorganic and organic solids. In the millimeter-wave region of the spectrum, obscurants such as poor weather, dust, and smoke can be penetrated and useful imagery generated for surveillance. In the 30 GHz-3 THz region dielectrics such as plastic and cloth are also transparent and the detection of contraband hidden under clothing is possible. A passive millimeter-wave imaging concept based on a folded Schmidt camera has been developed and applied to poor weather navigation and security. The optical design uses a rotating mirror and is folded using polarization techniques. The design is very well corrected over a wide field of view making it ideal for surveillance and security.

Auditory scene analysis, content-based retrieval, indexing, and fingerprinting of audio are few of the applications that require efficient feature extraction. The key to extract strong features that characterize the complex nature of audio signals is to identify their discriminatory subspaces. In this paper, we propose an audio feature extraction and a multigroup classification scheme that focuses on identifying discriminatory time-frequency subspaces using the local discriminant bases (LDB) technique. Two dissimilarity measures were used in the process of selecting the LDB nodes and extracting features from them. The extracted features were then fed to a linear discriminant analysis-based classifier for a three-level hierarchical classification of audio signals into ten classes. In the first level, the audio signals were grouped into artificial and natural sounds. Each of the first level groups were subdivided to form the second level groups viz. instrumental, automobile, human, and nonhuman sounds. The third level was formed by subdividing the four groups of the second level into the final ten groups (drums, flute, piano, aircraft, helicopter, male, female, animals, birds and insects). A database of 213 audio signals were used in this study and an average classification accuracy of 83% for the first level (113 artificial and 100 natural sounds), 92% for the second level (73 instrumental and 40 automobile sounds; 40 human and 60 nonhuman sounds), and 89% for the third level (27 drums, 15 flute, and 31 piano sounds; 23 aircraft and 17 helicopter sounds; 20 male and 20 female speech; 20 animals, 20 birds and 20 insects sounds) were achieved. In addition to the above, a separate classification was also performed combining the LDB features with the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. The average classification accuracies achieved using the combined features were 91% for the first level, 99% for the second level, and 95% for the third level","1558-7924","","10.1109/TASL.2006.885921","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4156221","Audio classification;dissimilarity measures;feature extraction;linear discriminant analysis (LDA);local discriminant bases (LDB);wavelet packets","Feature extraction;Instruments;Automobiles;Humans;Aircraft;Helicopters;Animals;Birds;Insects;Image analysis","audio signal processing;feature extraction","audio signal feature extraction;local discriminant bases;audio content;auditory scene analysis;content-based retrieval;indexing;audio fingerprinting;multigroup classification scheme;time-frequency subspaces;three-level hierarchical classification;mel-frequency cepstral coefficients","","56","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This poses a significant security risk for ICs used for critical military and business applications. Attackers can exploit this loss of control to substitute Trojan ICs for genuine ones or insert a Trojan circuit into the design or mask used for fabrication. We show that a technique borrowed from side-channel cryptanalysis can be used to mitigate this problem. Our approach uses noise modeling to construct a set of fingerprints/or an IC family utilizing side- channel information such as power, temperature, and electromagnetic (EM) profiles. The set of fingerprints can be developed using a few ICs from a batch and only these ICs would have to be invasively tested to ensure that they were all authentic. The remaining ICs are verified using statistical tests against the fingerprints. We describe the theoretical framework and present preliminary experimental results to show that this approach is viable by presenting results obtained by using power simulations performed on representative circuits with several different Trojan circuitry. These results show that Trojans that are 3-4 orders of magnitude smaller than the main circuit can be detected by signal processing techniques. While scaling our technique to detect even smaller Trojans in complex ICs with tens or hundreds of millions of transistors would require certain modifications to the IC design process, our results provide a starting point to address this important problem.","2375-1207","0-7695-2848-1","10.1109/SP.2007.36","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4223234","","Fingerprint recognition;Fabrication;Integrated circuit noise;Integrated circuit modeling;Circuit testing;Hardware;Manufacturing;Outsourcing;Costs;Security","circuit analysis computing;cryptography;integrated circuit manufacture;invasive software","Trojan detection;IC fingerprinting;security risk;side-channel cryptanalysis;noise modeling;side-channel information;power simulations","","383","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since vehicles have various colors under different weather and lighting conditions, seldom works were proposed for the detection of vehicles using colors. The proposed new color transform model has excellent capabilities to identify vehicle pixels from background, even though the pixels are lighted under varying illuminations. After finding possible vehicle candidates, three important features, including corners, edge maps, and coefficients of wavelet transforms, are used for constructing a cascade multichannel classifier. According to this classifier, an effective scanning can be performed to verify all possible candidates quickly. The scanning process can be quickly achieved because most background pixels are eliminated in advance by the color feature.

Second, a transducer structure, cymbal, was optimized and fabricated to match the mechanical impedance of vibration source to that of the piezoelectric transducer. The cymbal transducer was found to exhibit ~40 times higher effective strain coefficient than the piezoelectric ceramics. Third, the electrical impedance matching for the energy harvesting circuit was considered to allow the transfer of generated power to a storage media. It was found that, by using the 10-layer ceramics instead of the single layer, the output current can be increased by 10 times, and the output load can be reduced by 40 times. Furthermore, by using the multilayer ceramics the output power was found to increase by 100%.

To stabilize this set we study a class of feedback rules that are implementable with local information available to each member. When the information flow between neighboring members is bidirectional, we show that the closed-loop system exhibits a special interconnection structure which inherits the passivity properties of its components. By exploiting this structure we develop a passivity-based design framework, which results in a broad class of feedback rules that encompass as special cases some of the existing formation stabilization and group agreement designs in the literature. The passivity approach offers additional design flexibility compared to these special cases, and systematically constructs a Lurie-type Lyapunov function for the closed-loop system. We further study the robustness of these feedback laws in the presence of a time-varying communication topology, and present a persistency of excitation condition which allows the interconnection graph to lose connectivity pointwise in time as long as it is established in an integral sense.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2007.902733","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4287131","Cooperative systems;distributed control;Lyapunov methods;passivity","Feedback;Lyapunov method;Stability;Vehicles;Robustness;Topology;Distributed control;Robot sensing systems;Robot kinematics","closed loop systems;control system synthesis;feedback;graph theory;Lyapunov methods;robust control;time-varying systems","group coordination;stability;feedback rule;closed-loop system;passivity-based design framework;Lurie-type Lyapunov function;robust control;time-varying communication topology;interconnection graph","","518","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Estimation of Rapidly Time-Varying Sparse Channels","W. Li; J. C. Preisig","Massachusetts Inst. of Technol., Cambridge; NA","IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","","2007","32","4","927","939","The estimation of sparse shallow-water acoustic communication channels and the impact of estimation performance on the equalization of phase coherent communication signals are investigated. Given sufficiently wide transmission bandwidth, the impulse response of the shallow-water acoustic channel is often sparse as the multipath arrivals become resolvable. In the presence of significant surface waves, the multipath arrivals associated with surface scattering fluctuate rapidly over time, in the sense that the complex gain, the arrival time, and the Dopplers of each arrival all change dynamically. A sparse channel estimation technique is developed based on the delay-Doppler-spread function representation of the channel. The delay-Doppler-spread function may be considered as a first-order approximation to the rapidly time-varying channel in which each channel component is associated with Doppler shifts that are assumed constant over an averaging interval. The sparse structure of the delay-Doppler-spread function is then exploited by sequentially choosing the dominant components that minimize a least squares error. The advantage of this approach is that it captures both the channel structure as well as its dynamics without the need of explicit dynamic channel modeling. As the symbols are populated with the sample Dopplers, the increase in complexity depends on the channel Doppler spread and can be significant for a severely Doppler-spread channel. Comparison is made between nonsparse recursive least squares (RLS) channel estimation, sparse channel impulse response estimation, and estimation using the proposed approach. The results are demonstrated using experimental data. In training mode, the proposed approach shows a 3-dB reduction in signal prediction error. In decision-directed mode, it improves significantly the robustness of the performance of the channel-estimate-based equalizer against rapid channel fluctuations.","1558-1691","","10.1109/JOE.2007.906409","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4445731","Channel-estimate-based equalization;delay-Doppler-spread function;matching pursuit;sparse estimation;time-varying channels","Phase estimation;Surface acoustic waves;Channel estimation;Delay;Least squares approximation;Recursive estimation;Communication channels;Bandwidth;Signal resolution;Acoustic scattering","approximation theory;channel estimation;Doppler shift;equalisers;least squares approximations;surface scattering;time-varying channels;transient response;underwater acoustic communication","time-varying sparse channel estimation;shallow-water acoustic communication;phase coherent communication signal equalization;impulse response;surface scattering;delay-Doppler-spread function representation;first-order approximation;Doppler shift;least squares error minimization;signal prediction error;equalizer","","257","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The design adopts inverter buffered xor/xnor designs to alleviate the threshold voltage loss problem commonly encountered in pass transistor logic design. This problem usually prevents the full adder design from operating in low supply voltage or cascading directly without extra buffering. The proposed design successfully embeds the buffering circuit in the full adder design and the transistor count is minimized. The improved buffering helps the design operate under lower supply voltage compared with existing works. It also enhances the speed performance of the cascaded operation significantly while maintaining the performance edge in energy consumption. For performance comparison, both dc andperformances of the proposed design against various full adder designs are evaluated via extensive HSPICE simulations. The simulation results, based on TSMC 2P4M 0.35-mum process models, indicate that the proposed design has the lowest working Vdd and highest working frequency among all designs using ten transistors.

These rules have the advantage of not requiring a central authority that verifies compliance to the protocol. Any self-enforcing protocol must correspond to an equilibrium of a game. We first analyze the possible outcomes of a one shot game, and observe that in many cases an inefficient solution results. However, systems often coexist for long periods and a repeated game is more appropriate to model their interaction. In this repeated game the possibility of building reputations and applying punishments allows for a larger set of self-enforcing outcomes. When this set includes the optimal operating point, efficient, fair, and incentive compatible spectrum sharing becomes possible.

The feedback techniques shed geometric insight into link design and minimize algebraic manipulations. We demonstrate that when the loop transmission of the link's feedback loop is -1, the link is critically coupled, i.e., the magnitude of the voltage transfer function across the link is maximal. We also derive an optimal loading condition that maximizes the energy efficiency of the link and use it as a basis for our link design. We present an example of a bionic implant system designed for load power consumptions in the 1-10-mW range, a low-power regime not significantly explored in prior designs. Such low power levels add to the challenge of link efficiency, because the overhead associated with switching losses in power amplifiers at the link input and with rectifiers at the link output significantly degrade link efficiency. We describe a novel integrated Class-E power amplifier design that uses a simple control strategy to minimize such losses. At 10-mW load power consumption, we measure overall link efficiencies of 74% and 54% at 1- and 10-mm coil separations, respectively, in good agreement with our theoretical predictions of the link's efficiency.

This power divider is implemented on a parallel-strip line, which is a balanced transmission line. By implementing the advantages and uniqueness of the parallel-strip line, the divider outperforms the conventional divider in terms of isolation bandwidths. A swap structure of the two lines of the parallel-strip line is employed in this design, which is critical for the isolation enhancements. A lumped-circuit model of the parallel-strip swap including all parasitic effects has been analyzed. An equal power divider with center frequency of 2 GHz was designed to demonstrate the idea. The experimental results show that the equal power divider has 96.5% -10-dB impedance bandwidth with more than 25-dB isolation and less than 0.7-dB insertion loss. In order to generalize the concept with an arbitrary power ratio, we also realize unequal power dividers with the same isolation characteristics. The impedance bandwidth of the proposed power divider will increase with the dividing ratio, which is opposite to the conventional Wilkinson power divider. Unequal dividers with dividing ratios of 1 : 2 and 1 : 12 are designed and measured.

Wang","Univ. de Los Andes, Merida; NA; NA","IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","","2007","1","3","383","395","In this paper, ultra-wideband (UWB) channel estimation based on the theory of compressive sensing (CS) is developed. The proposed approach relies on the fact that transmitting an ultra-short pulse through a multipath UWB channel leads to a received UWB signal that can be approximated by a linear combination of a few atoms from a pre-defined dictionary, yielding thus a sparse representation of the received UWB signal. The key in the proposed approach is in the design of a dictionary of parameterized waveforms (atoms) that closely matches the information-carrying pulseshape leading thus to higher energy compaction and sparse representation, and, therefore higher probability for CS reconstruction. Two approaches for UWB channel estimation are developed under a data-aided framework. In the first approach, the CS reconstruction capabilities are exploited to recover the composite pulse-multipath channel from a reduced set of random projections. This reconstructed signal is subsequently used as a referent template in a correlator-based detector. In the second approach, from a set of random projections of the received pilot signal, the Matching Pursuit algorithm is used to identify the strongest atoms in the projected signal that, in turn, are related to the strongest propagation paths that composite the multipath UWB channel. A Rake like receiver uses those atoms as templates for the bank of correlators in the detection stage. The bit error rate performances of the proposed approaches are analyzed and compared to that of traditional correlator-based detector. Extensive simulations show that for different propagation scenarios and UWB communication channels, detectors based on CS channel estimation outperform traditional correlator using just 1/3 of the sampling rate leading thus to a reduced use of analog-to-digital resources in the channel estimation stage.","1941-0484","","10.1109/JSTSP.2007.906657","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4336106","Channel estimation;compressive sensing;detection;ultra-wideband","Ultra wideband technology;Compressed sensing;Channel estimation;Detectors;Dictionaries;Signal processing;Matching pursuit algorithms;Correlators;Linear approximation;Compaction","channel estimation;correlators;error statistics;multipath channels;radio receivers;signal detection;signal reconstruction;ultra wideband communication;wireless channels","ultra-wideband compressed sensing;UWB channel estimation;pulse multipath UWB channel;parameterized waveforms;data-aided framework;random projections;signal reconstruction;correlator-based detector;Matching Pursuit algorithm;Rake like receiver;bit error rate;sampling rate","","186","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Federated avionics architectures make use of distributed avionics functions that are packaged as self-contained units (LRUs and LRMs). IMA architectures employ a high-integrity, partitioned environment that hosts multiple avionics functions of different criticalities on a shared computing platform. This provides for weight and power savings since computing resources can be used more efficiently. This paper establishes the benefits of transitioning to IMA. To aid in the planning process, the paper also identifies factors to consider before transitioning to IMA. The approach to resource management (computing, communication, and I/O) is identified as the fundamental architectural difference between federated and IMA systems. The paper describes how this difference changes the development process and benefits the systems integrator. This paper also addresses misconceptions about the resource management mechanisms that can occur during a transition to IMA and concludes that resources are not inherently constrained by IMA architectures. Guidance is provided for transitioning to both ""open"" and ""closed"" IMA architectures. Open IMA architectures utilize open interface standards that are available in the public domain. Closed IMA architectures utilize proprietary interfaces that can be customized. The analysis of these avionics architectures is based upon the authors' experience in developing platform computing systems at GE Aviation.

In the past decade, numerous algorithms have been proposed to perform this estimation. One commonly used assumption is the presence of pure pixels in the given image scene, which are detected to serve as endmembers. When such pixels are absent, the image is referred to as the highly mixed data, for which these algorithms at best can only return certain data points that are close to the real endmembers. To overcome this problem, we present a novel method without the pure-pixel assumption, referred to as the minimum volume constrained nonnegative matrix factorization (MVC-NMF), for unsupervised endmember extraction from highly mixed image data. Two important facts are exploited: First, the spectral data are nonnegative; second, the simplex volume determined by the endmembers is the minimum among all possible simplexes that circumscribe the data scatter space. The proposed method takes advantage of the fast convergence of NMF schemes, and at the same time eliminates the pure-pixel assumption.

After discussing several misconceptions and apparently insurmountable obstacles, we propose a general model which, under mild assumptions, will generate provably random bits with some tolerance to adversarial manipulation and running in the megabit-per-second range. A key idea throughout the paper is the fill rate, which measures the fraction of the time domain in which the analog output signal is arguably random. Our study shows that an exponential increase in the number of oscillators is required to obtain a constant factor improvement in the fill rate. Yet, we overcome this problem by introducing a postprocessing step which consists of an application of an appropriate resilient function. These allow the designer to extract random samples only from a signal with only moderate fill rate and, therefore, many fewer oscillators than in other designs. Last, we develop fault-attack models and we employ the properties of resilient functions to withstand such attacks. All of our analysis is based on rigorous methods, enabling us to develop a framework in which we accurately quantify the performance and the degree of resilience of the design","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2007.250627","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4016501","True (and pseudo) random number generators;resilient functions;cryptography.","","cryptography;digital arithmetic;fault tolerant computing;jitter;oscillators;random number generation","provably secure true random number generator;built-in tolerance;active attacks;sampling phase jitter;oscillator rings;postprocessing step;resilient function;fault-attack models;cryptography","","302","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A promising way to overcome this problem is to detect driver distraction and adapt in-vehicle systems accordingly to mitigate such distractions. To realize this strategy, this paper applied support vector machines (SVMs), which is a data mining method, to develop a real-time approach for detecting cognitive distraction using drivers' eye movements and driving performance data. Data were collected in a simulator experiment in which ten participants interacted with an IVIS while driving. The data were used to train and test both SVM and logistic regression models, and three different model characteristics were investigated: how distraction was defined, which data were input to the model, and how the input data were summarized. The results show that the SVM models were able to detect driver distraction with an average accuracy of 81.1%, outperforming more traditional logistic regression models. The best performing model (96.1% accuracy) resulted when distraction was defined using experimental conditions (i.e., IVIS drive or baseline drive), the input data were comprised of eye movement and driving measures, and these data were summarized over a 40-s window with 95% overlap of windows. These results demonstrate that eye movements and simple measures of driving performance can be used to detect driver distraction in real time.

This effect is accomplished by making the exoskeleton display active impedance properties. Active impedance control emphasizes control of the exoskeleton's dynamics and regulation of the transfer of energy between the exoskeleton and the user. Its goal is improving the dynamic response of the human limbs without sacrificing the user's control authority. The proposed method is an alternative to myoelectrical exoskeleton control, which is based on estimating muscle torques from electromyographical (EMG) activity. Implementation of an EMG-based controller is a complex task that involves modeling the user's musculoskeletal system and requires recalibration. In contrast, active impedance control is less dependent on estimation of the user's attempted motion, thereby avoiding conflicts resulting from inaccurate estimation. In this paper we also introduce a new form of human assist based on improving the kinematic response of the limbs. Reduction of average muscle torques is a common goal of research in human assist. However, less emphasis has been placed so far on improving the user's agility of motion. We aim to use active impedance control to attain such effects as increasing the user's average speed of motion, and improving their acceleration capabilities in order to compensate for perturbations from the environment.","1945-7901","978-1-4244-1319-5","10.1109/ICORR.2007.4428426","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4428426","Exoskeleton;lower limb;active impedance;assist","Exoskeletons;Impedance;Humans;Muscles;Motion control;Motion estimation;Displays;Torque control;Electromyography;Musculoskeletal system","artificial limbs;biomechanics;medical control systems;motion control","active-impedance control;lower-limb assistive exoskeleton;human limbs;muscle torques;perturbations","","68","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We present change distilling, a tree differencing algorithm for fine-grained source code change extraction. For that, we have improved the existing algorithm by Chawathe et al. for extracting changes in hierarchically structured data. Our algorithm extracts changes by finding both a match between the nodes of the compared two abstract syntax trees and a minimum edit script that can transform one tree into the other given the computed matching. As a result, we can identify fine-grained change types between program versions according to our taxonomy of source code changes. We evaluated our change distilling algorithm with a benchmark that we developed, which consists of 1,064 manually classified changes in 219 revisions of eight methods from three different open source projects. We achieved significant improvements in extracting types of source code changes: Our algorithm approximates the minimum edit script 45 percent better than the original change extraction approach by Chawathe et al. We are able to find all occurring changes and almost reach the minimum conforming edit script, that is, we reach a mean absolute percentage error of 34 percent, compared to the 79 percent reached by the original algorithm.

Generally, a force sensor is used for sensing the external force. It is well known that information of a force sensor has much noise. Furthermore, unstable state is also caused by the narrow bandwidth of force information by a force sensor. This paper shows that stable contact with the environment is difficult when a force sensor is used because of its soft mechanical structure and narrow bandwidth of force sensing. In order to solve the instability of force control, the disturbance observer is implemented instead of the force sensor. The disturbance observer can observe the external force without force sensors. When the disturbance observer is implemented in a robot, a force control system does not include a soft mechanism between a robot and the environment. Since a robot can detect the environmental information directly, a wide bandwidth of force sensing is attained. In this way, this paper solves the problems of force control by considering the force sensing method without changing the control architecture, and the ability of force control is improved.

In previous works related to power systems, only the two-point estimate method has been considered. In this paper, four different Hong's point estimate schemes are presented and tested on the probabilistic power flow problem.

Two capacitive coupling elements are placed at two perpendicular positions of a squared ring, whereas a pair of open-circuited stubs is formed in the symmetrical plane of these two excited ports similar to a dual-mode ring filter in shape. By stretching the paired stubs close to one-eighth of a wavelength, the first two even-order resonances move down to be quasi-equally located at two sides of the first odd-order resonance, thus forming a triple-resonance ring resonator. As interdigital coupled lines are installed at two ports instead of lumped capacitors, two extra resonances can be moved into passband, thereby making up a quintuple-resonance ring resonator. To provide an insight into their operating mechanism, these ring resonators are characterized in terms of transmission line theory. Afterwards, various wideband microstrip ring resonator bandpass filters with one or two asymmetric ring resonators are optimally designed and fabricated. Simulated results are confirmed via experiment, showing good wideband filtering performance with widened/deepened upper stopband and sharpened rejection skirts outside the wide passband.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2007.906510","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4339629","Microstrip ring resonator;multiple resonant modes;parallel-coupled line;wideband bandpass filter","Wideband;Microstrip filters;Microstrip resonators;Optical ring resonators;Band pass filters;Resonance;Resonator filters;Passband;Shape;Couplings","band-pass filters;circuit resonance;microstrip filters;microstrip resonators","wideband microstrip ring resonator bandpass filters;multiple resonances;capacitive coupling;open-circuited stubs;dual-mode ring filter;interdigital coupled lines;lumped capacitors;transmission line theory","","109","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A particularly suitable application of the network coding arises for the two-way relay channels, where two nodes communicate with each other assisted by using a third, relay node. Such a scenario enables application of physical network coding, where the network coding is either done (a) jointly with the channel coding or (b) through physical combining of the communication flows over the multiple access channel. In this paper we first group the existing schemes for physical network coding into two generic schemes, termed 3-step and 2-step scheme, respectively. We investigate the conditions for maximization of the two-way rate for each individual scheme: (1) the decode-and-forward (DF) 3-step schemes (2) three different schemes with two steps: amplify-and-forward (AF), JDF and denoise-and-forward (DNF).

The de facto modeling method to analyze CHC is based on substrate current Isub, which becomes increasingly problematic with technology scaling as various leakage components dominate Isub. In this paper, we present a unified approach that directly predicts the change of key transistor parameters under various process and design conditions for both NBTI and CHC effects. Using the general reaction-diffusion model and the concept of surface potential, the proposed method continuously captures the performance degradation across subthreshold and strong inversion regions. Models are comprehensively verified with an industrial 65-nm technology. By benchmarking the prediction of circuit performance degradation with the measured ring oscillator data and simulations of an amplifier, we demonstrate that the proposed method very well predicts the degradation. For 65-nm technology, NBTI is the dominant reliability concern, and the impact of CHC on circuit performance is relatively small.","1558-2574","","10.1109/TDMR.2007.910130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359941","Channel hot carrier (CHC);circuit;interface traps;negative bias temperature instability (NBTI);performance;reaction–diffusion (R–D) model;simulation","CMOS technology;Semiconductor device modeling;Circuit simulation;Niobium compounds;Titanium compounds;Degradation;Circuit optimization;Negative bias temperature instability;Hot carriers;Process design","MOSFET;nanoelectronics;semiconductor device models;semiconductor device reliability;thermal stability","CMOS technology;integrated circuit reliability;negative bias temperature instability;channel hot carrier;nanoscale transistors;de facto modeling method;leakage components;reaction-diffusion model;surface potential;circuit performance degradation;ring oscillator;size 65 nm","","220","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Dithering Skip Modulation, Width and Dead Time Controllers in Highly Efficient DC-DC Converters for System-On-Chip Applications","H. Huang; K. Chen; S. Kuo","Nat. Taiwan Univ., Taipei; NA; NA","IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","","2007","42","11","2451","2465","This paper proposes temperature-independent load sensor (LS), optimum width controller (OWC), optimum dead-time controller (ODC), and tri-mode operation to achieve high efficiency over an ultra-wide-load range. Higher power efficiency and wider loading current range require rethinking the control method for DC-DC converters. Therefore, a highly efficient tri-mode DC-DC converter is invented in this paper for system-on-chip (SoC) applications, which is switched to sleeping mode at very light load condition or to high-speed mode at heavy load condition. The efficiency improvement is upgraded by inserting new proposed dithering skip modulation (DSM) between conventional pulse-width modulation (PWM) and pulse-frequency modulation (PFM). In other words, an efficiency-improving DSM operation raises the efficiency drop because of transition from PWM to PFM. Importantly, DSM mode can dynamically skip the number of gate driving pulses, which is inverse proportional to load current. Simplistically and qualitatively stated, the novel load sensor automatically selects optimum modulation method and power MOSFET width to achieve high efficiency over a wide load range. Moreover, optimum power MOSFET turn-on and turn-off delays in synchronous rectifiers and reduced ground bounce can save much switching loss by current-mode dead-time controller. Experimental results show the tri-mode operation can have high efficiency about 90% over a wide load current range from 3 to 500 mA. Owing to the effective mitigation of the switching loss contributed by optimum power MOSFET width and reduction of conduction loss contributed by optimum dead-times, the novel width and dead-time controllers achieve high efficiency about 95% at heavy load condition and maintain the highly efficient performance to very light load current about 0.1 mA.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2007.907175","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4362095","DC-DC converter;delay-line chain;dithering skip modulation;ground bounce;load sensing circuit;optimum dead-time;width controller","Control systems;DC-DC power converters;System-on-a-chip;Pulse width modulation;Space vector pulse width modulation;MOSFET circuits;Power MOSFET;Temperature control;Switching loss;Temperature sensors","DC-DC power convertors;modulation;power MOSFET;rectifiers;system-on-chip","dithering skip modulation;system-on-chip applications;optimum width controller;temperature-independent load sensor;optimum dead-time controller;tri-mode DC-DC converter;SoC;DSM;gate driving pulses;power MOSFET;synchronous rectifiers;switching loss;current-mode dead-time controller;tri-mode operation","","130","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Providing more of the increased requirement for reserves from standing reserve sources could increase system operation efficiency, enhance wind power absorption, achieve fuel cost savings, and reduce CO2 emissions. Generally, storage-based standing reserve's value is driven by the amount of installed wind and by generation system flexibility. Benefits are more significant in systems with low generation flexibility and with large installed wind capacity. Storage is uniquely able to stock up generated excesses during high-wind/low-demand periods, and subsequently discharge this energy as needed.

The relationship between following distance and velocity mapped into a two-dimensional space is modeled for each driver with an optimal velocity model approximated by a nonlinear function or with a statistical method of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Pedal operation patterns are also modeled with GMMs that represent the distributions of raw pedal operation signals or spectral features extracted through spectral analysis of the raw pedal operation signals. The driver models are evaluated in driver identification experiments using driving signals collected in a driving simulator and in a real vehicle. Experimental results show that the driver model based on the spectral features of pedal operation signals efficiently models driver individual differences and achieves an identification rate of 76.8% for a field test with 276 drivers, resulting in a relative error reduction of 55% over driver models that use raw pedal operation signals without spectral analysis","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2006.888405","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4142931","Car-following;driver identification;driver modeling;driving behavior;Gaussian mixture model (GMM);pedal operation;spectral analysis","Vehicle driving;Wheels;Spectral analysis;Signal processing;Driver circuits;Vehicle safety;Intelligent transportation systems;Automatic control;Predictive models;Intelligent systems","braking;Gaussian processes;human factors;identification;nonlinear functions;road safety;road vehicles;spectral analysis;user modelling","driver modeling;driving behavior;driver identification;vehicle safety;car-following pattern;pedal operation patterns;optimal velocity model;nonlinear function;statistical method;Gaussian mixture model;spectral analysis;raw pedal operation","","144","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The design challenge is compounded further by the need to take user traffic demands into consideration. This paper proposes a centralized utility maximization framework for such a network. We show that for a cellular system employing orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA), the optimization of physical-layer transmission strategies can be done efficiently by introducing a set of pricing variables as weighting factors. The proposed solution incorporates both user traffic demands and the physical channel realizations in a cross-layer design that not only allocates power and bandwidth optimally for each user, but also selects the best relay node and best relay strategy (i.e. decode-and-forward vs. amplify-and-forward) for each source-destination pair","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2007.070209","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4107952","","Relays;Resource management;Land mobile radio cellular systems;Bandwidth;Telecommunication traffic;Cellular networks;Base stations;Wireless networks;Radio spectrum management;Power system relaying","bandwidth allocation;cellular radio;fading channels;frequency division multiple access;OFDM modulation;resource allocation;telecommunication traffic","optimization;relay strategy;resource allocation;wireless cooperative cellular network;frequency-selective slow-fading environment;bandwidth allocation;user traffic;centralized utility maximization framework;orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access;OFDMA;physical channel realization;cross-layer design","","380","","42","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To record movements of the upper extremities, a sensing units which included miniature gyroscopes, has been fixed to each of the forearms. An algorithm to detect and quantify tremor and another algorithm to quantify bradykinesia have been proposed and validated. Two clinical studies have been performed. In the first study, 10 PD patients and 10 control subjects participated in a 45-min protocol of 17 typical daily activities. The algorithm for tremor detection showed an overall sensitivity of 99.5% and a specificity of 94.2% in comparison to a video reference. The estimated tremor amplitude showed a high correlation to the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) tremor subscore (e.g., r=0.87, p<0.001 for the roll axis). There was a high and significant correlation between the estimated bradykinesia related parameters estimated for the whole period of measurement and respective UPDRS subscore (e.g., r=-0.83, p<0.001 for the roll axis). In the second study, movements of upper extremities of 11 PD patients were recorded for periods of 3-5 hr. The patients were moving freely during the measurements. The effects of selection of window size used to calculate tremor and bradykinesia related parameters on the correlation between UPDRS and these parameters were studied. By selecting a window similar to the period of the first study, similar correlations were obtained. Moreover, one of the bradykinesia related parameters showed significant correlation (r=-0.74, p<0.01) to UPDRS with window sizes as short as 5 min.

A constant azimuthal profile spacing (111.246deg), based on the Golden Ratio, is investigated as optimal for image reconstruction from an arbitrary number of profiles in radial MRI. The profile order is evaluated and compared with a uniform profile distribution in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and artifact level. The favorable characteristics of such a profile order are exemplified in two applications on healthy volunteers. First, an advanced sliding window reconstruction scheme is applied to dynamic cardiac imaging, with a reconstruction window that can be flexibly adjusted according to the extent of cardiac motion that is acceptable. Second, a contrast-enhancing k-space filter is presented that permits reconstructing an arbitrary number of images at arbitrary time points from one raw data set. The filter was utilized to depict the T1-relaxation in the brain after a single inversion prepulse. While a uniform profile distribution with a constant angle increment is optimal for a fixed and predetermined number of profiles, a profile distribution based on the Golden Ratio proved to be an appropriate solution for an arbitrary number of profiles","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2006.885337","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4039540","Projection reconstruction;radial signal-to-noise ratio (MRI);real-time imaging;time-resolved imaging","Magnetic resonance imaging;Image reconstruction;Spatial resolution;Filters;Biomedical imaging;Europe;Kinetic theory;Image resolution;Signal to noise ratio;Biomedical engineering","biomedical MRI;brain;cardiology;image motion analysis;image reconstruction;medical image processing","optimal radial profile order;golden ratio;time-resolved MRI;dynamic magnetic resonance imaging;motion kinetics;contrast variability;image reconstruction;advanced sliding window reconstruction;dynamic cardiac imaging;contrast-enhancing k-space filter;T1-relaxation;brain","Algorithms;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","363","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The resulting FeRAM-based tag has a nominally identical communication range for both read and write operations, which is indispensable for data write applications. The evaluated tag communication range with a folded dipole antenna is from 0 m to 4.3 m, at the 953-MHz carrier frequency with 4-W transmitting Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) from a reader/writer. The developed tag IC features two circuit blocks to maximize the communication range in 0.35-mum CMOS/FeRAM technology. First is a CMOS-only full-wave rectifier, which can improve the measured efficiency by up to 36.6% by reducing the input parasitic capacitances and optimization of multiplier structure. This efficiency is more than twice that of previously-published results. Second is a low-voltage current-mode ASK demodulator to accommodate a low-breakdown voltage of FeRAM, which converts the ASK power modulation into a linearly modulated current over an incoming power range of 27 dB, corresponding to the entire communication range. The developed demodulator can thus resolve the primary design tradeoff issue between device protection and detection sensitivity in the conventional voltage-mode demodulator","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2006.886523","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4039597","CMOS-only full-wave rectifier;current-mode demodulator;electromagnetic radiative interference;ferroelectric random access memories;identical read/write communication;UHF radio frequency identification","Radio frequency;Radiofrequency identification;CMOS integrated circuits;UHF integrated circuits;Radiofrequency integrated circuits;Random access memory;Ferroelectric films;Nonvolatile memory;CMOS technology;Demodulation","amplitude shift keying;CMOS integrated circuits;demodulators;ferroelectric storage;radiofrequency identification;random-access storage;rectifying circuits","passive UHF RF identification CMOS tag IC;ferroelectric RAM;rewritable applications;read-and-write transaction time;FeRAM-based tag;folded dipole antenna;effective isotropic radiated power;CMOS-only full-wave rectifier;parasitic capacitances;multiplier structure;low-voltage current-mode ASK demodulator;ASK power modulation;voltage-mode demodulator;electromagnetic radiative interference;ferroelectric random access memories;953 MHz;2 kBytes;4 W;0.35 micron","","189","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In contrast to traditional control and estimation problems, here the observation and control packets may be lost or delayed. The unreliability of the underlying communication network is modeled stochastically by assigning probabilities to the successful transmission of packets. This requires a novel theory which generalizes classical control/estimation paradigms. The paper offers the foundations of such a novel theory. The central contribution is to characterize the impact of the network reliability on the performance of the feedback loop. Specifically, it is shown that for network protocols where successful transmissions of packets is acknowledged at the receiver (e.g., TCP-like protocols), there exists a critical threshold of network reliability (i.e., critical probabilities for the successful delivery of packets), below which the optimal controller fails to stabilize the system. Further, for these protocols, the separation principle holds and the optimal LQG controller is a linear function of the estimated state. In stark contrast, it is shown that when there is no acknowledgement of successful delivery of control packets (e.g., UDP-like protocols), the LQG optimal controller is in general nonlinear. Consequently, the separation principle does not hold in this circumstance","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2006.887306","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4118476","LQG control;networked control systems;optimal estimation;packet drop;separation principle;stability;TCP;UDP","Communication system control;Protocols;Optimal control;Delay estimation;Actuators;Communication networks;Telecommunication network reliability;Feedback loop;Control systems;State estimation","control systems;optimal control","lossy networks;sensor signals;actuator signals;communication network;network reliability;feedback loop;optimal controller;optimal estimation;packet drop;separation principle","","835","","45","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The lookup-table-based feedback input can remove the bandwidth limitation of the feedback circuit related to the loop delay, and suppress feedback oscillation by accurate digital control of the feedback signal. Moreover, the predistortion (PD) signal can be extracted very efficiently. By combining the feedback linearization and DPD linearization techniques, the performance of the predistorter is enhanced significantly compared to the conventional DPD. To clearly visualize the characteristics of digital FBPD (DFBPD), we have compared it to the conventional DPD based on the recursive least square algorithm using Matlab simulation. The results clearly show that the new method is a good linearization algorithm, better than a conventional DPD. For the demonstration, a Doherty power amplifier with 180-W peak envelope power is linearized using the proposed DFBPD.

A notable feature of the time series is the presence of both an in-traweek and an intraday seasonal cycle. The forecasting methods considered in the study include: ARIMA modeling, periodic AR modeling, an extension for double seasonality of Holt-Winters exponential smoothing, a recently proposed alternative exponential smoothing formulation, and a method based on the principal component analysis (PCA) of the daily demand profiles. Our results show a similar ranking of methods across the 10 load series. The results were disappointing for the new alternative exponential smoothing method and for the periodic AR model.

The basic idea for FMCW-radars is to generate a linear frequency ramp as transmit signal. The difference frequency between the transmitted and received signal is determined after downconversion. In order to detect range and velocity together, the information, extracted from one frequency ramp, is not enough, because it is ambiguous. Several subsequent ramps have to be generated to remove the ambiguity between the frequency portion produced by range and the Doppler frequency. In this paper two methods are presented to perform this basic signal processing step. The two methods have the Fast Fourier Transform as basic calculation step in common, but the number of FFTs and their length are different. The requirements on bandwidth for the IF-Hardware and A/D-Converters are also determined by the algorithm for Range-Doppler-Detection. The CFAR (constant false alarm rate)-algorithm for target detection must also be adapted to the chosen method. Both methods have been verified with a 24 GHz radar prototype. The radar-frontend has been built with a newly developed SiGe-radar-chipset on inflneon's B7HF200-process with a transition frequency of 200 GHz.","","978-2-87487-001-9","10.1109/EUMC.2007.4405477","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4405477","","Radar detection;Automotive engineering;Doppler radar;Frequency;Signal processing algorithms;Signal generators;Data mining;Fast Fourier transforms;Flexible printed circuits;Bandwidth","analogue-digital conversion;CW radar;Doppler radar;fast Fourier transforms;FM radar;radar detection;radar signal processing;road vehicle radar","range Doppler detection;automotive FMCW radar system;linear frequency ramp;signal processing;Fast Fourier Transform;FFT;IF-Hardware;A/D converters;constant false alarm rate algorithm;target detection;frequency 24 GHz","","16","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed metric, the visual signal-to-noise ratio (VSNR), operates via a two-stage approach. In the first stage, contrast thresholds for detection of distortions in the presence of natural images are computed via wavelet-based models of visual masking and visual summation in order to determine whether the distortions in the distorted image are visible. If the distortions are below the threshold of detection, the distorted image is deemed to be of perfect visual fidelity (VSNR = infin)and no further analysis is required. If the distortions are suprathreshold, a second stage is applied which operates based on the low-level visual property of perceived contrast, and the mid-level visual property of global precedence. These two properties are modeled as Euclidean distances in distortion-contrast space of a multiscale wavelet decomposition, and VSNR is computed based on a simple linear sum of these distances. The proposed VSNR metric is generally competitive with current metrics of visual fidelity; it is efficient both in terms of its low computational complexity and in terms of its low memory requirements; and it operates based on physical luminances and visual angle (rather than on digital pixel values and pixel-based dimensions) to accommodate different viewing conditions.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2007.901820","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4286985","Contrast;distortion;human visual system (HVS);image fidelity;image quality;noise;visual fidelity;wavelet","Signal to noise ratio;Humans;Visual system;PSNR;Digital images;Image coding;Psychology;Object detection;Distortion measurement;Image analysis","image processing;natural scenes;visual perception;wavelet transforms","VSNR;wavelet-based visual signal-to-noise ratio;natural images;visual fidelity;near-threshold;suprathreshold properties;human vision;wavelet-based models;visual masking;visual summation;Euclidean distances;multiscale wavelet decomposition","Algorithms;Biomimetics;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Visual Perception","712","","83","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, the power flow management for a new hybrid cascaded multilevel inverter is present. In this new hybrid inverter, the H-bridge inverter (main inverter) and the 3-level diode clamped inverter (conditioning inverter) are connected together to drive motor, but only the main inverter needs DC voltage source. The conditioning inverter just uses non-supplied ultra capacitors as its power source. Thanks to the proposed power flow management, the conditioning inverter can be used to store and reuse the braking energy of motor load. Therefore, compared with conventional H- bridge inverter, considerable energy efficiency improvement is achieved. Additionally, when the motor is at a steady speed, the conditioning inverter can provide the reactive power to the motor and improve the system dynamic performance.

Automatic web vulnerability scanners can help to locate these vulnerabilities and are popular tools among developers of web applications. Their purpose is to stress the application from the attacker's point of view by issuing a huge amount of interaction within it. Two of the most widely spread and dangerous vulnerabilities in web applications are SQL injection and cross site scripting (XSS), because of the damage they may cause to the victim business. Trusting the results of web vulnerability scanning tools is of utmost importance. Without a clear idea on the coverage and false positive rate of these tools, it is difficult to judge the relevance of the results they provide. Furthermore, it is difficult, if not impossible, to compare key figures of merit of web vulnerability scanners. In this paper we propose a method to evaluate and benchmark automatic web vulnerability scanners using software fault injection techniques. The most common types of software faults are injected in the web application code which is then checked by the scanners. The results are compared by analyzing coverage of vulnerability detection and false positives. Three leading commercial scanning tools are evaluated and the results show that in general the coverage is low and the percentage of false positives is very high.","","0-7695-3054-0","10.1109/PRDC.2007.55","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4459684","","Testing;Application software;Data security;Databases;Time factors;Intrusion detection;Web server;Hardware;Computer bugs;Stress","Internet;program testing;security of data;software fault tolerance;SQL","Web vulnerability scanning tool;SQL injection;XSS attack;cross site scripting;software fault injection technique","","71","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The battery charger employs a new control loop that relaxes comparator resolution requirements, provides simultaneous operation of constant-current and constant-voltage loops, and eliminates the external current sense resistor from the charging path. The accuracy of the end-of-charge (EOC) detection is primarily determined by the voltage drop across matched resistors and current-sources and the offset voltage of the sense comparator. Experimental results in 0.6-mum 3M-2P CMOS technology indicate that plusmn1.3% (or plusmn20 muA) EOC accuracy can be obtained under worst case conditions for a comparator offset voltage of plusmn5 mV. The circuit measures roughly 1.74 mm2 and dissipates 8.4 mW in the charging phase while delivering a load current of 1.5 mA at 4.1 V (or 6.15 mW) for an efficiency of 73%.","1558-3791","","10.1109/TCSII.2007.901613","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4349228","Battery charger;medical implants;rechargeable lithium (Li)-ion battery;wireless power interface","Batteries;Implants;Circuits;Resistors;CMOS technology;Lithium;Schottky barriers;Schottky diodes;Low voltage;Signal resolution","battery charge measurement;battery chargers;CMOS analogue integrated circuits;lithium;power integrated circuits;prosthetic power supplies;radiofrequency integrated circuits;Schottky diodes;secondary cells","voltage 4.1 V;current 1.5 mA;size 0.6 mum;Li - Interface;CMOS technology;sense comparator;offset voltage determination;current-sources;matched resistors;voltage drop determination;end-of-charge detection;constant-voltage loops;constant-current loops;battery charger control loop;DC signal extraction;integrated Schottky barrier rectifying diodes;miniature lithium ion rechargeable batteries;integrated wirelessly powered battery charging circuit;rechargeable battery operated medical implants;wireless power interface","","139","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Design and Experiment on Differentially-Driven Microstrip Antennas","Y. P. Zhang","Nanyang Technol. Univ., Singapore","IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","","2007","55","10","2701","2708","Design and experiment is given of differentially-driven microstrip antennas. First, the design formulas to determine the patch dimensions and the location of the feed point for single-ended microstrip antennas are examined to design differentially-driven microstrip antennas. It is found that the patch length can still be designed using the formulas for the required resonant frequency but the patch width calculated by the formula usually needs to be widen to ensure the excitation of the fundamental mode using the probe feeds. The condition that links the patch width, the locations of the probe feeds, and the excitation of the fundamental mode is given. Second, the wideband techniques for single-ended microstrip antennas are evaluated for differentially-driven microstrip antennas. A novel H-slot is proposed for differentially-driven microstrip antennas to improve impedance bandwidth. Third, the effects of imperfect differential signal conditions on the performance of differentially-driven microstrip antennas are investigated for the first time. It is found that they only degrade the polarization purity in the -plane with an increased radiation of cross-polarization. Finally, both differentially-driven and single-ended microstrip antennas were fabricated and measured. It is shown that the simulated and measured results are in acceptable agreement. More importantly, it is also shown that the differentially-driven microstrip antenna has wider impedance bandwidth of measured 4.1% and simulated 3.9% and higher gain of measured 4.2 dBi and simulated 3.7 dBi as compared with those of measured 1.9% and simulated 1.3% and gain of measured 1.2 dBi and simulated 1.2 dBi of the single-ended microstrip antenna.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2007.905832","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4339597","Cavity model;input impedance;microstrip patch antenna;radiation pattern","Microstrip antennas;Antenna measurements;Impedance measurement;Gain measurement;Broadband antennas;Antenna feeds;Probes;Bandwidth;Resonant frequency;Degradation","antenna radiation patterns;broadband antennas;microstrip antennas","differentially-driven microstrip antennas;design formulas;patch dimensions;wideband techniques;single-ended microstrip antennas;impedance bandwidth;cross-polarization radiation;radiation pattern","","56","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method is applied to experimental RF data from a heart phantom, in which we show increased resolution and improved definition of the ventricular walls. A potential weakness of adaptive beamformers is sensitivity to errors in the assumed wavefield parameters. We look at two ways to increase robustness of the proposed method; spatial smoothing and diagonal loading. We show that both are controlled by a single parameter that can move the performance from that of a MV beamformer to that of a DAS beamformer.

To improve the calculated position in real implementations, WCL uses weights to attract the estimated position to close reference points provided that coarse distances are available.

As a cost-effective solution, multihop communication is becoming more and more important to WiMAX systems. To successfully deploy multihop WiMAX networks, security is one of the major challenges that must be addressed. Another crucial issue is how to support different services and applications in WiMAX networks. Since WiMAX is a relatively new standard, very little work has been presented in the literature. In this article we propose a secure and service-oriented network control framework for WiMAX networks. In the design of this framework we consider both the security requirements of the communications and the requirements of potential WiMAX applications that have not been fully addressed previously in the network layer design. The proposed framework consists of two basic components: a service-aware control framework and a unified routing scheme. Besides the design of the framework, we further study a number of key enabling technologies that are important to a practical WiMAX network. Our study can provide a guideline for the design of a more secure and practical WiMAX network","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2007.358859","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4197725","","WiMAX;Communication system security;Spread spectrum communication;Portable media players;Communication system control;Routing;Guidelines;Relays;Web and internet services;Network topology","broadband networks;radio access networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;WiMax","service-oriented network control framework;WiMAX networks;worldwide interoperability for microwave access;wireless communication system;broadband access;multihop WiMAX networks;security;unified routing scheme","","68","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Although many architectures are possible for IPTV video distribution, several mesh-pull P2P architectures have been successfully deployed on the Internet. In order to gain insights into mesh-pull P2P IPTV systems and the traffic loads they place on ISPs, we have undertaken an in-depth measurement study of one of the most popular IPTV systems, namely, PPLive. We have developed a dedicated PPLive crawler, which enables us to study the global characteristics of the mesh-pull PPLive system. We have also collected extensive packet traces for various different measurement scenarios, including both campus access networks and residential access networks. The measurement results obtained through these platforms bring important insights into P2P IPTV systems. Specifically, our results show the following. 1) P2P IPTV users have the similar viewing behaviors as regular TV users. 2) During its session, a peer exchanges video data dynamically with a large number of peers. 3) A small set of super peers act as video proxy and contribute significantly to video data uploading. 4) Users in the measured P2P IPTV system still suffer from long start-up delays and playback lags, ranging from several seconds to a couple of minutes.

When implemented in highly scaled digital CMOS processes, the proposed architecture is more advantageous over conventional charge-pump-based phase-locked loops (PLLs) since it exploits signal processing capabilities of digital circuits and avoids relying on the fine voltage resolution of analog circuits. In this brief, we present novel techniques used in the all-digital PLL to achieve an ultra-fast frequency acquisition of <50 mus while maintaining excellent phase noise and spurious performance during transmission and reception.

However, biometrics raises several privacy concerns. A biometric is permanently associated with a user and cannot be changed. Hence, if a biometric identifier is compromised, it is lost forever and possibly for every application where the biometric is used. Moreover, if the same biometric is used in multiple applications, a user can potentially be tracked from one application to the next by cross-matching biometric databases. In this paper, we demonstrate several methods to generate multiple cancelable identifiers from fingerprint images to overcome these problems. In essence, a user can be given as many biometric identifiers as needed by issuing a new transformation ""key"". The identifiers can be cancelled and replaced when compromised. We empirically compare the performance of several algorithms such as Cartesian, polar, and surface folding transformations of the minutiae positions. It is demonstrated through multiple experiments that we can achieve revocability and prevent cross-matching of biometric databases. It is also shown that the transforms are noninvertible by demonstrating that it is computationally as hard to recover the original biometric identifier from a transformed version as by randomly guessing.

Negative bias to the bulk or positive bias to the drain of the MOSFET devices with floating bulk is used to reduce effects of the parasitic diodes, leading to enhanced linearity and power handling for the switch.

The battery powered RFID IC can also work as a passive RFID tag without a battery or when the battery has died (i.e., voltage has dropped below 1.3 V); this novel dual passive and battery operation allays one of the major drawbacks of currently available active tags, namely that the tag cannot be used once the battery has died. When powered by a battery, the current consumption is 700 nA at 1.5 V (400 nA if internal signals are not brought out on test pads). This ultra-low-power consumption permits the use of a very small capacity battery of 100 mA-hr for lifetimes exceeding ten years; as a result a battery tag that is very close to a passive tag both in form factor and cost is made possible. The chip is built on a 1-mum digital CMOS process with dual poly layers, EEPROM and Schottky diodes. The RF threshold power at 2.45 GHz is -19 dBm which is the lowest ever reported threshold power for RFID tags and has a range exceeding 3.5 m under FCC unlicensed operation at the 2.4-GHz microwave band. The low threshold is achieved with architectural choices and low-power circuit design techniques. At 915 MHz, based on the experimentally measured tag impedance (92-j837) and the threshold spec of the tag (200 mV), the theoretical minimum range is 24 m. The tag initially is in a ""low-power"" mode to conserve power and when issued the appropriate command, it operates in ""full-power"" mode. The chip has on-chip voltage regulators, clock and data recovery circuits, EEPROM and a digital state machine that implements the ISO 18000-4 B protocol in the ""full-power"" mode. We provide detailed explanation of the clock recovery circuits and the implementation of the binary sort algorithm, which includes a pseudorandom number generator.

This approach introduces a two-phase conduction mode as opposed to the conventional three-phase DTC drives. In this control scheme, only two phases conduct at any instant of time. Unlike conventional six-step PWM current control, by properly selecting the inverter voltage space vectors of the two-phase conduction mode from a simple look-up table at a predefined sampling time, the desired quasi-square wave current is obtained. Therefore, a much faster torque response is achieved compared to conventional PWM current control. In this paper, it is also shown that in the constant torque region under the two-phase conduction DTC scheme, the amplitude of the stator flux linkage cannot easily be controlled due to the sharp changes and the curved shape of the flux vector between two consecutive commutation points in the stator flux linkage locus. Furthermore, to eliminate the low- frequency torque oscillations caused by the non-ideal trapezoidal shape of the actual back-EMF waveform of the BLDC motor, a pre-stored back-EMF versus position look-up table is designed. As a result, it is possible to achieve DTC of a BLDC motor drive with faster torque response due to the fact that the voltage space vectors are directly controlled while the stator flux linkage amplitude is deliberately kept almost constant by ignoring the flux control in the constant torque region. Since the flux control along with PWM generation is removed, fewer algorithms are required for the proposed control scheme. A theoretical concept is developed and the validity and effectiveness of the proposed DTC scheme are verified through the simulations and experimental results.","","1-4244-0742-7","10.1109/IEMDC.2007.383571","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4270633","Direct torque control;brushless dc motor drives;non-sinusoidal back-EMF;two-phase conduction;fast torque response;low-frequency torque ripples","Torque control;Brushless DC motors;Pulse width modulation;Stators;Couplings;Pulse width modulation inverters;Current control;Table lookup;Shape control;Voltage control","brushless DC motors;DC motor drives;table lookup;torque control","direct torque control;brushless DC motor;BLDC;nonsinusoidal back-EMF;two-phase conduction mode;look-up table;quasi-square wave current;stator flux linkage amplitude","","39","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed models, derived in terms of equivalent circuits, represent an extension of the models presented in a recent publication. In particular, the extended models take into account the presence of a dielectric substrate hosting the metallic inclusions and the losses due to the finite conductivity of the conductors and the finite resistivity of the dielectrics. Exploiting these circuit models, it is possible to accurately predict not only the resonant frequency of the individual inclusions, but also their quality factor and the relative permeability of metamaterial samples made by given arrangements of such inclusions. Finally, the three models have been tested against full-wave simulations and measurements, showing a good accuracy.

However, the resonance of the LCL filter can be also excited in a controlled way in order to individuate the resonance frequency in the spectrum (using for example the fast Fourier transform). This paper proposes to use a controlled excitation in measuring the grid impedance, since this one influences also the resonance frequency. This paper will address some possible limits, some solutions, and some implementation issues (e.g., how to obtain a controlled resonance in the filter without damaging the system) in order to use the resonant peak for grid impedance detection.

These equations are Euler-Lagrange equations of a cost functional which is an increasing function of the absolute value of the fractional derivative of the image intensity function, so the proposed equations can be seen as generalizations of second-order and fourth-order anisotropic diffusion equations. We use the discrete Fourier transform to implement the numerical algorithm and give an iterative scheme in the frequency domain. It is one important aspect of the algorithm that it considers the input image as a periodic image. To overcome this problem, we use a folded algorithm by extending the image symmetrically about its borders. Finally, we list various numerical results on denoising real images.

While this was at first motivated by the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in perovskite Cu oxides, this technological breakthrough was soon applied to other transition-metal oxides and, notably, mixed-valence manganites. The discovery of colossal magnetoresistance in manganite films triggered intense research activity on these materials, but the first notable impact of magnetic oxides in the field of spintronics was the use of such manganites as electrodes in magnetic tunnel junctions, yielding tunnel magnetoresistance ratios that are one order of magnitude larger than what had been obtained with transition-metal electrodes. Since then, research on oxide spintronics has been intense, with the latest developments focused on diluted magnetic oxides and, more recently, on multiferroics. In this paper, the most important results on oxide spintronics was reviewed, emphasizing materials physics as well as spin-dependent transport phenomena, and finally give some perspectives on how the flurry of new magnetic oxides could be useful for next-generation spintronics devices","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2007.894366","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4160091","Ferromagnets;multiferroics;oxides;spintronics;tunneling","","ferromagnetic materials;magnetoelectronics;multiferroics;thin films","oxide spintronics;oxide thin films;oxide heterostructures;diluted magnetic oxides;materials physics;spin-dependent transport phenomena;spintronics devices;ferromagnets;multiferroics","","265","","333","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We found that one-third of the study respondents use agile methodologies to varying degrees, and most view it favorably due to improved communication between team members, quick releases and the increased flexibility of agile designs. The scrum variant of agile methodologies is by far the most popular at Microsoft.

"Security of Mobile Communications","N. Boudriga","Prof., University of Carthage, Tunisia","2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","","2007","","","li","lii","Mobile communications offer wireless connectivity that enables mobility and computing in many different communication environments. The huge demands from social markets are driving the growing development of mobile communications more rapidly than ever before. Consequently, a large set of new advanced techniques have emerged brought up by a larger bandwidth, more powerful processing capability, and advances in computing technology. Many new services are provided, or will be provided to potential users, and delivered with high level quality by usage of GSM, 3G networks and wireless mesh networks in public, home, and corporate scenarios. The exceptional growth in mobile and wireless communications gives rise to serious problems of security at the level of the subscriber, network operator, and service provider. The causes of such rise, typically due to the fragility of the wireless link nature, the mobility features, and the variety of the provided services, can be classified into the following six categories: a) the physical weaknesses and limitations of mobile and communications; b) the architecture limitations; c) the complexity of services; d) the user requirements; e) the contents of provided services; and f) the evolution of hacking techniques. Many studies have addressed carefully the mobile subscriber authentication, radio-path encryption, and secure mobility, but the so-called ""security of mobile communications"" does no involve only these relative independent domains. It indeed needs a more systematic approach to build up a framework layout capable of allowing: 1) the risk analysis of threats and vulnerabilities of a mobile communication system; 2) the assessment of a mobile communication system in terms of provided QoS, roaming capabilities, and security; and 3) the protection of a service provided via mobile communication systems. The major goals of this tutorial consist in five issues: 1) analyzing and discussing the security proposals made available by the mobile cellular and ad-hoc communications systems; 2) discussing the security attacks and hacking techniques; 3) discussing security policies and security practices to help better addressing the security problem; 4) discussing the role of the network operator, the service provider, and customer in securing mobile communications; and 5) analyzing the promises, requirements, and limits of service provision in terms of security needs.","","978-1-4244-1235-8","10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728237","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4728237","","Mobile communication;Communication system security;Wireless communication;Computer crime;Bandwidth;GSM;Wireless mesh networks;Authentication;Cryptography;Risk analysis","3G mobile communication;ad hoc networks;cellular radio;cryptography;message authentication;telecommunication security","mobile communication security;social market demand;computing technology;GSM;3G networks;wireless mesh networks;wireless communications;subscriber security;network operator;mobile physical weaknesses;architecture limitations;complexity-of services;user requirements;hacking techniques;mobile subscriber authentication;radio-path encryption;threat risk analysis;QoS;roaming capabilities;mobile cellular communication;ad-hoc communication system;service provider","","2","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The performance results are obtained from a detailed UTRA LTE uplink link level simulator supporting OFDMA and SC-FDMA schemes. The basic transmission scheme for uplink direction is based on single-carrier transmission in the form of DFT spread OFDM with an MMSE receiver. Two antenna configurations, SISO and 1times2 SIMO are considered in the analysis of spectral efficiency in addition to adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) and L1-HARQ.

As a result of recent technological advances it is reasonable to assume that there will soon be implantable myoelectric sensors which will enable the internal MES to be used as input to these controllers. An internal MES measurement should have less muscular crosstalk allowing for more independent control sites. However, it remains unclear if this benefit outweighs the loss of the more global information contained in the surface MES. This paper compares the classification accuracy of six pattern recognition-based myoelectric controllers which use multi-channel surface MES as inputs to the same controllers which use multi-channel intramuscular MES as inputs. An experiment was designed during which surface and intramuscular MES were collected simultaneously for 10 different classes of isometric contraction. There was no significant difference in classification accuracy as a result of using the intramuscular MES measurement technique when compared to the surface MES measurement technique.

"A Full-Bridge Resonant Inverter With Modified Phase-Shift Modulation for High-Frequency AC Power Distribution Systems","Z. Ye; P. K. Jain; P. C. Sen","Intersil Corp., Milpitas; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","","2007","54","5","2831","2845","The design of a resonant inverter for high-frequency ac (HFAC) power distribution systems is complicated by the following three factors: 1) A number of electronic loads located in different locations are connected to the resonant inverter, the impedance, and the power factor of the equivalent load of which varies over a wider range than a system with a certain load; 2) the resonant inverter is subject to an input-line voltage varying over a wide range; and 3) the characteristics of the resonant inverter depend on the load impedance. It is mandatory to operate the inverter with zero-voltage switching under various load conditions of different power factors and over wide input variations. It is further desirable that multiple resonant inverters can be paralleled with simple current-sharing control (CSC). A phase-shift- modulation (PSM)-controlled full-bridge series-parallel resonant inverter is proposed for the HFAC power distribution architectures. A new PSM method is proposed with which the phase angle of the inverter output voltage is independent of the modulation signal of the phase-shift modulator. Such a feature allows multiple resonant inverters to operate in parallel with a magnitude CSC. The resonant inverter is analyzed with a general nonresistive load model, and the design curves are developed. A prototype resonant inverter system is designed and implemented with an operation frequency of 1 MHz, a rated output power of 150 W, and a sinusoidal output voltage of 1-MHz 28-V rms. The proposed resonant inverter has the advantages of high efficiency over wide input/output line variations, high waveform quality of the output voltage, and phase-angle independence of the voltage-feedback/feed-forward control and CSC.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2007.896030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4294279","Full bridge;phase-shift modulation (PSM);power distribution architecture;resonant inverter;soft switching","Resonant inverters;Phase modulation;Power distribution;Impedance;Reactive power;Zero voltage switching;Load modeling;Power system modeling;Prototypes;Frequency","bridge circuits;flexible AC transmission systems;power distribution planning;power factor;resonant invertors","frequency 1 MHz;power 150 W;voltage 28 V;full-bridge resonant inverter;modified phase-shift modulation;high-frequency ac power distribution systems;zero-voltage switching;current-sharing control;series-parallel resonant inverter;general nonresistive load model","","57","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Uncertain information can create imperfect expressions for pattern sets in various pattern recognition algorithms. Therefore, various types of uncertainty may be taken into account when performing several pattern recognition methods. When one performs clustering with fuzzy sets, fuzzy membership values express assignment availability of patterns for clusters. However, when one assigns fuzzy memberships to a pattern set, imperfect information for a pattern set involves uncertainty which exist in the various parameters that are used in fuzzy membership assignment. When one encounters fuzzy clustering, fuzzy membership design includes various uncertainties (e.g., distance measure, fuzzifier, prototypes, etc.). In this paper, we focus on the uncertainty associated with the fuzzifier parameter m that controls the amount of fuzziness of the final C-partition in the fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm. To design and manage uncertainty for fuzzifier m, we extend a pattern set to interval type-2 fuzzy sets using two fuzzifiers m1  and m2 which creates a footprint of uncertainty (FOU) for the fuzzifier m. Then, we incorporate this interval type-2 fuzzy set into FCM to observe the effect of managing uncertainty from the two fuzzifiers. We also provide some solutions to type-reduction and defuzzification (i.e., cluster center updating and hard-partitioning) in FCM.

The efficiency of the new algorithm enables its application to problems that were previously prohibitive due to high time complexities. The proposed EMD-L1 significantly simplifies the original linear programming formulation of EMD. Exploiting the L1 metric structure, the number of unknown variables in EMD-L1 is reduced to O(N) from O(N2) of the original EMD for a histogram with N bins. In addition, the number of constraints is reduced by half and the objective function of the linear program is simplified. Formally, without any approximation, we prove that the EMD-L1 formulation is equivalent to the original EMD with a L1 ground distance. To perform the EMD-L1 computation, we propose an efficient tree-based algorithm, Tree-EMD. Tree-EMD exploits the fact that a basic feasible solution of the simplex algorithm-based solver forms a spanning tree when we interpret EMD-L1 as a network flow optimization problem. We empirically show that this new algorithm has an average time complexity of O(N2), which significantly improves the best reported supercubic complexity of the original EMD. The accuracy of the proposed methods is evaluated by experiments for two computation-intensive problems: shape recognition and interest point matching using multidimensional histogram-based local features. For shape recognition, EMD-L1 is applied to compare shape contexts on the widely tested MPEG7 shape data set, as well as an articulated shape data set. For interest point matching, SIFT, shape context and spin image are tested on both synthetic and real image pairs with large geometrical deformation, illumination change, and heavy intensity noise.

This is achieved by having the users relay each others messages and thus forming multiple transmission paths to the destination. In resource constrained networks, such as wireless sensor networks, the advantages of cooperation can be further exploited by optimally allocating the energy and bandwidth resources among users based on the available channel state information (CSI) at each node. In the first part of this article, we provide a tutorial survey on various power allocation strategies for cooperative networks based on different cooperation strategies, optimizing criteria, and CSI assumptions. In the second part, we identify the similarities between cooperative networks and several sensor network applications that utilize collaboration among distributed sensors to achieve the system goal.

The compression method is based on the multiple reference picture technique in the H.264/AVC video coding standard. The idea is to exploit the statistical dependencies from both temporal and inter-view reference pictures for motion-compensated prediction. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by an experimental analysis of temporal versus inter-view prediction in terms of the Lagrange cost function. The results show that prediction with temporal reference pictures is highly efficient, but for 20% of a picture's blocks on average prediction with reference pictures from adjacent views is more efficient. Hierarchical B pictures are used as basic structure for temporal prediction. Their advantages are combined with inter-view prediction for different temporal hierarchy levels, starting from simulcast coding with no inter-view prediction up to full level inter-view prediction. When using inter-view prediction at key picture temporal levels, average gains of 1.4-dB peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) are reported, while additionally using inter-view prediction at nonkey picture temporal levels, average gains of 1.6-dB PSNR are reported. For some cases, gains of more than 3 dB, corresponding to bit-rate savings of up to 50%, are obtained.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2007.903665","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4358661","3-D television (3DTV);free viewpoint video;H.264/AVC;hierarchical B pictures;multiview video coding (MVC);Multi-view Video Coding;3D television;free viewpoint video;hierarchical B pictures;H.264/AVC","Video coding;Image coding;Video compression;Layout;Automatic voltage control;PSNR;Cameras;Computer graphics;Streaming media;Decoding","data compression;motion compensation;video coding","prediction structures;multiview video coding;compression method;multiple reference picture technique;H.264/AVC video coding standard;inter-view reference pictures;motion-compensated prediction;Lagrange cost function;hierarchical B pictures;temporal prediction;simulcast coding;3D television","","445","","51","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus they have rejected the speed, glamour and personal expression of automobiles in favor of modest, slow. and community-building horse- drawn buggies. Second, they deliberately choose tools that are different from those used by the outside world.

Assisted with clinical evaluation, designers, engineers, and scientists have built a device for robotic assisted upper extremity repetitive therapy (RUPERT). Intense, repetitive physical rehabilitation has been shown to be beneficial overcoming upper extremity deficits, but the therapy is labor intensive and expensive and difficult to evaluate quantitatively and objectively. The RUPERT is developed to provide a low cost, safe and easy-to-use, robotic-device to assist the patient and therapist to achieve more systematic therapy at home or in the clinic. The RUPERT has four actuated degrees-of-freedom driven by compliant and safe pneumatic muscles (PMs) on the shoulder, elbow, and wrist. They are programmed to actuate the device to extend the arm and move the arm in 3-D space. It is very important to note that gravity is not compensated and the daily tasks are practiced in a natural setting. Because the device is wearable and lightweight to increase portability, it can be worn standing or sitting providing therapy tasks that better mimic activities of daily living. The sensors feed back position and force information for quantitative evaluation of task performance. The device can also provide real-time, objective assessment of functional improvement. We have tested the device on stroke survivors performing two critical activities of daily living (ADL): reaching out and self feeding.

Evolution toward the phase called ""full mobility"" provides incremental support for low latency, low packet loss and real-time handoff of subscriber terminals operating at high speeds.

In this paper, we explore the feasibility of a distributed beamforming approach to this problem, with a cluster of distributed transmitters emulating a centralized antenna array so as to transmit a common message signal coherently to a distant base station. The potential SNR gains from beamforming are well-known. However, realizing these gains requires synchronization of the individual carrier signals in phase and frequency. In this paper we show that a large fraction of the beamforming gains can be realised even with imperfect synchronization corresponding to phase errors with moderately large variance. We present a master-slave architecture where a designated master transmitter coordinates the synchronization of other (slave) transmitters for beamforming. We observe that the transmitters can achieve distributed beamforming with minimal coordination with the base station using channel reciprocity. Thus, inexpensive local coordination with a master transmitter makes the expensive communication with a distant base station receiver more efficient. However, the duplexing constraints of the wireless channel place a fundamental limitation on the achievable accuracy of synchronization. We present a stochastic analysis that demonstrates the robustness of beamforming gains with imperfect synchronization, and demonstrate a tradeoff between synchronization overhead and beamforming gains.

Our results clearly show that broadcasting in VANET is very different from routing in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) due to several reasons such as network topology, mobility patterns, demographics, traffic patterns at different times of the day, etc. These differences imply that conventional ad hoc routing protocols such as DSR and AODV will not be appropriate in VANETs for most vehicular broadcast applications. We identify three very different regimes that a vehicular broadcast protocol needs to work in: i) dense traffic regime; ii) sparse traffic regime; and iii) regular traffic regime. We build upon our previously proposed routing solutions for each regime and we show that the broadcast message can be disseminate efficiently. The proposed design of the distributed vehicular broadcast (DV-CAST) protocol integrates the use of various routing solutions we have previously proposed.","","978-1-4244-1690-5","10.1109/MOVE.2007.4300825","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4300825","","Broadcasting;Telecommunication traffic;Routing protocols;Mobile ad hoc networks;Storms;Spread spectrum communication;Ad hoc networks;Road safety;Global Positioning System;Electronic mail","ad hoc networks;broadcasting;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication traffic","broadcasting;VANET;vehicular ad hoc networks;multihop broadcast protocol;mobile ad hoc networks;MANET;network topology;mobility patterns;traffic patterns;ad hoc routing protocols;DSR;AODV;dense traffic regime;sparse traffic regime;regular traffic regime;distributed vehicular broadcast protocol;DV-CAST","","145","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The first of all reason is fossil fuels run low. One of the solutions allows avoiding the problem is local balancing of power production and power demand. The easiest to reach local non fossil carriers are wind, sun and water and biomass energy. But they are unstable and it is very hard to produce stable power from them. Microglia's were developed to solve the problem. The microgrid is small power system composed of power plants, controlled and uncontrolled loads and control system (just like in classic, huge power system). Because microgrid is rather small it has to be an automatic and operate without any staff. Hence, many electronic devices are necessary. First of all these are power plants controllers. The plants using in the microgrid are electronic devices. Also some loads are connected through electronic connection units. Power electronic converters are the most important part of both plants and connections. The paper discusses some problems of power electronic converters in author's DC microgrid. The converters are divided into groups depending of their destination.

It is a standard, wound rotor induction machine with its stator windings directly connected to the grid and its rotor windings connected to the grid through an AC/DC/AC PWM converter. The AC/DC/AC converter normally consists of a machine-side converter and a grid-side converter, both of which are controlled by decoupled d- q control approaches. In order to gain proper control of a DFIG and appropriate DFIG integration with the grid, it is important to understand the power control characteristics of the two AC/DC converters. This paper focuses on the analysis of traditional decoupled d-q vector control approaches for control of DFIG wind turbines. A typical d-q control concept that has been used widely in DFIG converter control is reviewed in the paper. Then, detailed study is performed to investigate the power control characteristics of DFIG converter using decoupled d-q control approaches. Deficiencies of conventional d-q control mechanisms are discovered and analyzed both analytically and through computer simulation. An extensive simulation study is performed to examine the power control characteristics of DFIG PWM converter under different d-q control conditions.","1932-5517","1-4244-1296-X","10.1109/PES.2007.385461","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4275343","doubly-fed inductor generator;power electronic converter;d-q vector control;simulation","Pulse width modulation converters;Analog-digital conversion;Power control;Machine vector control;Induction generators;Induction machines;Wind turbines;Rotors;Stator windings;Wounds","asynchronous generators;power control;PWM power convertors;stators;wind turbines","AC/DC/AC PWM converter;decoupled d-q vector control;doubly-fed induction generator;variable speed induction machine;wind turbine generators;stator windings;rotor windings;machine-side converter;power control;computer simulation","","35","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different designs and technical advances now make it possible to put wind turbines off shore. The fast expansion of the wind power market comes with problems. The new designs are not always fully tested, and the designed 20 year lifetime is typically never achieved before the next generation of turbines is erected. This paper presents results from an investigation of failure statistics from four sources, i.e. two separate sources from Sweden, one from Finland, and one from Germany. Statistics reveal reliability performance of the different components within the wind turbine. The gearbox is the most critical because downtime, per failure, is high compared to the other components in the wind power turbine. The statistical data for larger turbines also show trends toward higher, ever increasing failure frequency when compared to small turbines, which have a decreasing failure rate over the operational years.","1932-5517","1-4244-1296-X","10.1109/PES.2007.386112","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4275878","Availability;Failures;Statistics;Reliability;Wind power generation","Wind energy;Wind turbines;Power system reliability;Maintenance;Statistics;Availability;Wind power generation;Wind energy generation;Frequency;Books","power markets;wind power plants;wind turbines","wind power systems;Swedish wind power plants;wind power industry;wind turbines;wind power market;Finland;Germany;time 1997 year to 2005 year","","59","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The algorithms are designed aiming minimum estimation error in both transient and steady state over a wide velocity range, including very low and persistent zero-speed operation. A major challenge at very low and zero speed is the lost coupling effect from the rotor to the stator, which makes the information on rotor variables unobservable on the stator side. As a solution to this problem, in this paper, the load torque and the rotor angular velocity are simultaneously estimated, with the velocity taken into consideration via the equation of motion and not as a constant parameter, which is commonly the case in most past studies. The estimation of load torque, on the other hand, is performed as a constant parameter to account for Coulomb and viscous friction at steady state to improve the estimation performance at very low and zero speed. The estimation algorithms developed based on the rotor and stator fluxes are experimentally tested under challenging variations and reversals of the velocity and load torque (step-type and varying linearly with velocity) over a wide velocity range and at zero speed. In all the scenarios, the current estimation error has remained within a very narrow error band, also yielding acceptable velocity estimation errors, which motivate the use of the developed estimation method in sensorless control of IMs over a wide velocity range and persistent zero-speed operation","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2006.885123","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4084641","Extended Kalman filter (EKF);induction motor (IM);low/zero-speed operation;sensorless control","Induction motors;Estimation error;Stators;Torque;Steady-state;State estimation;Algorithm design and analysis;Couplings;Rotors;Angular velocity","angular velocity control;friction;induction motors;Kalman filters;machine vector control;torque control","speed-sensorless field-oriented control;induction motors;extended Kalman-filter-based estimation algorithms;direct-torque control;minimum estimation error;load torque estimation;rotor angular velocity;Coulomb friction;viscous friction;zero-speed operation","","201","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While the measured TBR of about 3.3 x 10-8 W-1 ldr m2 ldr K for devices on SiC and Si substrates has a sizeable effect on the self-heating in devices, the TBR of up to 1.2 x 10-8 W-1 ldr m2 ldr K plays an insignificant role in devices on sapphire substrates due to the low thermal conductivity of the substrate.

The distributed nature of the RAN architecture calls for new radio control algorithms and procedures that operate in a distributed manner, including a distributed handover scheme as well. The most important aspects of the handover procedure in LTE has been already settled in 3GPP except a few details. In this paper we give an overview of the LTE intra-access handover procedure and evaluate its performance focusing on the user perceived performance aspects of it. We investigate the necessity of packet forwarding from a TCP throughput point of view, we analyse the problem of out of order packet delivery during handover and propose a simple solution for it. Finally, we investigate the impact of HARQ/ARQ state discard at handover on the radio efficiency.

Single stage topologies seem to be a rather attractive solution, for these applications, since in generally they are characterised by high efficiency, low cost and simple structure with high reliability due to reduced components count. On the other hand in single-phase AC-PV Module inverters, the power that is transferred to the power network has a large amount of power pulsation at twice line frequency. So a large ripple of voltage and current appears at the PV module output. Taking into account that there is a close correspondence between the power that flows from a PV module and the point of operation, this fact leads to reduced PV power generation. In order to overcome this defect, this paper presents a novel current pulsation smoothing parallel active filter (CPS-PAF) which is independent from the inverter topology and his operation mode. Purpose of the proposed CPS-PAF is the elimination of the low frequency PV current ripple. So the PV module can be operated close enough to the maximum power point and consequently the PV generated electricity power is maximised. The CPS-PAF conception, control and effectiveness are validated by PSpice simulation and experimental results accomplished on a laboratory prototype.","","978-92-75815-10-8","10.1109/EPE.2007.4417545","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4417545","Renewable energy systems;Photovoltaic;Design;Generation of electrical energy;Converter Control","Active filters;Smoothing methods;Inverters;Frequency;Power generation;Network topology;Costs;Power system reliability;Voltage;Laboratories","active filters;photovoltaic power systems;power filters;power grids","parallel active filter;current pulsation smoothing;single stage grid-connected AC-photovoltaic modules;power pulsation;voltage ripple;photovoltaic current ripple;maximum power point;renewable energy systems;converter control","","113","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

High speed, very large number of components, large number of supported protocols, and the addition of ready- to-use intellectual property cores make programmable devices the preferred choice of implementation and even deployment in mass production quantities. This paper surveys the advanced features, design tools, and application domains for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The main characteristics and structure of modern FPGAs are first described to show their versatility and abundance of available design resources.

Its key component is a new control technique for full-body balancing in the presence of external forces, which is presented and then validated empirically. We have adopted an integrated system approach to develop humanoid robots. Herein, we describe the importance of replicating human-like capabilities and responses during human-robot interaction in this context. Our balancing controller provides gravity compensation, making the robot passive and thereby facilitating safe physical interactions. The method operates by setting an appropriate ground reaction force and transforming these forces into full-body joint torques. It handles an arbitrary number of force interaction points on the robot. It does not require force measurement at interested contact points. It requires neither inverse kinematics nor inverse dynamics. It can adapt to uneven ground surfaces. It operates as a force control process, and can therefore, accommodate simultaneous control processes using force-, velocity-, or position-based control. Forces are distributed over supporting contact points in an optimal manner. Joint redundancy is resolved by damping injection in the context of passivity. We present various force interaction experiments using our full-sized bipedal humanoid platform, including compliant balance, even when affected by unknown external forces, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the method.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2007.904896","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4339533","Balance;biped robot;compliance;force control;full-body motion control;human–humanoid interaction;passivity;redundancy","Humanoid robots;Human robot interaction;Force control;Velocity control;Telecommunication computing;Gravity;Kinematics;Process control;Damping;Orbital robotics","force control;humanoid robots;legged locomotion;position control;robot dynamics;robot kinematics","biped robot;compliant balance;bipedal humanoid platform;position-based control;force control;humanoid robots;full-body compliant human-humanoid interaction","","219","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although FBGs are often referring to permanent refractive index modulation in the fiber core, exposure to high-temperature environments usually results in the bleach of the refractive index modulation. The maximum temperature reported for the conventional FBG temperature sensor is around 600 degC due to its weak bonds of germanium and oxygen. In this paper, we report design and development of a novel high-temperature resistance FBG temperature sensor, based on the hydrogen-loaded germanium-doped FBG. The refractive index modulation in the FBG is induced by the molecular water. The results of our experiments have shown that the stability of the device is substantially increased at high temperature range. Due to the high bonds energy of hydroxyl and the low diffusivity of the molecular water, the thermal testing results of this temperature sensor show the thermal stability of hydrogen-loaded FBG can be increased by using annealing treatment; moreover, the highest erasing temperature for the device could reach to 1100 degC or more. The reflectivity of this new FBG depends on the concentration of Si-OH and indirectly related to the reflectivity of hydrogen-loaded FBG.

This is in contrast to classical error detection where a failure is detected after errors appear in system data and states. Circuit failure prediction is performed during system operation by analyzing the data collected by sensors inserted at various locations inside a chip. We demonstrate this concept of circuit failure prediction for a dominant PMOS aging mechanism induced by negative bias temperature instability (NBTI). NBTI-induced PMOS aging slows down PMOS transistors over time. As a result, the speed of a chip can significantly degrade over time and can result in delay faults. The traditional practice is to incorporate worst-case speed margins to prevent delay faults during system operation due to NBTI aging. A new sensor design integrated inside a flip-flop enables efficient circuit failure prediction at a low cost. Simulation results using 90nm and 65nm technologies demonstrate that this technique can significantly improve system performance by enabling close to best-case design instead of traditional worst-case design.","2375-1053","0-7695-2812-0","10.1109/VTS.2007.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4209925","","Aging;Niobium compounds;Titanium compounds;Circuit faults;Data analysis;Failure analysis;Performance analysis;Sensor systems;Negative bias temperature instability;MOSFETs","ageing;failure analysis;flip-flops;integrated circuit testing;MOSFET","circuit failure prediction;transistor aging;system data;system states;classical error detection;system operation;dominant PMOS aging mechanism;negative bias temperature instability;PMOS transistors;delay faults;NBTI aging;flip-flop;65 nm;90 nm","","293","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While cryptography is a powerful tool to achieve information security, one of the main challenges in cryptosystems is to maintain the secrecy of the cryptographic keys. Though biometric authentication can be used to ensure that only the legitimate user has access to the secret keys, a biometric system itself is vulnerable to a number of threats. A critical issue in biometric systems is to protect the template of a user which is typically stored in a database or a smart card. The fuzzy vault construct is a biometric cryptosystem that secures both the secret key and the biometric template by binding them within a cryptographic framework. We present a fully automatic implementation of the fuzzy vault scheme based on fingerprint minutiae. Since the fuzzy vault stores only a transformed version of the template, aligning the query fingerprint with the template is a challenging task. We extract high curvature points derived from the fingerprint orientation field and use them as helper data to align the template and query minutiae. The helper data itself do not leak any information about the minutiae template, yet contain sufficient information to align the template and query fingerprints accurately. Further, we apply a minutiae matcher during decoding to account for nonlinear distortion and this leads to significant improvement in the genuine accept rate. We demonstrate the performance of the vault implementation on two different fingerprint databases. We also show that performance improvement can be achieved by using multiple fingerprint impressions during enrollment and verification.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2007.908165","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4378259","Biometric cryptosystems;fingerprint alignment;fuzzy vault;helper data;minutiae;minutiae mosaicing;polynomial reconstruction","Fingerprint recognition;Cryptography;Biometrics;Information security;Databases;Maintenance;Authentication;Protection;Smart cards;Data mining","cryptography;fingerprint identification","fingerprint-based fuzzy vault;information security mechanisms;cryptography;biometric authentication;biometric cryptosystem;nonlinear distortion;fingerprint databases","","318","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Of paramount importance for the reliability of power electronics is the component operating temperature and temperature cycling. This paper deals with the development of an advanced simulation tool which is capable of determining the component temperature of a three-phase converter over long mission profiles. In addition, the expected converter reliability is calculated. To accomplish this, losses in the semiconductors and dc-link capacitors are determined first. Next, this loss data is fed into a thermal model to compute the component temperatures, for the whole mission profile. As basis for the reliability computation, failure-rate catalogs, such as Military Handbook 217F or RDF 2000, are used. Also an approach using simple formulas for lifetime prediction is presented. According to failure-rate catalogs, temperature cycles are of particular importance for the reliability of power semiconductors. A novel algorithm, detecting all relevant temperature cycles within the computed temperature curve is developed.

Therefore it is necessary to analyse the transient stability of power systems, including wind turbine generator systems (WTGS). It has already been reported that one-mass or lumped model of wind turbine system is insufficient to analyse the transient behaviour of WTGS. It has also been reported that for the precise transient analysis of WTGS, a six-mass drive train model is needed. The reduced order models (three-mass and two-mass) have also been adopted so far for transient behaviour analysis. But the transient stability analysis of using six-mass, three-mass and two-mass drive train models has not been reported sufficiently so far in the literature. The authors have conducted an analysis using these methods. First, a detailed transformation procedure is presented from six-mass drive train model to two-mass model, which can be used in the analysis of transient stability simulation with sufficient accuracy. It is then determined which drive train model is appropriate for transient stability analysis of grid-connected WTGS. The effects of drive train parameters (such as inertia constant, spring constant and damping constant) on stability are examined using the above mentioned types of drive train models. Moreover, different types of symmetrical and asymmetrical faults at different wind generator power levels are considered in the simulation analyses with and without considering damping constants in six-mass, three-mass and two-mass shaft models. Considering the simulation results, it can be concluded that two-mass shaft model is sufficient for the transient stability analysis of WTGS.","1752-1424","","10.1049/iet-rpg:20060030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4240144","","","damping;power generation faults;power system transient stability;wind turbines","transient stability analysis;wind turbine generator system;drive train models;power systems;six-mass model;reduced order models;two-mass models;three-mass models;inertia constant;spring constant;damping constant;asymmetrical faults;symmetrical faults;simulation results;two-mass shaft model;grid-connected WTGS","","75","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals"

For the first time, a universal circuit-compatible CNFET model including the practical device nonidealities is implemented with HSPICE. In addition to the nonidealities included in the companion paper, this paper includes the elastic scattering in the channel region, the resistive source/drain (S/D), the Schottky-barrier resistance, and the parasitic gate capacitances. More than one nanotube per device can be modeled. Compared to silicon technology, the CNFETs show much better device performance based on the intrinsic gate-delay metric (six times for nFET and 14 times for pFET) than the MOSFET device at the 32-nm node, even with device nonidealities.

"Dynamic spectrum allocation in cognitive radio using hidden Markov models: Poisson distributed case","I. A. Akbar; W. H. Tranter","Mobile & Portable Radio Res. Group, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA; NA","Proceedings 2007 IEEE SoutheastCon","","2007","","","196","201","Cognitive radio networks can be designed to manage the radio spectrum more efficiently by utilizing the spectrum holes in primary users' licensed frequency bands. Recent studies have shown that the radio spectrum is poorly utilized by the licensed users even in urban geographical areas. This spectrum utilization can be improved significantly by making it possible for secondary users (who are not being served by the primary system) to access spectrum holes, i.e., frequency bands not used by licensed users. In this novel work, we use hidden Markov models (HMMs) to model and predict the spectrum occupancy of licensed radio bands. The proposed technique can dynamically select different licensed bands for its own use with significantly less interference from and to the licensed users. It is found that by predicting the duration of spectrum holes of primary users, the CR can utilize them more efficiently by leaving the band, that it currently occupies, before the start of traffic from the primary user of that band. We propose a simple algorithm, called the Markov-based channel prediction algorithm (MCPA), for dynamic spectrum allocation in cognitive radio networks. In this work, we present the performance of our proposed dynamic spectrum allocation algorithm when the channel state occupancy of primary users are assumed to be Poisson distributed. The impact of CR transmission on the licensed users is also presented. It is shown that significant SIR improvements can be achieved using HMM based dynamic spectrum allocation as compared to the traditional CSMA based approach. The results obtained using HMM are very promising and HMM can offer a new paradigm for predicting channel behavior in cognitive radio, an area that has been of much research interest lately.","1558-058X","1-4244-1028-2","10.1109/SECON.2007.342884","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4147414","","Cognitive radio;Hidden Markov models;Frequency;Chromium;Heuristic algorithms;Radio spectrum management;Predictive models;Interference;Telecommunication traffic;Prediction algorithms","channel allocation;cognitive radio;hidden Markov models;Poisson distribution;wireless channels","dynamic spectrum allocation;hidden Markov models;Poisson distributed case;cognitive radio networks;radio spectrum management;spectrum holes;licensed users;spectrum utilization;spectrum occupancy;licensed radio bands;Markov-based channel prediction algorithm;channel state occupancy;channel behavior","","132","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In induction wind generators, unbalanced three-phase stator voltages cause a number of problems, such as overcurrent, unbalanced currents, reactive power pulsations, and stress on the mechanical components from torque pulsations. Therefore, beyond a certain amount of unbalance, induction wind generators are switched out of the network. This can further weaken the grid. In doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs), control of the rotor currents allows for adjustable speed operation and reactive power control.

Based on this hypothesis, we propose an algorithm for color constancy. Contrary to existing color constancy algorithms, which are computed from the zero-order structure of images, our method is based on the derivative structure of images. Furthermore, we propose a framework which unifies a variety of known (gray-world, max-RGB, Minkowski norm) and the newly proposed gray-edge and higher order gray-edge algorithms. The quality of the various instantiations of the framework is tested and compared to the state-of-the-art color constancy methods on two large data sets of images recording objects under a large number of different light sources.

Also considered may be the deviation of a given voltage schedule, voltage stability margin, or even a combination of different objectives as a multi-objective model. Secondly, different constraints in RPP are discussed. These different constraints are the key of various optimization models, identified as optimal power flow (OPF) model, security-constrained OPF (SCOPF) model, and SCOPF with voltage-stability consideration. Thirdly, the optimization-based models will be categorized as conventional algorithms, intelligent searches, and fuzzy set applications. The conventional algorithms include linear programming, nonlinear programming, mixed-integer nonlinear programming, etc. The intelligent searches include simulated annealing, evolutionary algorithms, and tabu search.

The basic principle of the method is to make use of partial reconstructions of the signal, with the relevant IMFs corresponding to the most important structures of the signal (low-frequency components). A criterion is proposed to determine the IMF, after which, the energy distribution of the important structures of the signal overcomes that of the noise and that of the high-frequency components of the signal.

This important feature is attributed to the salient integration of an impedance-transforming quadrature coupler with equalized series-resonated varactors. The impedance-transforming quadrature coupler is used to increase the maximal relative phase shift for a given varactor with a limited capacitance range. When the phase is tuned, the typical large insertion-loss variation of the phase shifter due to the varactor parasitic effect is minimized by shunting the series-resonated varactor with a resistor Rp. A set of closed-form equations for predicting the relative phase shift, insertion loss, and insertion-loss variation with respect to the quadrature coupler and varactor parameters is derived. Three phase shifters were implemented with a silicon varactor of a restricted capacitance range of Cv,min = 1.4 pF and Cv,max = 8 pF, wherein the parasitic resistance is close to 2 Omega. The measured insertion-loss variation is 0.1 dB over the relative phase-shift tuning range of 237deg at 2 GHz and the return losses are better than 20 dB, excellently agreeing with the theoretical and simulated results.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2007.903346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4298211","Branch-line coupler;phase shifter;varactor","Phase shifters;Insertion loss;Varactors;Impedance;Parasitic capacitance;Resistors;Equations;Silicon;Electrical resistance measurement;Loss measurement","microwave phase shifters;varactors;waveguide couplers","reflection-type phase shifter;relative phase-shift range;impedance-transforming quadrature coupler;equalized series-resonated varactors;insertion-loss variation;varactor parasitic effect;frequency 2 GHz","","59","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown that a bank of resonant filters, used as a refinement term for harmonic compensation in earlier works, is equivalent to a repetitive scheme with a particular structure. The latter is implemented using a simple feedback array with a delay line, thus making the implementation relatively easy. More precisely, the repetitive scheme takes a negative feedback structure plus a feedforward path whenever the odd harmonics are considered for compensation only. The repetitive scheme, equivalent to the bank of resonant filters, acts as a refinement term to reject the harmonic distortion caused by the unbalanced and distorted load current, and thus, allowing the UPS inverter to deliver an almost pure sinusoidal balanced voltage.

Bombardier Transportation has equipped one bogie of a prototype LRV (light rail vehicle) for the public transportation operator RNV in Mannheim with a MITRAC Energy Saver. Outstanding feature is the daily operation of the energy storage unit in daily passenger service, and this even since September 2003. The experiences are very positive. The measured traction energy saving of approximately 30% confirmed fully the former calculations. Running the energy storage device on board of a tram brings additionally following benefits: (i) a dramatic reduction of the peak power demand (ii) catenary free operation"" on several hundred meters without power supply from the catenary (iii) catenary free city center by on board storage and recharging stations. Applying the energy storage devices in Metro systems has a similar effect as in case of LRVs. However the savings distribution in the whole system will be a little bit different. Due to higher regeneration capability of metro systems the expected share of the train propulsion saving will be lower. It will be compensated by a considerable reduction of the line losses, especially for systems with low rated catenary voltages (600 V or 750 V). Very promising are energy storage applications in propulsion systems of diesel-electrical multiple units (DEMUs). These vehicles lack possibilities to use the braking energy of the train. Energy storage systems on board of DEMUs bring high fuel savings together with the corresponding emission reduction. On top of that the energy storage leads to a booster effect - extra power during acceleration from the storage, by adding the limited weight of the MITRAC Energy Saver.","","978-92-75815-10-8","10.1109/EPE.2007.4417400","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4417400","Energy storage;SuperCapacitors;Railway vehicles;Efficiency;Traction application","Energy storage;Rail transportation;Vehicles;Propulsion;Potential energy;Prototypes;Light rail systems;Energy measurement;Power demand;Power supplies","electric locomotives;electric propulsion;railways;supercapacitors;traction power supplies","UltraCaps;railway vehicles;on board energy storage system;light rail vehicle;energy storage unit;traction energy saving;energy storage device;recharging stations;train propulsion saving;line losses;diesel-electrical multiple units;braking energy;emission reduction;supercapacitors;traction application","","106","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the proposed PSO-based MA (PSOMA), both PSO-based searching operators and some special local searching operators are designed to balance the exploration and exploitation abilities. In particular, the PSOMA applies the evolutionary searching mechanism of PSO, which is characterized by individual improvement, population cooperation, and competition to effectively perform exploration. On the other hand, the PSOMA utilizes several adaptive local searches to perform exploitation. First, to make PSO suitable for solving PFSSP, a ranked-order value rule based on random key representation is presented to convert the continuous position values of particles to job permutations. Second, to generate an initial swarm with certain quality and diversity, the famous Nawaz-Enscore-Ham (NEH) heuristic is incorporated into the initialization of population. Third, to balance the exploration and exploitation abilities, after the standard PSO-based searching operation, a new local search technique named NEH_1 insertion is probabilistically applied to some good particles selected by using a roulette wheel mechanism with a specified probability. Fourth, to enrich the searching behaviors and to avoid premature convergence, a simulated annealing (SA)-based local search with multiple different neighborhoods is designed and incorporated into the PSOMA. Meanwhile, an effective adaptive meta-Lamarckian learning strategy is employed to decide which neighborhood to be used in SA-based local search. Finally, to further enhance the exploitation ability, a pairwise-based local search is applied after the SA-based search. Simulation results based on benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the PSOMA.

Accurate estimates of the state-of-charge (SOC), the state-of-health (SOH) and state-of-life (SOL) for batteries provide a significant value addition to the management of any operation involving electrical systems. This is especially true for aerospace systems, where unanticipated battery performance may lead to catastrophic failures. Batteries, composed of multiple electrochemical cells, are complex systems whose internal state variables are either inaccessible to sensors or hard to measure under operational conditions. In addition, battery performance is strongly influenced by ambient environmental and load conditions. Consequently, inference and estimation techniques need to be applied on indirect measurements, anticipated operational conditions and historical data, for which a Bayesian statistical approach is suitable. Accurate models of electro-chemical processes in the form of equivalent electric circuit parameters need to be combined with statistical models of state transitions, aging processes and measurement fidelity, need to be combined in a formal framework to make the approach viable. The RVM, which is a Bayesian treatment of the support vector machine (SVM), is used for diagnosis as well as for model development. The PF framework uses this model and statistical estimates of the noise in the system and anticipated operational conditions to provide estimates of SOC, SOH and SOL. Validation of this approach on experimental data from Li-ion batteries is presented.","1558-4550","978-1-4244-1238-9","10.1109/AUTEST.2007.4374280","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4374280","","Monitoring;Bayesian methods;State estimation;Battery management systems;Battery charge measurement;Support vector machines;Energy management;Uncertainty;Particle filters;Power system management","battery management systems;Bayes methods;cells (electric);regression analysis;state estimation;support vector machines","battery health monitoring;Bayesian regression;state estimation;relevance vector machine;particle filters;battery performance;support vector machine","","60","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Mukherjee","California Univ., Davis; NA; NA","Journal of Lightwave Technology","","2007","25","11","3329","3340","The hybrid wireless-optical broadband-access network (WOBAN) is a promising architecture for future access networks. Recently, the wireless part of WOBAN has been gaining increasing attention, and early versions are being deployed as municipal access solutions to eliminate the wired drop to every wireless router at customer premises. This architecture saves on network deployment cost because the fiber need not penetrate each end-user, and it extends the reach of emerging optical-access solutions, such as passive optical networks. This paper first presents an architecture and a vision for the WOBAN and articulates why the combination of wireless and optical presents a compelling solution that optimizes the best of both worlds. While this discussion briefly touches upon the business drivers, the main arguments are based on technical and deployment considerations. Consequently, the rest of this paper reviews a variety of relevant research challenges, namely, network setup, network connectivity, and fault-tolerant behavior of the WOBAN. In the network setup, we review the design of a WOBAN where the back end is a wired optical network, the front end is managed by a wireless connectivity, and, in between, the tail ends of the optical part [known as optical network unit (ONU)] communicate directly with wireless base stations (known as ldquogateway routersrdquo). We outline algorithms to optimize the placement of ONUs in a WOBAN and report on a survey that we conducted on the distribution and types of wireless routers in the Wildhorse residential neighborhood of North Davis, CA. Then, we examine the WOBAN's routing properties (network connectivity), discuss the pros and cons of various routing algorithms, and summarize the idea behind fault-tolerant design of such hybrid networks.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2007.906804","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4357916","Architecture;broadband access;fault tolerance;optical network;routing;wireless network;Architecture;broadband access;fault tolerance;optical network;routing;wireless network","Optical network units;Optical fiber networks;Passive optical networks;Fault tolerance;Routing;Costs;Optical design;Tail;Wireless communication;Base stations","broadband networks;optical fibre subscriber loops;radio-over-fibre;reviews;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing","hybrid wireless-optical broadband-access network;review;municipal access solutions;network deployment cost;optical-access solutions;passive optical networks;network setup;network connectivity;fault-tolerant behavior;wireless connectivity;optical network unit;wireless routers;Wildhorse residential neighborhood;WOBAN routing properties;routing algorithms","","217","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There is thus a growing imperative to understand and quantify the technical impact that high penetrations of such generators may have on the operation and performance of electricity distribution systems. Detailed simulations of a very high penetration of PV within a typical UK urban distribution network (11 kV, 400 V and 230 V) are reported. The study performed unbalanced three-phase load-flow analysis on an entire feeder within a time-domain simulation framework using load and generation data at 1 minute intervals. The results indicate that even at very high penetrations of PV, network voltage rises are small and unlikely to cause problems.

Our algorithm is multimodal (2D and 3D) and performs hybrid (feature based and holistic) matching in order to achieve efficiency and robustness to facial expressions. The pose of a 3D face along with its texture is automatically corrected using a novel approach based on a single automatically detected point and the Hotelling transform. A novel 3D spherical face representation (SFR) is used in conjunction with the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) descriptor to form a rejection classifier, which quickly eliminates a large number of candidate faces at an early stage for efficient recognition in case of large galleries. The remaining faces are then verified using a novel region-based matching approach, which is robust to facial expressions. This approach automatically segments the eyes- forehead and the nose regions, which are relatively less sensitive to expressions and matches them separately using a modified iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. The results of all the matching engines are fused at the metric level to achieve higher accuracy. We use the FRGC benchmark to compare our results to other algorithms that used the same database. Our multimodal hybrid algorithm performed better than others by achieving 99.74 percent and 98.31 percent verification rates at a 0.001 false acceptance rate (FAR) and identification rates of 99.02 percent and 95.37 percent for probes with a neutral and a nonneutral expression, respectively.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1105","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4302759","Biometrics;face recognition;rejection classifier;3D shape representation","Face recognition;Face detection;Iterative algorithms;Robustness;Karhunen-Loeve transforms;Forehead;Nose;Iterative methods;Iterative closest point algorithm;Engines","face recognition;feature extraction;image matching;iterative methods;transforms","automatic face recognition;FRGC v2.0 data;hybrid matching;feature based matching;holistic matching;facial expressions;3D face posing;Hotelling transform;3D spherical face representation;scale-invariant feature transform;SIFT descriptor;region-based matching;iterative closest point algorithm","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biometry;Face;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","319","","50","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional approaches require applying a battery of different classifiers to the image, at multiple locations and scales. This can be slow and can require a lot of training data since each classifier requires the computation of many different image features. In particular, for independently trained detectors, the (runtime) computational complexity and the (training-time) sample complexity scale linearly with the number of classes to be detected. We present a multitask learning procedure, based on boosted decision stumps, that reduces the computational and sample complexity by finding common features that can be shared across the classes (and/or views). The detectors for each class are trained jointly, rather than independently. For a given performance level, the total number of features required and, therefore, the runtime cost of the classifier, is observed to scale approximately logarithmically with the number of classes. The features selected by joint training are generic edge-like features, whereas the features chosen by training each class separately tend to be more object-specific.

Our study for signalling includes the two well known digital (decode and forward) relaying, analogue (amplify and forward) relaying, and a novel hybrid (filter, amplify and forward) relaying. We propose both optimal and suboptimal hybrid relaying schemes which avoid full decoding of the message at the relay. We show that they outperform analogue relaying and give similar performance to digital relaying, particularly when the relay has forward channel state information (CSI) or larger number of antennas than the source and destination. For the routing schemes designed for multiple relay channels, we use relay selection schemes to exploit the spatial diversity, which we call selection diversity of the networks. We propose both optimal and suboptimal relay selection schemes and show that their performance converges when a large number of antennas is deployed at each node in the network. We also compare relay selection routing with a space-time coded relay cooperation protocol and show the performance advantage of selection diversity over cooperative diversity in certain scenarios.

SPADs implemented in planar technology compatible with CMOS circuits offer typical advantages of microelectronic devices (small size, ruggedness, low voltage, low power, etc.). Furthermore, they have inherently higher photon detection efficiency, since they do not rely on electron emission in vacuum from a photocathode as do PMTs, but instead on the internal photoelectric effect. However, PMTs offer much wider sensitive area, which greatly simplifies the design of optical systems; they also attain remarkable performance at high counting rate, and offer picosecond timing resolution with microchannel plate models. In order to make SPAD detectors more competitive in a broader range of SPC and TCSPC applications, it is necessary to face several issues in the semiconductor device design and technology. Such issues will be discussed in the context of the two possible approaches to such a challenge: employing a standard industrial high-voltage CMOS technology or developing a dedicated CMOS-compatible technology.

Malware analysis is the process of determining the behavior and purpose of a given Malware sample (such as a virus, worm, or Trojan horse). This process is a necessary step to be able to develop effective detection techniques and removal tools. Currently, Malware analysis is mostly a manual process that is tedious and time-intensive. To mitigate this problem, a number of analysis tools have been proposed that automatically extract the behavior of an unknown program by executing it in a restricted environment and recording the operating system calls that are invoked. The problem of dynamic analysis tools is that only a single program execution is observed. Unfortunately, however, it is possible that certain malicious actions are only triggered under specific circumstances (e.g., on a particular day, when a certain file is present, or when a certain command is received). In this paper, we propose a system that allows us to explore multiple execution paths and identify malicious actions that are executed only when certain conditions are met. This enables us to automatically extract a more complete view of the program under analysis and identify under which circumstances suspicious actions are carried out. Our experimental results demonstrate that many Malware samples show different behavior depending on input read from the environment. Thus, by exploring multiple execution paths, we can obtain a more complete picture of their actions.","2375-1207","0-7695-2848-1","10.1109/SP.2007.17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4223228","","Computer worms;Operating systems;Invasive software;Data security;Databases;Humans;Virtual machining;Internet;Payloads;Computer viruses","invasive software;operating systems (computers);program diagnostics","multiple execution paths;malware analysis;malicious code;computer virus;worm;Trojan horse;operating system calls;dynamic analysis tools;single program execution","","203","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is thus possible to integrate several front-end mobile care devices with Bluetooth communication capability to extract patients' various physiological parameters [such as blood pressure, pulse, saturation of haemoglobin (SpO2), and electrocardiogram (ECG)], to monitor multiple physiological signals without space limit, and to upload important or abnormal physiological information to healthcare center for storage and analysis or transmit the information to physicians and healthcare providers for further processing. Thus, the physiological signal extraction devices only have to deal with signal extraction and wireless transmission. Since they do not have to do signal processing, their form factor can be further reduced to reach the goal of microminiaturization and power saving. An alert management mechanism has been included in back-end healthcare center to initiate various strategies for automatic emergency alerts after receiving emergency messages or after automatically recognizing emergency messages. Within the time intervals in system setting, according to the medical history of a specific patient, our prototype system can inform various healthcare providers in sequence to provide healthcare service with their reply to ensure the accuracy of alert information and the completeness of early warning notification to further improve the healthcare quality. In the end, with the testing results and performance evaluation of our implemented system prototype, we conclude that it is possible to set up a complete intelligent health care chain with mobile monitoring and healthcare service via the assistance of our system.","1558-0032","","10.1109/TITB.2006.888701","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4300837","Alert;Bluetooth;Java programming;mobile care;mobile phone;ubiquitous","Medical services;Biomedical monitoring;Mobile handsets;Mobile communication;Data mining;Patient monitoring;Condition monitoring;Bluetooth;Signal processing;Prototypes","Bluetooth;diseases;health care;knowledge based systems;mobile computing;mobile radio;patient care;patient monitoring;telemedicine","healthcare service;healthcare quality;emergency messages;back-end healthcare center;wireless transmission;signal extraction devices;information transmission;information analysis;information storage;front-end mobile care devices;physiological signal recognition algorithm;Bluetooth communication;mobile phone communication;chronic care environment;role-based intelligent mobile care system;professional medical care;health education;patient monitoring;physiological parameters;chronic diseases;arrhythmia;hypertension;alert mechanism;mobile care system","Cellular Phone;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electrocardiography, Ambulatory;Electrocardiography, Ambulatory;Feasibility Studies;Heart Diseases;Humans;Mobile Health Units;Pilot Projects;Remote Consultation;Remote Consultation;Remote Consultation;Taiwan","144","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Future u-Health monitoring systems will be essential equipment for mobile users under the ubiquitous computing environment. It is well known that the cost of energy expenditure in human walk or run changes with the speed of movement. Also the accurate walking distance is an important factor in calculating energy expenditure in human daily life. In order to compute the walking distance precisely, the number of occurred steps has to be counted exactly and the step length should be exactly estimated as well. However the step length varies considerably with the movement's speed and status. Therefore, we recognize the movement status such as walk or run of a pedestrian using the small-sized MEMS inertial sensors. Based on the result, a step length is estimated adaptively. The developed method can be applied to PNS and health monitoring mobile system.","","1-4244-0677-3","10.1109/SAS.2007.374406","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4248516","Adaptive algorithm;Step detection;Step length estimation;Pedestrian;PNS","Micromechanical devices;Costs;Monitoring;Humans;Legged locomotion;Navigation;Sensor systems;Mobile computing;Ubiquitous computing;Pervasive computing","adaptive estimation;condition monitoring;health care;microsensors;mobile radio;wireless sensor networks","adaptive step length estimation algorithm;pedestrian navigation system;u-Health monitoring systems;ubiquitous computing;mobile users;small-sized MEMS inertial sensors;health monitoring mobile system","","94","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A key component for VANET simulations is a realistic vehicular mobility model that ensures conclusions drawn from simulation experiments will carry through to real deployments. In this work, we introduce a tool MOVE that allows users to rapidly generate realistic mobility models for VANET simulations. MOVE is built on top of an open source micro-traffic simulator SUMO. The output of MOVE is a realistic mobility model and can be immediately used by popular network simulators such as ns-2 and qualnet.

However, because a technology's dependability requirements are proportional to its pervasiveness, newer applications mandate a deeper understanding of how much we can rely on WiFi and its security promises. In this article, we present an overview of WiFi vulnerabilities and investigate their proximate and ultimate origins. The intended goal is to provide a foundation to discuss WiFi dependability and its impact on current and future usage scenarios.

Traditionally, intrusion detection relies on extensive knowledge of security experts, in particular, on their familiarity with the computer system to be protected. To reduce this dependence, various data-mining and machine learning techniques have been deployed for intrusion detection. An IDS is usually working in a dynamically changing environment, which forces continuous tuning of the intrusion detection model, in order to maintain sufficient performance. The manual tuning process required by current systems depends on the system operators in working out the tuning solution and in integrating it into the detection model. In this paper, an automatically tuning IDS (ATIDS) is presented. The proposed system will automatically tune the detection model on-the-fly according to the feedback provided by the system operator when false predictions are encountered. The system is evaluated using the KDDCup'99 intrusion detection dataset. Experimental results show that the system achieves up to 35% improvement in terms of misclassification cost when compared with a system lacking the tuning feature. If only 10% false predictions are used to tune the model, the system still achieves about 30% improvement. Moreover, when tuning is not delayed too long, the system can achieve about 20% improvement, with only 1.3% of the false predictions used to tune the model. The results of the experiments show that a practical system can be built based on ATIDS: system operators can focus on verification of predictions with low confidence, as only those predictions determined to be false will be used to tune the detection model","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2006.885306","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4126299","Attack detection model;classification;data mining;intrusion detection;learning algorithm;model-tuning algorithm;self-organizing map (SOM)","Intrusion detection;Predictive models;Data security;Information security;Information systems;Computer security;Protection;Machine learning;Feedback;Costs","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","automatically tuning intrusion detection system;security layer;information systems;security experts knowledge;computer system;data-mining;machine learning techniques;dynamically changing environment;system operators","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Communication Networks;Computer Security;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","49","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents an adaptive notch filter (ANF) to achieve both these objectives. For noise reduction purpose, the proposed adaptive filter successfully extracts a single sinusoid of a possibly time-varying nature from a noise-corrupted signal. The paper proceeds with introducing a chain of filters which is capable of estimating the fundamental frequency of a signal composed of harmonically related sinusoids, and of decomposing it into its constituent components. The order of differential equations governing this algorithm is 2n+1, where n is the number of constituent sinusoids that should be extracted. Stability analysis of the proposed algorithm is carried out based on the application of the local averaging theory under the assumption of slow adaptation. When compared with the conventional Fourier analysis, the proposed method provides instantaneous values of the constituting components. Moreover, it is adaptive with respect to the fundamental frequency of the signal.

Despite improvements in FPGA densities, the numerous multipliers in an NN limit the size of the network that can be implemented using a single FPGA, thus making NN applications not viable commercially. The proposed implementation is aimed at reducing resource requirement, without much compromise on the speed, so that a larger NN can be realized on a single chip at a lower cost. The sequential processing of the layers in an NN has been exploited in this paper to implement large NNs using a method of layer multiplexing. Instead of realizing a complete network, only the single largest layer is implemented. The same layer behaves as different layers with the help of a control block. The control block ensures proper functioning by assigning the appropriate inputs, weights, biases, and excitation function of the layer that is currently being computed. Multilayer networks have been implemented using Xilinx FPGA ""XCV400hq240.""

The loose structure of folksonomy has led to ease in categorization of the huge amounts of information but has also given rise to some serious problems. Users tag information based on their own experiences, preferences and common sense. This leads to difficulties in search and organization of information in the long run. In this paper, we argue that since user common sense has generated both folksonomy and a corpus of machine common sense, it seems appropriate that machine common sense be used for addressing the problem of search in folksonomy. We outline an architecture for such an operation, develop a prototype as a proof of concept and describe how this approach can be extended in the future.","","978-1-4244-1246-4","10.1109/ICIET.2007.4381326","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4381326","","Intelligent systems;Internet;Organizing;Tagging;Search engines;Ontologies;Prototypes;Humans;Information technology;Manifolds","Internet;search engines","machine common sense;folksonomy;intelligent search system;Internet;Web2.0","","3","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a novel method, called Semi- supervised Discriminant Analysis (SDA), which makes use of both labeled and unlabeled samples. The labeled data points are used to maximize the separability between different classes and the unlabeled data points are used to estimate the intrinsic geometric structure of the data.

This measure is based on the evolution of the local statistics of the image between two dates. The local statistics are estimated by using a cumulant-based series expansion, which approximates probability density functions in the neighborhood of each pixel in the image. The degree of evolution of the local statistics is measured using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. An analytical expression for this detector is given, allowing a simple computation which depends on the four first statistical moments of the pixels inside the analysis window only. The proposed change indicator is compared to the classical mean ratio detector and also to other model-based approaches. Tests on the simulated and real data show that our detector outperforms all the others. The fast computation of the proposed detector allows a multiscale approach in the change detection for operational use. The so-called multiscale change profile (MCP) is introduced to yield change information on a wide range of scales and to better characterize the appropriate scale. Two simple yet useful examples of applications show that the MCP allows the design of change indicators, which provide better results than a monoscale analysis","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2007.893568","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4156318","Change detection;Edgeworth series expansion;Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence;multiscale change profile (MCP);multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images","Image analysis;Radar detection;Detectors;Synthetic aperture radar;Pixel;Image edge detection;Radar imaging;Noise robustness;Higher order statistics;Probability density function","geophysical techniques;radar imaging;synthetic aperture radar","statistical similarity measure;change detection;SAR images;Kullback-Leibler divergence","","295","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, current-source technology has been said to have drawbacks compared to voltage-source systems, such as high on-state losses in the PWM bridge and inefficient inductive energy storage element on the dc side of the bridge. In the paper, the two active filter topologies are compared. First, the main circuits and space-vector modulation techniques used are studied and the digital control systems are presented. The filtering performances of the systems with different kinds of nonlinear load are examined and finally the power losses of the active filters are studied.

A Gaussian mixture model (GMM) of the joint probability density of source and target features is employed for performing spectral conversion between speakers. The conventional method converts spectral parameters frame by frame based on the minimum mean square error. Although it is reasonably effective, the deterioration of speech quality is caused by some problems: 1) appropriate spectral movements are not always caused by the frame-based conversion process, and 2) the converted spectra are excessively smoothed by statistical modeling. In order to address those problems, we propose a conversion method based on the maximum-likelihood estimation of a spectral parameter trajectory. Not only static but also dynamic feature statistics are used for realizing the appropriate converted spectrum sequence. Moreover, the oversmoothing effect is alleviated by considering a global variance feature of the converted spectra. Experimental results indicate that the performance of VC can be dramatically improved by the proposed method in view of both speech quality and conversion accuracy for speaker individuality.","1558-7924","","10.1109/TASL.2007.907344","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4317579","Dynamic feature;global variance;Gaussian mixture model (GMM);maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE);voice conversion (VC)","Maximum likelihood estimation;Virtual colonoscopy;Loudspeakers;Speech enhancement;Parameter estimation;Mean square error methods;Speech processing;Statistics;Training data;Natural languages","Gaussian processes;least mean squares methods;maximum likelihood estimation;probability;spectral analysis;speech processing;speech synthesis","voice conversion;spectral conversion method;maximum-likelihood estimation;spectral parameter trajectory;Gaussian mixture model;joint probability density;minimum mean square error;speech quality;statistical modeling;speech synthesis","","391","","45","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes a new subdomain for infovis research that complements the focus on analytic tasks and expert use. Instead of work-related and analytically driven infovis, we propose casual information visualization (or casual infovis) as a complement to more traditional infovis domains. Traditional infovis systems, techniques, and methods do not easily lend themselves to the broad range of user populations, from expert to novices, or from work tasks to more everyday situations. We propose definitions, perspectives, and research directions for further investigations of this emerging subfield. These perspectives build from ambient information visualization (Skog et al., 2003), social visualization, and also from artistic work that visualizes information (Viegas and Wattenberg, 2007). We seek to provide a perspective on infovis that integrates these research agendas under a coherent vocabulary and framework for design. We enumerate the following contributions. First, we demonstrate how blurry the boundary of infovis is by examining systems that exhibit many of the putative properties of infovis systems, but perhaps would not be considered so.

The approach is traceable; it exploits the PDE-solver's ability to accept the definition of solutions to Maxwell's equations in so-called weak form. Associated expressions and methods for estimating a WG mode's volume, filling factor(s), and in the case of closed (open) resonators, its wall (radiation) loss, are provided. As no transverse approximation is imposed, the approach remains accurate even for quasi-transverse-magnetic/electric modes of low finite azimuthal mode order. The approach's generality and utility are demonstrated by modeling several nontrivial structures, i.e., 1) two different optical microcavities (one toroidal made of silica, the other an AlGaAs microdisk), 2) a third-order sapphire:air Bragg cavity, and 3) two different cryogenic sapphire WG-mode resonators; both 2) and 3) operate in the microwave X-band.

The voltage vector is then generated by an asymmetric cascaded multilevel inverter without need of modulation and filter. Due to the high output quality of the inverter, the torque response presents nearly no ripple. In addition, switching losses are greatly reduced since 80% of the power is delivered by the high-power cell of the asymmetric inverter, which commutates at fundamental frequency.

"Fault Detection Using the k-Nearest Neighbor Rule for Semiconductor Manufacturing Processes","Q. P. He; J. Wang","Tuskegee Univ., Tuskegee; NA","IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","","2007","20","4","345","354","It has been recognized that effective fault detection techniques can help semiconductor manufacturers reduce scrap, increase equipment uptime, and reduce the usage of test wafers. Traditional univariate statistical process control charts have long been used for fault detection. Recently, multivariate statistical fault detection methods such as principal component analysis (PCA)-based methods have drawn increasing interest in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. However, the unique characteristics of the semiconductor processes, such as nonlinearity in most batch processes, multimodal batch trajectories due to product mix, and process steps with variable durations, have posed some difficulties to the PCA-based methods. To explicitly account for these unique characteristics, a fault detection method using the k-nearest neighbor rule (FD-kNN) is developed in this paper. Because in fault detection faults are usually not identified and characterized beforehand, in this paper the traditional kNN algorithm is adapted such that only normal operation data is needed. Because the developed method makes use of the kNN rule, which is a nonlinear classifier, it naturally handles possible nonlinearity in the data. Also, because the FD-kNN method makes decisions based on small local neighborhoods of similar batches, it is well suited for multimodal cases. Another feature of the proposed FD-kNN method, which is essential for online fault detection, is that the data preprocessing is performed automatically without human intervention. These capabilities of the developed FD-kNN method are demonstrated by simulated illustrative examples as well as an industrial example.","1558-2345","","10.1109/TSM.2007.907607","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4369338","Fault detection;k-nearest neighbor rule;pattern recognition;semiconductor manufacturing;statistical process monitoring","Fault detection;Manufacturing processes;Semiconductor device manufacture;Semiconductor device testing;Process control;Principal component analysis;Manufacturing industries;Fault diagnosis;Data preprocessing;Humans","electronics industry;fault location;integrated circuit manufacture;principal component analysis","fault detection;k-nearest neighbor rule;semiconductor manufacturing process;statistical process;principal component analysis","","187","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A random target impulse response is used to model the scattering characteristics of the extended (nonpoint) target, and two radar waveform design problems with constraints on waveform power have been investigated. The first one is to design waveforms that maximize the conditional mutual information (MI) between the random target impulse response and the reflected waveforms given the knowledge of transmitted waveforms. The second one is to find transmitted waveforms that minimize the mean-square error (MSE) in estimating the target impulse response. Our analysis indicates that under the same total power constraint, these two criteria lead to the same solution for a matrix which specifies the essential part of the optimum waveform design. The solution employs water-filling to allocate the limited power appropriately.

First, to achieve high-bandwidth current control characteristics, an improved deadbeat current controller with delay compensation is adopted. The compensation method forces the delay elements, which are caused by voltage calculation, PWM, and synchronous frame rotation, to be equivalently placed outside the closed-loop control system. Hence, their effect on the closed-loop stability is eliminated, and the current controller can be designed with a higher bandwidth. Second, to relax the parameter sensitivity issue of the deadbeat controller and to realize a control scheme with reduced sensors, a novel adaptive self-tuning load model is emerged in the control structure. The adaptive model is designed with low computational demand to estimate in real time the load parameters (R,L) and the back-electromotive-force voltage simultaneously. A unified solution to the present nonlinear estimation problem is presented by adopting a parallel observer structure. Furthermore, the adaptive model has the necessary phase advance of the estimated quantities, which compensates for the total system's delay.

This problem is further complicated by the fact that in many cases, outliers have to be detected from data streams that arrive at an enormous pace. In this paper, an incremental LOF (local outlier factor) algorithm, appropriate for detecting outliers in data streams, is proposed. The proposed incremental LOF algorithm provides equivalent detection performance as the iterated static LOF algorithm (applied after insertion of each data record), while requiring significantly less computational time. In addition, the incremental LOF algorithm also dynamically updates the profiles of data points. This is a very important property, since data profiles may change over time. The paper provides theoretical evidence that insertion of a new data point as well as deletion of an old data point influence only limited number of their closest neighbors and thus the number of updates per such insertion/deletion does not depend on the total number of points TV in the data set. Our experiments performed on several simulated and real life data sets have demonstrated that the proposed incremental LOF algorithm is computationally efficient, while at the same time very successful in detecting outliers and changes of distributional behavior in various data stream applications","","1-4244-0705-2","10.1109/CIDM.2007.368917","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221341","","Event detection;Telecommunication traffic;Data mining;Change detection algorithms;Video surveillance;Computational Intelligence Society;Intrusion detection;Traffic control;Unsupervised learning;Computer networks","data handling","incremental local outlier detection;data streams;local outlier factor algorithm","","137","","42","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This architecture is a peer-to-peer (P2P) model based on multiple OSGi platforms, in which service-oriented mechanisms are used for system components to interact with one another, and MA technology is applied to augment the interaction mechanisms","1558-2442","","10.1109/TSMCC.2006.886997","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4106037","Agent-based system;mobile agent (MA);multi-agent system;Open Services Gateway Initiative (OSGi);smart home;service-oriented architecture (SOA)","Smart homes;Service oriented architecture;Computer architecture;Appropriate technology;Home appliances;Distributed computing;Home computing;Computer science;Chaos;Peer to peer computing","client-server systems;home automation;internetworking;mobile agents;network servers;peer-to-peer computing","service-oriented smart-home architecture;OSGi;mobile-agent technology;mobile devices;dynamic services;Open Services Gateway Initiative;peer-to-peer model","","126","","45","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the scheme proposed in this paper, it is possible to load these lines very close to their thermal limits. The conductors are allowed to carry usual ac along with dc superimposed on it. The added dc power flow does not cause any transient instability. This paper presents the feasibility of converting a double circuit ac line into composite ac-dc power transmission line to get the advantages of parallel ac-dc transmission to improve stability and damping out oscillations. Simulation and experimental studies are carried out for the coordinated control as well as independent control of ac and dc power transmissions. No alterations of conductors, insulator strings, and towers of the original line are needed. Substantial gain in the loadability of the line is obtained.

Algorithms for mining social networks have been developed in the past; however, most of them were designed primarily for networks containing only positive relations and, thus, are not suitable for signed networks. In this work, we propose a new algorithm, called FEC, to mine signed social networks where both positive within-group relations and negative between-group relations are dense. FEC considers both the sign and the density of relations as the clustering attributes, making it effective for not only signed networks but also conventional social networks including only positive relations. Also, FEC adopts an agent-based heuristic that makes the algorithm efficient (in linear time with respect to the size of a network) and capable of giving nearly optimal solutions. FEC depends on only one parameter whose value can easily be set and requires no prior knowledge on hidden community structures. The effectiveness and efficacy of FEC have been demonstrated through a set of rigorous experiments involving both benchmark and randomly generated signed networks.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2007.1061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4302742","community mining;agent-based approach;random walk;signed social networks","Social network services;Clustering algorithms;Polynomials;Algorithm design and analysis;Joining processes;Humans;Robustness","data mining;optimisation;random processes;social sciences computing;software agents","community mining;signed social networks;FEC;positive relations;agent-based heuristic;negative relations;random walk","","224","","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared to other mobile networks, VANET exhibits unique characteristics in terms of vehicular mobility constraints, application requirements such as a safety message broadcast period, and vehicular network connectivity. Based on the observed characteristics, we propose a scheme called AMOEBA, that provides location privacy by utilizing the group navigation of vehicles. By simulating vehicular mobility in freeways and streets, the performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated under VANET application constraints and two passive adversary models.

However, coils are widely used in biomedical applications as inductive links for both power and data, and the power transfer capacity and the data rate of inductive links are determined by the operating frequency of the coils. The maximum operating frequency is limited by the self-resonant frequency of the coil. We present here an analytical express for the optimal frequency of a coil in terms of the design parameters. By varying the design parameters, we can move the optimal frequency close to the operating frequency, thereby boosting the efficiency of the inductive link.

To learn a well-performed hypothesis, a large amount of diagnosed samples are required. Although the samples can be easily collected from routine medical examinations, it is usually impossible for medical experts to make a diagnosis for each of the collected samples. If a hypothesis could be learned in the presence of a large amount of undiagnosed samples, the heavy burden on the medical experts could be released. In this paper, a new semisupervised learning algorithm named Co-Forest is proposed. It extends the co-training paradigm by using a well-known ensemble method named Random Forest, which enables Co-Forest to estimate the labeling confidence of undiagnosed samples and easily produce the final hypothesis. Experiments on benchmark data sets verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Case studies on three medical data sets and a successful application to microcalcification detection for breast cancer diagnosis show that undiagnosed samples are helpful in building CAD systems, and Co-Forest is able to enhance the performance of the hypothesis that is learned on only a small amount of diagnosed samples by utilizing the available undiagnosed samples.","1558-2426","","10.1109/TSMCA.2007.904745","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4342802","Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD);co-training;ensemble learning;machine learning;microcalcification cluster detection;random forest;semisupervised learning","Computer aided diagnosis;Machine learning;Medical diagnostic imaging;Semisupervised learning;Breast cancer;Labeling;Cancer detection;Technological innovation;Supervised learning;Machine learning algorithms","cancer;gynaecology;learning (artificial intelligence);medical diagnostic computing;medical expert systems;pattern clustering;tumours","breast cancer diagnosis;microcalcification cluster detection;medical data sets;undiagnosed samples;random forest ensemble method;co-forest semi supervised learning algorithm;routine medical examination;medical expert system;machine learning technique;computer-aided diagnosis","","187","","47","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Liang","Inst. for Infocomm Res.; Inst. for Infocomm Res.","2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","","2007","","","27","32","In cognitive radio networks, the secondary users can use the frequency bands when the primary users are not present. Hence secondary users need to constantly sense the presence of the primary users. When the primary users are detected, the secondary users have to vacate that channel. This makes the probability of detection important to the primary users as it indicates their protection level from secondary users. When the secondary users detect the presence of a primary user which is in fact not there, it is referred to as false alarm. The probability of false alarm is important to the secondary users as it determines their usage of an unoccupied channel. Depending on whose interest is of priority, either a targeted probability of detection or false alarm shall be set. After setting one of the probabilities, the other can be optimized through cooperative sensing. In this paper, we show that cooperating all secondary users in the network does not necessary achieve the optimum performance, but instead, it is achieved by cooperating a certain number of users with the highest primary user's signal to noise ratio.

However, it can also achieve reactive-power compensation and mains-current balancing when required. The controller has a two-layer structure. The outer layer generates the current references for the inner layer. The former uses a plug-in discrete-time repetitive algorithm for current-harmonic compensation, a proportional-integral algorithm to maintain the dc-capacitor voltage in spite of unmodeled losses and a reactive-power-reference generator. The inner layer uses state-feedback with integral action for current control. The repetitive controller is justified to improve the tracking of the periodic current references required by the active filters. The stability of the resulting closed-loop system is studied and some indication of the system robustness is given.

Short term analysis of HRV features has been investigated mostly in ECG data from normal and cardiac patients. Thus, short term HRV features may not have any relevance on the assessment of acute mental stress.

"Feedforward Carrier Recovery for Coherent Optical Communications","E. Ip; J. M. Kahn","Stanford Univ., Stanford; Stanford Univ., Stanford","Journal of Lightwave Technology","","2007","25","9","2675","2692","We study a carrier-synchronization scheme for coherent optical communications that uses a feedforward architecture that can be implemented in digital hardware without a phase-locked loop. We derive the equations for maximum a posteriori joint detection of the transmitted symbols and the carrier phase. The result is a multidimensional optimization problem that we approximate with a two-stage iterative algorithm: The first stage is a symbol-by-symbol soft detector of the carrier phase, and the second stage is a hard-decision phase estimator that uses prior and subsequent soft-phase decisions to obtain a minimum mean-square-error phase estimate by exploiting the temporal correlation in the phase-noise process. The received symbols are then derotated by the hard-decision phase estimates, and maximum- likelihood sequence detection of the symbols follows. As each component in the carrier-recovery unit can be separately optimized, the resulting system is highly flexible. We show that the optimum hard-decision phase estimator is a linear filter whose impulse response consists of a causal and an anticausal exponential sequence, which we can truncate and implement as an finite-impulse- response filter. We derive equations for the phase-error variance and the system bit-error ratio (BER). Our results show that 4, 8, and 16 quadrature-amplitude-modulation (QAM) transmissions at 1 dB above sensitivity for BER = 10-3 is possible with laser beat linewidths of DeltanuTb = 1.3 X 10-4, 1.3 X 10-4, and 1.5 x 105 when a decision-directed soft-decision phase estimator is employed.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2007.902118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4298982","Carrier synchronization;coherent detection;digital signal processing;feedforward;optical communications;phase locked loop","Optical fiber communication;Phase estimation;Phase detection;Equations;Nonlinear filters;Bit error rate;Hardware;Phase locked loops;Multidimensional systems;Iterative algorithms","error statistics;FIR filters;iterative methods;least mean squares methods;maximum likelihood sequence estimation;optical communication;phase estimation","feedforward carrier recovery;coherent optical communications;carrier-synchronization scheme;maximum a posteriori joint detection;multidimensional optimization problem;two-stage iterative algorithm;symbol-by-symbol soft detector;hard-decision phase estimator;minimum mean-square-error phase estimation;phase-noise process;maximum-likelihood sequence detection;linear filter;impulse response;finite-impulse-response filter;bit-error ratio;BER;quadrature-amplitude-modulation;QAM transmissions;decision-directed soft-decision phase estimator","","211","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thanks to the rotor anisotropy, the corresponding high-frequency current is modulated and used to determine the rotor position. Two techniques are considered: the first one adopts a pulsating voltage vector in the estimated synchronous reference frame, while the second one adopts a rotating voltage vector. These techniques are effective at zero and at low motor speed. The accuracy of the rotor position detection depends strictly on the rotor saliency, that is, on the geometry of the PM rotor. In fact both saturation and d-and q-axis cross-coupling have a heavy influence on the correct rotor position detection. The aim of this paper is to compare the two sensorless control techniques, together with two rotor geometries, that is, IPM and inset rotor. In order to highlight the effectiveness of the sensorless technique, the tests are carried out at various operating conditions. It is found that the effectiveness of the sensorless rotor position detection strongly depends on the PM rotor geometry. Conversely, the choice of the sensorless control technique affects slightly the rotor position detection.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2007.904238","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359243","High-frequency signal injection;interior permanent magnet (PM) motor;low-speed sensorless control;motor design optimization;zero-speed sensorless control;High-frequency signal injection;interior permanent magnet (PM) motor;low-speed sensorless control;motor design optimization;zero-speed sensorless control","Sensorless control;Rotors;Synchronous motors;Stators;Geometry;Permanent magnet motors;Testing;Saturation magnetization;Voltage control;Anisotropic magnetoresistance","permanent magnet motors;rotors;stators;synchronous motors","PM motor structures;sensorless control technique;zero speed rotor;position detection;synchronous permanent magnet motor;high frequency stator voltage;rotor anisotropy","","120","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents a novel framework for combining all the three i.e. color, texture and shape information, and achieve higher retrieval efficiency. The image is partitioned into non- overlapping tiles of equal size. The color moments and moments on Gabor filter responses of these tiles serve as local descriptors of color and texture respectively. This local information is captured for two resolutions and two grid layouts that provide different details of the same image. An integrated matching scheme, based on most similar highest priority (MSHP) principle and the adjacency matrix of a bipartite graph formed using the tiles of query and target image, is provided for matching the images. Shape information is captured in terms of edge images computed using gradient vector flow fields. Invariant moments are then used to record the shape features. The combination of the color, texture and shape features provide a robust feature set for image retrieval.

A focus of recent research activities in cooperative communications is to achieve spatial diversity gains by requiring these neighboring stations to retransmit the overheard information to the final destination. In this paper we demonstrate that such cooperation among stations in a wireless LAN (WLAN) can achieve both higher throughput and lower interference. We present the design for a medium access control protocol called CoopMAC, in which high data rate stations assist low data rate stations in their transmission by forwarding their traffic. In our proposed protocol, using the overheard transmissions, each low data rate node maintains a table, called a CoopTable, of potential helper nodes that can assist in its transmissions. During transmission, each low data rate node selects either direct transmission or transmission through a helper node in order to minimize the total transmission time. Using analysis, simulation and testbed experimentation, we quantify the increase in the total network throughput, and the reduction in delay, if such cooperative transmissions are utilized. The CoopMAC protocol is simple and backward compatible with the legacy 802.11 system. In this paper, we also demonstrate a reduction in the signal-to-interference ratio in a dense deployment of 802.11 access points, which in some cases is a more important consequence of cooperation","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2007.070210","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4107953","","Wireless LAN;Throughput;Access protocols;Bit rate;Fading;Interference;Media Access Protocol;Analytical models;Wireless networks;MIMO","access protocols;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","CoopMAC;cooperative medium access control protocol;wireless LAN;network traffic;802.11 access point","","480","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thereby, it cancels the effects of the phase noise beyond the standard common phase error correction used in contemporary OFDM standards. The algorithm requires that the correlation properties of the intercarrier interference are known. We calculate these properties in terms of the phase-noise spectral correlation matrix for both Wiener and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck phase-noise models, respectively. This modeling corresponds to a free-running oscillator, as well as a phase-locked loop realization of the local oscillator in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing transceivers. For both transceiver configurations, we investigate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Unfortunately, switches of four and upward in these transformer-based schemes increase production costs and reduce conversion efficiency. In this study, a coupled-inductor bidirectional converter scheme utilizes only three power switches to fulfill the objective of bidirectional current control. The high step-up and step-down ratios enable a battery module with a low voltage to be injected into a high-voltage dc bus for subsequent utilization. Some experimental results are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed bidirectional converter. Since the techniques of voltage clamping, synchronous rectification and soft switching are exploited in this circuit topology, and the corresponding device specifications are adequately fulfilled, it can provide high-efficiency bidirectional power conversion for power sources with large voltage diversity.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2007.904167","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4300907","Bidirectional converter;coupled inductor;soft switching;synchronous rectification;voltage clamping","Switching converters;Circuit topology;Zero current switching;Zero voltage switching;Switching loss;Switches;Production;Costs;Coupling circuits;Current control","inductors;power convertors;switching convertors","high efficiency bidirectional converter;power sources;voltage diversity;soft switching techniques;zero voltage switching;zero current switching;voltage clamping;synchronous rectification;ZVS;ZCS;coupled-inductor bidirectional converter scheme;bidirectional current control","","75","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we show that formulating the problem in a Naive Bayesian classification framework makes such preprocessing unnecessary and produces an algorithm that is simple, efficient, and robust. Furthermore, it scales well to handle large number of classes. To recognize the patches surrounding keypoints, our classifier uses hundreds of simple binary features and models class posterior probabilities. We make the problem computationally tractable by assuming independence between arbitrary sets of features. Even though this is not strictly true, we demonstrate that our classifier nevertheless performs remarkably well on image datasets containing very significant perspective changes.","1063-6919","1-4244-1179-3","10.1109/CVPR.2007.383123","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4270148","","Object detection;Robustness;Computer vision;Bayesian methods;Image recognition;Testing;Image retrieval;Laboratories;Image registration;Casting","image classification;image recognition;probability","keypoint recognition;ten lines;object detection;patch preprocessing;perspective distortion;Naive Bayesian classification framework;class posterior probabilities;image datasets;code","","223","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The huge amount of data and vast number of different protocols in the Internet seems ideal as a high-bandwidth vehicle for covert communication. This article is a survey of the existing techniques for creating covert channels in widely deployed network and application protocols.

Eng., Tel-Aviv Univ.; NA","IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","","2007","11","2","190","202","This paper presents an image representation and matching framework for image categorization in medical image archives. Categorization enables one to determine automatically, based on the image content, the examined body region and imaging modality. It is a basic step in content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems, the goal of which is to augment text-based search with visual information analysis. CBIR systems are currently being integrated with picture archiving and communication systems for increasing the overall search capabilities and tools available to radiologists. The proposed methodology is comprised of a continuous and probabilistic image representation scheme using Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM) along with information-theoretic image matching via the Kullback-Leibler (KL) measure. The GMM-KL framework is used for matching and categorizing X-ray images by body regions. A multidimensional feature space is used to represent the image input, including intensity, texture, and spatial information. Unsupervised clustering via the GMM is used to extract coherent regions in feature space that are then used in the matching process. A dominant characteristic of the radiological images is their poor contrast and large intensity variations. This presents a challenge to matching among the images, and is handled via an illumination-invariant representation. The GMM-KL framework is evaluated for image categorization and image retrieval on a dataset of 1500 radiological images. A classification rate of 97.5% was achieved. The classification results compare favorably with reported global and local representation schemes. Precision versus recall curves indicate a strong retrieval result as compared with other state-of-the-art retrieval techniques. Finally, category models are learned and results are presented for comparing images to learned category models","1558-0032","","10.1109/TITB.2006.874191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4118179","Content-based image retrieval (CBIR);image matching;medical content retrieval;medical image categorization;picture archiving and communication systems (PACS);statistical medical image modeling;X-ray image analysis","Biomedical imaging;Image retrieval;Picture archiving and communication systems;Image representation;Body regions;Information retrieval;Content based retrieval;Information analysis;Image matching;X-ray imaging","content-based retrieval;diagnostic radiography;feature extraction;image classification;image matching;image representation;image retrieval;image segmentation;image texture;medical image processing;PACS;statistical analysis","medical image categorization;content-based image retrieval system;PACS;GMM-KL framework;image representation;medical image archives;image content;imaging modality;text-based search;visual information analysis;picture archiving and communication systems;Gaussian mixture modeling;information-theoretic image matching;Kullback-Leibler measure;X-ray images;multidimensional feature space;image intensity;image texture;spatial information;unsupervised clustering;feature extraction;radiological images;illumination-invariant representation;image classification;global representation schemes;local representation schemes;statistical medical image modeling;X-ray image analysis","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Database Management Systems;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Radiology Information Systems;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique;User-Computer Interface","114","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There are many possible inverter topologies and inverter switching schemes and each one will have its own relative advantages and disadvantages. Efficiency and output current distortion are two important factors governing the choice of inverter system. In this paper, it is argued that current controlled inverters offer significant advantages from the point of view of minimisation of current distortion. Two inverter switching strategies are explored in detail. These are the unipolar current controlled inverter and the bipolar current controlled inverter. With respect to low frequency distortion, previously published works provide theoretical arguments in favour of bipolar switching. On the other hand it has also been argued that the unipolar switched inverter offers reduced switching losses and generates less EMI. On efficiency grounds, it appears that the unipolar switched inverter has an advantage. However, experimental results presented in this paper show that the level of low frequency current distortion in the unipolar switched inverter is such that it can only comply with Australian Standard 4777.2 above a minimum output current. On the other hand it is shown that at the same current levels bipolar switching results in reduced low frequency harmonics.","","978-0-646-49488-3","10.1109/AUPEC.2007.4548098","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4548098","","Inverters;Voltage control;Frequency;Signal processing;Hysteresis;Australia;Insulation life;Power harmonic filters;Photovoltaic systems;Switching loss","electric current control;invertors;power grids;solar cells;switching convertors","single phase grid-connected inverter;photovoltaic panel;switching scheme;current controlled inverter;AC network;Australian 4777.2 standard","","10","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This strategy overcomes one of the main problems of this converter, which is the low-frequency voltage oscillation that appears in the neutral point under some operating conditions. The proposed modulation strategy can completely remove this oscillation for all the operating points and for any kind of loads, even unbalanced and nonlinear loads. The algorithm is based on a carrier-based pulsewidth modulation. Nevertheless, it can generate the maximum output-voltage amplitudes that are attainable under linear modulation, such as space-vector modulation. Furthermore, this technique can be implemented with a very simple algorithm and, hence, can be processed very quickly. The only drawback of this strategy is that the switching frequencies of the devices are one third higher than those of standard sinusoidal pulsewidth modulation. A control loop for balancing the voltages on the dc-link capacitors is also proposed. This balancing strategy is designed, so that it does not further increase the switching frequencies of the devices when it is applied to the converter. The proposed modulation technique is verified by simulation and experiment.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2007.894788","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4278027","Modulation strategy;neutral-point-clamped (NPC) converter;pulsewidth-modulated inverters;three-level converter;voltage balance","Capacitors;Switching frequency;Voltage control;Space vector pulse width modulation;Pulse modulation;Amplitude modulation;Topology;Switching converters;Pulse inverters;Industrial Electronics Society","PWM power convertors;voltage control","neutral-point-clamped converter;low-frequency voltage oscillation elimination;carrier-based pulsewidth modulation;linear modulation;space-vector modulation;dc-link capacitors;voltages balancing strategy","","161","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While the solar radiation process (and, hence, the energy generation process in a solar cell) is modeled by a stochastic process (i.e., a Markov chain), a linear battery model with relaxation effect is used to model the battery capacity recovery process. Developed based on a multidimensional discrete-time Markov chain, the presented model is used to analyze the performances of different sleep and wakeup strategies in a sensor/mesh node. The packet dropping and packet blocking probabilities at a node are the major performance metrics. The numerical results obtained from the analytical model are validated by extensive simulations. In addition, using the queuing model, based on a game-theoretic formulation, we demonstrate how to obtain the optimal parameters for a particular sleep and wakeup strategy. In this case, we formulate a bargaining game by exploiting the trade-off between packet blocking and packet dropping probabilities due to the sleep and wakeup dynamics in a sensor/mesh node. The Nash solution is obtained for the equilibrium point of sleep and wakeup probabilities.

The results presented in this article can be divided in two groups: top-down approaches, whereby formal logic tools are employed on rather abstract models of robots; and bottom up approaches, whose aim is to provide means by which such abstractions are possible and effective.

Nanoscale EMs (nEMs) particularly offer the promise of much higher energy densities, faster rate of energy release, greater stability, and more security (sensitivity to unwanted initiation). nEMs could therefore give response to microenergetics challenges. This paper provides a comprehensive review of current research activities in nEMs for microenergetics application. While thermodynamic calculations of flame temperature and reaction enthalpies are tools to choose desirable EMs, they are not sufficient for the choice of good material for microscale application where thermal losses are very penalizing. A strategy to select nEM is therefore proposed based on an analysis of the material diffusivity and heat of reaction. Finally, after a description of the different nEMs synthesis approaches, some guidelines for future investigations are provided.","1941-0158","","10.1109/JMEMS.2007.893519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4285648","Materials processing;materials science and technology;microelectromechanical devices;microelectromechanical system (MEMS);micropyrotechnics;nanoscale energetic materials (nEMs);propulsion;synthesis;thermal power generation","Nanostructured materials;Micromechanical devices;Nanoelectromechanical systems;Propulsion;Stability;Power system security;Thermodynamics;Fires;Temperature sensors;Guidelines","micromechanical devices;nanostructured materials;reviews","nanoenergetic materials;MEMS;microelectromechanical system;nanoscale energetic material;microscale energy-demanding systems;microenergetics application;material diffusivity analysis","","291","","81","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The assessment was done by evaluating the fuel consumption using three optimal controllers, each with a different level of information access to the driven route. The lowest information case represents that the vehicle knows that it is being driven in a certain environment, e.g., city driving, and that the controller has been optimized for that type of environment. The second highest information level represents a vehicle equipped with a GPS combined with a traffic-flow information system. In the highest information level, the future power demand is completely known to the control system, hence, the corresponding optimal controller results in the minimal attainable fuel consumption. This paper showed that good performance (1%-3% from the minimal attainable fuel consumption) can be achieved with the lowest information case, with a time-invariant controller that is optimized to the environment. The second highest information level results in less than 0.2% higher consumption than the minimal attainable on the studied route. This means that it is possible to design a predictive controller based on information supplied by the vehicle-navigation system and traffic-flow-information systems that can come very close to the minimal attainable fuel consumption. A novel algorithm that uses information supplied by the vehicle-navigation system was presented.

The integrated electricity-gas optimal power flow problem is solved using an hybrid approach which combines evolutionary strategy algorithm with Newton's and Interior point method. It hybrid approach fully takes the advantages of both evolutionary strategy optimization and classical methods (such as Newton's and interior point method) which the former is able to jump out of the local optimal point and the latter boats the local exploration ability within the neighborhood of the optimal.

However, by investigating the organization and behavior of the communication subsystem in WSN devices, we found that in terms of energy consumption, the actual specifications of real WSN devices are significantly different from those typically assumed while designing and evaluating the energy-aware protocols. We argue that the fundamental energy consumption behavior of real WSN devices is critically important to properly model before optimizing or developing an energy-aware design even at higher communication layers. Thus, we initially propose a general energy consumption model of WSN devices based on their actual hardware architecture. In particular, we utilize measured energy consumption performance of the actual hardware components to implement a realistic CSESM (communication subsystem energy consumption model) of WSN devices, which reflects the energy consumption in various functioning states and during transitions between states of the devices. By applying the CSECM, we are able to evaluate and analyze the energy efficiency of various WSN sleeping schedule protocols. Experimental measurements with real WSN devices (CC1000 and CC2420) validated the CSECM and its application methodology. Furthermore, using realistic CSECM parameter from real WSN devices has significant impact on the evaluation of energy efficient WSN sleeping schedule protocols and in developing effective power management schemes.","2155-5494","1-4244-1268-4","10.1109/SAHCN.2007.4292826","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4292826","","Energy consumption;Energy management;Wireless sensor networks;Protocols;Hardware;Energy efficiency;Scheduling;Design optimization;Energy measurement;Particle measurements","protocols;wireless sensor networks","energy consumption model;power management;wireless sensor networks;WSN;power management scheme;energy-aware protocols;CSESM;communication subsystem energy consumption model;hardware components","","53","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nothing can be further from the truth. When I entered the field in the '50s I thought the same thing. The MIT Radiation Lab. Series 28 book volume set summarizing the highly classified World War II work on radar was just published and provided the definitive coverage and there was to be nothing more to learn. How wrong I was. Since then many amazing new developments have taken place. Things are moving even faster now. We live in exciting times. Phased array radars and radars have seen in recent years breakthroughs that lead to capabilities not possible only a few years ago. This is exemplified by the development of GaAs integrated microwave circuits called monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMIC) which makes it possible to build active electronically scanned arrays (AESAs) having lighter weight, smaller volume, higher reliability and lower cost. MMIC allows the construction of AESAs for applications not feasible before. This integration has reached the point where it is possible to now build a low cost 35 GHz phased array for a missile seeker costing $40/element (total cost of array including all electronics divided by number of elements). The advances provided by Moore's Law has now made it is feasible to do digital beam forming with all its numerous advantages. One advantage of digital beamforming is the ability to lower the search power and occupancy by up to a factor of two. Another advantage is that it makes it possible to achieve the performance of a fully adaptive array without having to do a large matrix inversion, i.e., it makes adaptive-adaptive array processing or equivalently principal decomposition feasible. Also covered will be: the potential for GaN and SiC chips which have the capability of a factor of ten higher peak power than GaAs chips; arrays with instantaneous bandwidths of up to 33:1; SiGe low cost T/R modules; low cost MEMS arrays; metamaterials which provide negative refractivity possibly allowing focusing beyond the diffraction limit; a real radar application for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) as opposed to fantasy has been demonstrated by Lincoln Laboratory MIT which allows the coherent combining of two radars to achieve a 9 dB increase in sensitivity; the ability to build microwave tubes that are smaller, more power efficient, lighter, require lower voltages and have lower cost.","2375-5318","1-4244-0283-2","10.1109/RADAR.2007.374187","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4250281","Radar;active-phased arrays;MMIC;MEMS;T/R nodule;phased array;AESA;electronic scanning;GaAs;GaN;SiC;SiGe;CMOS;digital beam forming;adaptive arrays;sidelobe canceler;Ultra-Wideband Antenna;metamaterials;VED;tube;Vacuum Electron Device;gyroklystron;gyrotwystron;magnetron;klystron;traveling wave tube;TWT;microwave power modules;MPM;power amplifier module (PAM);SBX;GBR-P","Phased arrays;Costs;MMICs;Microwave antenna arrays;Optical arrays;Gallium arsenide;Array signal processing;Radar applications;MIMO;Books","gallium compounds;metamaterials;micromechanical devices;MIMO systems;MMIC;phased array radar;silicon compounds","phased-array radar;GaAs integrated microwave circuits;monolithic microwave integrated circuits;MMIC;active electronically scanned arrays;AESA;Moore Law;digital beam forming;MEMS;metamaterials;negative refractivity;multiple-input multiple-output;GaN;SiC","","22","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sodini","Broadcom Corp., San Diego; NA","IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","","2007","42","8","1710","1722","A wideband software-defined digital-RF modulator targeting Gb/s data rates is presented. The modulator consists of a 2.625-GS/s digital DeltaSigma modulator, a 5.25-GHz direct digital-RF converter, and a fourth-order auto-tuned passive LC RF bandpass filter. The architecture removes high dynamic range analog circuits from the baseband signal path, replacing them with high-speed digital circuits to take advantage of digital CMOS scaling. The integration of the digital-RF converter with an RF bandpass reconstruction filter eliminates spurious signals and noise associated with direct digital-RF conversion. An efficient passgate adder circuit lowers the power consumption of the high-speed digital processing and a quadrature digital-IF approach is employed to reduce LO feedthrough and image spurs. The digital-RF modulator is software programmable to support variable bandwidths, adaptive modulation schemes, and multi-channel operation within a frequency band.

"A Practical, Accurate and Very General Core Loss Model for Nonsinusoidal Waveforms","W. A. Roshen","Ohio State Univ., Columbus, OH","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","","2007","22","1","30","40","Nonsinusoidal voltage waveforms are quite common in high frequency power conversion magnetics. Low frequency nonsinusoidal waveforms are also common in ac motor applications with waveforms such as pulsewidth modulation and six-step. Previous attempts to model these losses, based on the Steinmetz equation, can work only in a limited range of frequencies, flux density excitations, and waveforms. In this paper, we present a very practical, yet very general and accurate model, for core loss calculations in case of nonsinusoidal voltage waveforms. We show the model is equally applicable to low and high frequencies, metallic as well as nonmetallic (e.g., ferrites) core materials, by comparing the model prediction with measured data for various waveforms, frequencies, and flux densities. The model can be used for the design of high frequency transformers and inductors for use in switched mode power supplies. The model can also be used for ac motors where it is hard to estimate ""derating factor"" and to avoid uncontrolled temperature rise","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2006.886608","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4052433","Pulsewidth modulation (PWM)","Core loss;AC motors;Predictive models;Switched-mode power supply;Voltage;Frequency conversion;Power conversion;Magnetics;Space vector pulse width modulation;Pulse modulation","AC motors;high-frequency transformers;losses;magnetic cores;power inductors;PWM power convertors;switched mode power supplies","core loss model;nonsinusoidal voltage waveforms;high frequency power conversion magnetics;ac motor applications;pulsewidth modulation;Steinmetz equation;flux density excitations;nonmetallic core materials;high frequency transformers;inductors;switched mode power supplies;derating factor estimation","","138","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For this purpose, our approach includes an ontology-based scheme for the semiautomatic annotation of documents and a retrieval system. The retrieval model is based on an adaptation of the classic vector-space model, including an annotation weighting algorithm, and a ranking algorithm.

To address this problem, we present NodeTrix, a hybrid representation for networks that combines the advantages of two traditional representations: node-link diagrams are used to show the global structure of a network, while arbitrary portions of the network can be shown as adjacency matrices to better support the analysis of communities. A key contribution is a set of interaction techniques. These allow analysts to create a NodeTrix visualization by dragging selections to and from node-link and matrix forms, and to flexibly manipulate the NodeTrix representation to explore the dataset and create meaningful summary visualizations of their findings.

Despite the near-optimal decorrelation and energy compaction properties, application of the SA-DCT has been rather limited, targeted nearly exclusively to video compression. In this paper, we present a novel approach to image filtering based on the SA-DCT. We use the SA-DCT in conjunction with the Anisotropic Local Polynomial Approximation-Intersection of Confidence Intervals technique, which defines the shape of the transform's support in a pointwise adaptive manner. The thresholded or attenuated SA-DCT coefficients are used to reconstruct a local estimate of the signal within the adaptive-shape support. Since supports corresponding to different points are in general overlapping, the local estimates are averaged together using adaptive weights that depend on the region's statistics. This approach can be used for various image-processing tasks. In this paper, we consider, in particular, image denoising and image deblocking and deringing from block-DCT compression. A special structural constraint in luminance-chrominance space is also proposed to enable an accurate filtering of color images. Simulation experiments show a state-of-the-art quality of the final estimate, both in terms of objective criteria and visual appearance. Thanks to the adaptive support, reconstructed edges are clean, and no unpleasant ringing artifacts are introduced by the fitted transform","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2007.891788","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4154791","Anisotropic;deblocking;denoising;deringing;discrete cosine transform (DCT);shape adaptive","Discrete cosine transforms;Noise reduction;Gray-scale;Color;Shape;Filtering;Image reconstruction;Discrete transforms;Computational complexity;Decorrelation","computational complexity;decorrelation;discrete cosine transforms;filtering theory;image colour analysis;image denoising;image reconstruction;matrix algebra;polynomial approximation","pointwise shape-adaptive DCT;high-quality image denoising;image deblocking;grayscale image;color image;shape-adaptive discrete cosine transform;computational complexity;near-optimal decorrelation;energy compaction properties;image filtering;anisotropic local polynomial approximation;confidence interval intersection technique;image deringing;block-DCT compression;luminance-chrominance space","Algorithms;Artifacts;Artificial Intelligence;Color;Colorimetry;Computer Graphics;Fourier Analysis;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","354","","56","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

QKD systems and similar protocols use classical error-correcting codes for both error correction (for the honest parties to correct errors) and privacy amplification (to make an eavesdropper fully ignorant). From a coding perspective, a good model that corresponds to such a setting is the wire tap channel introduced by Wyner in 1975. In this correspondence, we study fundamental limits and coding methods for wire tap channels. We provide an alternative view of the proof for secrecy capacity of wire tap channels and show how capacity achieving codes can be used to achieve the secrecy capacity for any wiretap channel. We also consider binary erasure channel and binary symmetric channel special cases for the wiretap channel and propose specific practical codes. In some cases our designs achieve the secrecy capacity and in others the codes provide security at rates below secrecy capacity.

Eng., Oklahoma Univ., Norman, OK; NA","IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","","2007","55","1","120","133","The adaptive nonlinear predistorter is an effective technique to compensate for the nonlinear distortion existing in digital communication and control systems. However, available adaptive nonlinear predistorters using indirect learning are sensitive to measurement noise and do not perform optimally. Other available types are either slow to converge, complicated in structure and computationally expensive, or do not consider the memory effects in nonlinear systems such as a high power amplifier (HPA). In this paper, we first propose several novel adaptive nonlinear predistorters based on direct learning algorithms - the nonlinear filtered-x RLS (NFXRLS) algorithm, the nonlinear adjoint LMS (NALMS) algorithm, and the nonlinear adjoint RLS (NARLS) algorithm. Using these new learning algorithms, we design adaptive nonlinear predistorters for an HPA with memory effects or for an HPA following a linear system. Because of the direct learning algorithm, these novel adaptive predistorters outperform nonlinear predistorters that are based on the indirect learning method in the sense of normalized mean square error (NMSE), bit error rate (BER), and spectral regrowth. Moreover, our developed adaptive nonlinear predistorters are computationally efficient and/or converge rapidly when compared to other adaptive nonlinear predistorters that use direct learning, and furthermore can be easily implemented. We further simplify our proposed algorithms by exploring the robustness of our proposed algorithm as well as by examining the statistical properties of what we call the ""instantaneous equivalent linear"" (IEL) filter.

This paper gives detailed explanation on the reasons for the behavior of the LNA under extreme conditions, as well as on the results of the post-layout simulations as opposed to the pre-layout simulations, which are normally absent in most of the papers describing analog designs. In this work, the LNA was designed in Silterra 0.18-mum 6-metal 1-poly RFMOS process technology. The corner conditions were provided by Silterra in its models library. The post-layout simulations were conducted using Calibre. The transistorspsila size in the LNA were designed using power constrained noise optimization method and the width found to be 290 mum. On-chip inductors with Q of 8 were utilized to resonate with the metal-insulator-metal capacitors (mimcap). The input was 50 Omega matched using the transistor as well as an inductor at the input and three 1.65 nH inductors connected in parallel to provide a 0.55 nH inductance at the source of the CS transistor. The LNA consumed 3.8 mA of current at a supply voltage of 1.8 V. In this work, the resistance-parasitic capacitors-coupling capacitors (RCC) had been included in the post-layout simulations performed. RCC would reflect the performance of the LNA more realistically as it includes resistive and capacitive parasitics practically existing along and between the metals and substrate. The results in this paper show that the post-layout is able to closely represent the performance of the measured LNA in majority of its simulations as compared to the pre-layout simulations. This is because the post-layout simulation includes the parasitic effects of the substrate. In conjunction with this, simulations performed on the LNA under various corner conditions provide indications on what may happen in the ldquoreal worldrdquo. 10 corner conditions were imposed on the design, with variations in the device, resistors and capacitors parameters. WNWP with maximum resistance and minimum capacitance condition gave the worst gain performance and, hence, was chosen as the condition for running the noise and s-parameters simulations on the LNA. It is also shown in this paper that the absence of a large capacitor to isolate VDD from ground could prevent the LNA from behaving like an amplifier.","","978-1-4244-1355-3","10.1109/ICIAS.2007.4658597","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4658597","Inductively-degenerated;common-source cascode LNA;post-layout;corner conditions","Transistors;Capacitors;Integrated circuit modeling;Inductors;Gain;Frequency measurement;Resistors","code division multiple access;low noise amplifiers","single-ended inductively-degenerated common-source cascode LNA;post-layout corner conditions;WCDMA;resistance-parasitic capacitors-coupling capacitors;amplifier;frequency 2.14 GHz;frequency 2.11 GHz to 2.17 GHz","","5","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A BbNN consists of a 2-D array of modular component NNs with flexible structures and internal configurations that can be implemented using reconfigurable digital hardware such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Signal flow between the blocks determines the internal configuration of a block as well as the overall structure of the BbNN. Network structure and the weights are optimized using local gradient-based search and evolutionary operators with the rates changing adaptively according to their effectiveness in the previous evolution period. Such adaptive operator rate update scheme ensures higher fitness on average compared to predetermined fixed operator rates. The Hermite transform coefficients and the time interval between two neighboring R-peaks of ECG signals are used as inputs to the BbNN. A BbNN optimized with the proposed evolutionary algorithm (EA) makes a personalized heartbeat pattern classifier that copes with changing operating environments caused by individual difference and time-varying characteristics of ECG signals.

To ensure system reliability, the forecasting uncertainty must be considered in the incorporation of wind power capacity into generation planning.

Despite their effectiveness in achieving voltage buck-boost conversion, existing three-level Z-source inverters use two LC impedance networks and two isolated dc sources, which can significantly increase the overall system cost and require a more complex modulator for balancing the network inductive voltage boosting. Offering a number of less costly alternatives, this letter presents the design and control of two three-level Z-source inverters, whose output voltage can be stepped down or up using only a single LC impedance network connected between the dc input source and either a neutral-point-clamped (NPC) or dc-link cascaded inverter circuitry. Through careful design of their modulation scheme, both inverters can function with the minimum of six device commutations per half carrier cycle (similar to that needed by a traditional buck three-level NPC inverter), while producing the correct volt-sec average and inductive voltage boosting at their ac output terminals. Physically, the designed modulation scheme can conveniently be implemented using a generic ""alternative phase opposition disposition"" carrier-based modulator with the appropriate triplen offset and time advance/delay added.

This is done through an investigation of the effect of four different matching methodologies on the gain of radio frequency CMOS LNAs by means of compact analytical expressions. It is demonstrated that methods that convert the MOSFET's input impedance to 50 Omega for power matching are more suitable for low-power applications than methods that create a real 50-Omega resistance at the input of the LNA, such as source inductive degeneration. As it is analytically shown, this is because the former methods enhance the gain of the LNA by a factor that is inversely proportional to MOSFET's input resistance. The impact of each matching methodology on the noise figure (NF) of the LNA is also discussed in detail and design guidelines for optimum gain-NF performance are developed using analytical models of MOSFET's noise parameters. It is demonstrated that all four methods could achieve very good NF values, provided that the size of active and passive components are chosen carefully based on the given guidelines. Measured results of two monolithic 5.7-GHz LNAs, designed and fabricated in a 0.18-mum CMOS technology, are also presented. The input matching networks of these LNAs are optimized for low-power operation based on the theory presented in this paper. It is experimentally shown that this optimization results in approximately 60% reduction in the dc power consumption and up to 300% improvement in the overall performance of the LNA when compared with some of the most recently published LNAs","1558-0806","","10.1109/TCSI.2006.887622","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4126784","CMOS;low-noise amplifier (LNA);noise matching;radio frequency (RF)","Impedance matching;Radio frequency;CMOS technology;Inductors;Low-noise amplifiers;Noise figure;Noise measurement;Guidelines;Energy consumption;Reflector antennas","CMOS integrated circuits;impedance matching;low noise amplifiers;low-power electronics;radiofrequency amplifiers","input matching network;RF CMOS LNA;radio frequency CMOS low-noise amplifiers;MOSFET input impedance;MOSFET input resistance;noise figure;MOSFET noise parameters;active components;passive components;CMOS technology;5.7 GHz;50 ohm;0.18 micron","","44","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Group, Saskatchewan Univ., Saskatoon, Sask.; NA","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","","2007","22","1","34","41","The reliability impacts of a highly variable energy source such as wind power is an important aspect that needs to be assessed as wind power penetration becomes increasingly significant. Bulk electric system (BES) reliability analysis associated with wind energy conversion systems (WECS) provides an opportunity to investigate the reliability benefits at potential BES connection points in close proximity to the wind power development area. A bulk electric system can encounter transmission capacity limitation problems when a large-scale WECS is connected to a weak transmission area. In this case, transmission reinforcement may be required in order to increase the system capability to absorb more wind power at specified locations. BES reliability analysis associated with large-scale wind farms as demonstrated in this paper can assist system planners to create potential transmission reinforcement schemes to facilitate large-scale WECS additions to a bulk system. Reliability cost/worth analysis is also incorporated in the examination of reinforcement alternatives. A sequential Monte Carlo simulation approach is used as this methodology can facilitate a time series modeling of wind speeds and also provides accurate frequency and duration assessments.

The two microstrip open-circuited stubs, which are about a quarter-wavelength long at the center frequency, can function as two resonators with associated coupling arrangement to the CPW. This forms a very compact three-pole filter. The proposed filter also exhibits a quasi-elliptic function response, with one finite-frequency transmission zero closer to each side of the passband. Thus, a high selectivity is achieved using a small number of resonators, which leads to low insertion loss and group delay across the passband. The performance is predicated using EM simulations and verified experimentally.

We then minimize an estimate of the mean square error between the clean image and the denoised one. The key point is that we have at our disposal a very accurate, statistically unbiased, MSE estimate-Stein's unbiased risk estimate-that depends on the noisy image alone, not on the clean one. Like the MSE, this estimate is quadratic in the unknown weights, and its minimization amounts to solving a linear system of equations. The existence of this a priori estimate makes it unnecessary to devise a specific statistical model for the wavelet coefficients. Instead, and contrary to the custom in the literature, these coefficients are not considered random any more. We describe an interscale orthonormal wavelet thresholding algorithm based on this new approach and show its near-optimal performance-both regarding quality and CPU requirement-by comparing it with the results of three state-of-the-art nonredundant denoising algorithms on a large set of test images. An interesting fallout of this study is the development of a new, group-delay-based, parent-child prediction in a wavelet dyadic tree","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2007.891064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4099398","Image denoising;interscale dependencies;ortho normal wavelet transform;Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE) minimization","Image denoising;Wavelet coefficients;Noise reduction;Wavelet domain;Minimax techniques;Wavelet transforms;Biomedical imaging;Mean square error methods;Linear systems;Equations","image denoising;mean square error methods;statistical analysis;wavelet transforms","SURE approach;image denoising;interscale orthonormal wavelet thresholding algorithm;statistical model;wavelet coefficients;elementary nonlinear processes;mean square error estimation;Stein unbiased risk estimation;linear equation system;a priori estimate;state-of-the-art nonredundant denoising algorithm;group-delay-based parent-child prediction;wavelet dyadic tree","Algorithms;Artifacts;Artificial Intelligence;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","386","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The scaling laws for this laser design show that the power limit for CW operation is far beyond 40 kW for one single disk and the energy limit is higher than 3 J from one disk in pulsed operation. Also, the applicability of the thin-disk laser concept to optically pumped semiconductor structures will be discussed. When pumping directly into the quantum wells, the energy defect between the pump photon and the laser photon can be smaller than 5%, thus reducing the waste heat generated inside the semiconductor structure.

The proposed design is particularly useful at millimeter-wave frequencies where reduced physical dimensions make a circuit configuration suitable for low-cost package-level implementation difficult using traditional methods. Two frequency bands are demonstrated. At V-band, the circuit gives 0.3-dB excess insertion loss, 19-dB isolation, and 50% bandwidth.

The underlying idea is to provide a robust and generic framework for modeling device applications in the field of nanosized semiconductor heterostructures. The simulator deals with realistic geometries and almost any relevant combination of materials in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. It focuses on an accurate and reliable treatment of quantum mechanical effects and provides a self-consistent solution of the Schrodinger, Poisson, and current equations. Exchange-correlation effects are taken into account in terms of the local density scheme.

It requires a good understanding of quantum mechanics. The input language provides a number of tools that simplify setting up device geometry or running repetitive tasks. In this paper, we present a brief overview of nextnano and present four examples that demonstrate the wide range of possible applications for this software in the fields of solid-state quantum computation, nanoelectronics, and optoelectronics, namely, 1) a realization of a qubit based on coupled quantum wires in a magnetic field, 2) and 3) carrier transport in two different nano-MOSFET devices, and 4) a quantum cascade laser.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2007.902871","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4294186","Carrier transport;electronic structure;magnetic field;quantum;quantum wire;simulation;technology computer-aided design (TCAD)","Magnetic fields;Wires;Quantum cascade lasers;Mathematical model;Solid modeling;Materials;Quantum computing","electronic engineering computing;nanoelectronics;nanostructured materials;Poisson equation;quantum computing;Schrodinger equation;semiconductor process modelling;semiconductor quantum wires","nextnano;semiconductor nanodevice simulation;nanosized semiconductor heterostructure;quantum mechanical effect;Schrodinger equation;Poisson equation;exchange-correlation effect;electronic structure;solid-state quantum computation;nanoelectronics;optoelectronics","","331","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our proposed scheme integrates clustering with contention-free and/or -based medium access control (MAC) protocols. In our scheme, the elected cluster-head vehicle functions as the coordinator to collect/deliver real-time safety messages within its own cluster and forward the consolidated safety messages to the neighboring cluster heads. In addition, the cluster-head vehicle controls channel assignments for cluster-member vehicles transmitting/receiving nonreal-time traffics, which makes the wireless channels more efficiently utilized for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) nonreal-time data transmissions. Our scheme uses the contention-free MAC within a cluster and the contention-based IEEE 802.11 MAC among cluster-head vehicles such that the real-time delivery of safety messages can be guaranteed. Under our proposed scheme, we develop an analytical model to study the delay for the consolidated safety messages transmitted by the cluster-head vehicles. Based on this analytical model, we derive the desirable contention-window size, which can best balance the tradeoff between the delay of safety messages and the successful rate of delivering safety messages. The extensive simulation results show that, under various highway traffic scenarios, our proposed scheme can efficiently support the nonreal-time traffics while guaranteeing the real-time delivery of the safety messages.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2007.907233","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4357429","Clustering algorithms;Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC);multichannel medium-access control (MMAC);protocol designs;time–division multiple access (TDMA);vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications;vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs);Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs);vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications;dedicated short range communications (DSRC);protocol designs;clustering algorithms;multi-channel MAC;time division multiple access (TDMA)","Media Access Protocol;Vehicle safety;Analytical models;Delay;Traffic control;Road safety;Road vehicles;Communication system traffic control;Access protocols;Data communication","access protocols;ad hoc networks;data communication;electronic messaging;IEEE standards;multimedia communication;quality of service;safety;wireless LAN","clustering-based multichannel MAC protocols;QoS provisionings;vehicular ad hoc networks;dedicated short range communications multichannel architecture;cluster-based multichannel communications;public-safety message delivery;medium access;real-time safety messages;cluster-head vehicle controls channel assignments;cluster-member vehicles;nonreal-time traffics;wireless channels;vehicle-to-vehicle nonreal-time data transmissions;contention-free MAC;contention-based IEEE 802.11 MAC","","181","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Eriksen","Siemens Wind Power A/S, Brande; NA","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","","2007","22","3","937","943","In Denmark, incorporation of wind power into the power system is increasing whereas power generation from the large conventional power plants is reducing. The common concern has become maintenance of reliable and stable operation of the Danish power system with a large amount of wind power - the large wind power system. At present, maintaining the voltage stability of such a large wind power system relies on strong ac connections to neighboring power systems with sufficient reactive power and voltage control and on control of central power plants in Denmark. This paper presents the results of a stability investigation carried out by the Danish transmission system operator (TSO), Energinet.dk, for the case of almost island operation of the Western Danish wind power system. The main ac lines connecting Western Denmark to the synchronous area of the Union for the Co-ordination of Transmission of Electricity (UCTE) were out of service and the wind power generation was high. The investigation has shown that the reactive power and voltage control of the domestic power plants is essential for maintaining short-term voltage stability of the Western Danish wind power system and becomes even more relevant when ac connections to the strong transmission system of the UCTE are out of service. The results presented in this paper may also be relevant for the operators of the power systems that are in island ac operation and with plans for significant commissioning of wind power - Great Britain, Ireland, Tasmania, etc.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2007.901283","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4282004","Island operation;power system;reactive power and voltage control;voltage stability;wind power","Wind energy;Power system stability;Power system reliability;Power generation;Voltage control;Wind power generation;Maintenance;Reactive power control;Wind energy generation;Power system control","reactive power control;voltage control;wind power;wind power plants","reactive power control;voltage control;power plants;Danish transmission system operator;almost island operation;main ac lines;domestic power plants;short-term voltage stability;Western Danish wind power system","","55","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We experiment with different types of motion-direction sensitive units as well as different system architectures. As in [16], we find that sparse features in intermediate stages outperform dense ones and that using a simple feature selection approach leads to an efficient system that performs better with far fewer features.

This type of UAV shares limitations with most computer embedded systems: limited space, limited power resources, increasing computation requirements, complexity of the applications, time to market requirements, etc. UAVs are automatically piloted by an embedded system named ""Flight Control System."" Many of those systems are commercially available today, however no commercial system exists nowadays that provides support to the actual mission that the UAV should perform. This introduces a hardware/software architecture specially designed to operate as a flexible payload and mission controller in a mini/micro UAV. Given that the missions UAVs can carry on justify their existence; we believe that specific payload and mission controllers for UAVs should be developed.

The results show that both devices can operate at 450degC, which is impossible for conventional Si devices, at the expense of significant derating. The current capability of the SiC SBD does not change with temperature, but as expected the JFET current decreases with rising temperatures. A 100 V, 25 W dc-dc converter is used as an example of a high-temperature power-electronics circuit because of circuit simplicity. The converter is designed and built in accordance with the static characteristics of the SiC devices measured under extremely high ambient temperatures, and then tested up to an ambient temperature of 400degC. The conduction loss of the SiC JFET increases slightly with increasing temperatures, as predicted from its dc characteristics, but its switching characteristics hardly change.

The VSC-HVDC's ability to provide independent control of the converters ac voltage magnitudes and phase angles relative to the system voltage, which allows the use of separate active and reactive power control loops for system regulation, is well represented by the model. In this new development in Newton OPF, the VSC-HVDC system equations are incorporated directly into the matrix W for a unified optimal solution in a single frame-of-reference.

The limited availability of parking results in traffic congestion, air pollution as well as driver frustration. The price for parking expansion is usually prohibitive or extremely high. Recently researchers turned to applying technologies for efficient parking management. In our previous work, we have developed an optical wireless sensor network (WSN) for traffic monitoring. We have demonstrated our system to the public in several exhibitions. It is realized that this simple invention could be applied to monitor vehicles in a parking garage. The system can then inform drivers of the number of available parking spaces and in which area should they be directed to. This kind of system should avoid driver's frustration in trying endlessly to find a parking space in a crowded parking garage. This paper describes our work to modify our original WSN and applies it to parking garages. Problems associated to applying our original WSN to parking garage are explained, and solutions are proposed","","0-7695-2757-4","10.1109/SAINT-W.2007.98","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4090136","Smart Parking;Traffic Monitoring;WSN","Optical fiber networks;Optical sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Telecommunication traffic;Monitoring;Cities and towns;Air pollution;Ultraviolet sources;Technology management;Vehicles","optical fibre networks;traffic engineering computing;wireless sensor networks","smart parking;optical wireless sensor network;traffic congestion;air pollution;driver frustration;parking management;traffic monitoring;vehicle monitoring;crowded parking garage","","63","","3","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The magnetic system consists of three orthogonal coils, the source, fixed to the body and 3-D magnetic sensors, fixed to remote body segments, which measure the fields generated by the source. Based on the measured signals, a processor calculates the relative positions and orientations between source and sensor. Magnetic actuation requires a substantial amount of energy which limits the update rate with a set of batteries. Moreover, the magnetic field can easily be disturbed by ferromagnetic materials or other sources. Inertial sensors can be sampled at high rates, require only little energy and do not suffer from magnetic interferences. However, accelerometers and gyroscopes can only measure changes in position and orientation and suffer from integration drift. By combing measurements from both systems in a complementary Kalman filter structure, an optimal solution for position and orientation estimates is obtained. The magnetic system provides 6 DOF measurements at a relatively low update rate while the inertial sensors track the changes position and orientation in between the magnetic updates. The implemented system is tested against a lab-bound camera tracking system for several functional body movements. The accuracy was about 5 mm for position and 3 degrees for orientation measurements.

Center Utrecht, Utrecht; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","","2007","16","12","2879","2890","A popular technique for nonrigid registration of medical images is based on the maximization of their mutual information, in combination with a deformation field parameterized by cubic B-splines. The coordinate mapping that relates the two images is found using an iterative optimization procedure. This work compares the performance of eight optimization methods: gradient descent (with two different step size selection algorithms), quasi-Newton, nonlinear conjugate gradient, Kiefer-Wolfowitz, simultaneous perturbation, Robbins-Monro, and evolution strategy. Special attention is paid to computation time reduction by using fewer voxels to calculate the cost function and its derivatives. The optimization methods are tested on manually deformed CT images of the heart, on follow-up CT chest scans, and on MR scans of the prostate acquired using a BFFE, Tl, and T2 protocol. Registration accuracy is assessed by computing the overlap of segmented edges. Precision and convergence properties are studied by comparing deformation fields. The results show that the Robbins-Monro method is the best choice in most applications. With this approach, the computation time per iteration can be lowered approximately 500 times without affecting the rate of convergence by using a small subset of the image, randomly selected in every iteration, to compute the derivative of the mutual information. From the other methods the quasi-Newton and the nonlinear conjugate gradient method achieve a slightly higher precision, at the price of larger computation times.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2007.909412","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4374125","B-splines;mutual information;nonrigid image registration;optimization;subsampling","Optimization methods;Biomedical imaging;Image registration;Mutual information;Spline;Computed tomography;Convergence;Iterative algorithms;Cost function;Testing","computerised tomography;gradient methods;image registration;medical image processing;optimisation;splines (mathematics)","nonrigid medical image registration;mutual information maximization;deformation field;cubic B-splines;coordinate mapping;iterative optimization;gradient descent;step size selection;quasiNewton;Kiefer-Wolfowitz;simultaneous perturbation;evolution strategy;time reduction;cost function calculation;deformed CT images;CT chest scans","Algorithms;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","236","","49","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To obtain only the lower operating frequency band using superstrate layer is enough, but to extract the upper operating frequency band both superstrate layer and artificial surface as ground plane are necessary. Therefore, design of a superstrate to work in two frequency bands is very important. Initially, using appropriate frequency selective surface (FSS) structure with square loop elements, we design an optimum superstrate layer for each frequency band separately to achieve maximum directivity. Also, to design an artificial surface to work in the upper frequency band we use a suitable FSS structure over dielectric layer backed by PEC. Next, by using the idea of FSS structure with double square loop elements we propose FSS structure with modified double square loop elements, so that it operates in both of the desired operating frequency bands simultaneously.

A hand pose model is constructed in a one-time calibration step by measuring the fingertip positions in presence of ground-truth scale information.

For the realization of the sensor, polyimide and polydimethylsiloxane are used as a substrate, which makes it flexible. Thin metal strain gauges, which are incorporated into the polymer, are used for measuring normal and shear loads. The salient feature of this tactile sensor is that it has no diaphragm-like structures. The unit tactile cell characteristics are evaluated against normal and shear loads. The fabricated tactile sensor can measure normal loads of up to 4 N, and the sensor output signals are saturated against loads of more than 4 N. Shear loads can be detected by different voltage drops in strain gauges. The device has no fragile structures; therefore, it can be used as a ground reaction force (GRF) sensor for balance control in humanoid robots. Four tactile unit sensors are assembled and placed in the four corners of the robots sole. By increasing bump dimensions, the tactile unit sensor can measure loads of up to 2 kgf. When loads are exerted on the sole, the GRF can be measured by these four sensors.

The presence of phase noise can reduce the effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver, and consequently, limit the bit error rate (BER) and data rate. In this paper, the effect of phase noise on OFDM wireless systems is studied, and a compensation scheme is proposed to mitigate the common phase error and intercarrier interference (ICI) caused by phase noise. In the proposed scheme, the communication between the transmitter and receiver blocks consists of two stages. In the first stage, block-type pilot symbols are transmitted and the channel coefficients are jointly estimated with the phase noise in the time domain. In the second stage, comb-type OFDM symbols are transmitted such that the receiver can jointly estimate the data symbols and the phase noise. It is shown both by theory and computer simulations that the proposed scheme can effectively mitigate the ICI caused by phase noise and improve the BER of OFDM systems. Another benefit of the proposed scheme is that the sensitivity of OFDM receivers to phase noise can be significantly lowered, which helps simplify the oscillator and circuitry design in terms of implementation cost and power consumption.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2007.899583","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4355336","Common phase error;compensation scheme;equalization;intercarrier interference (ICI);orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM);performance analysis;phase-locked loop (PLL);phase noise","Phase noise;OFDM;Bit error rate;Signal to noise ratio;Phase estimation;Degradation;Wireless communication;Interference;Transmitters;Computer simulation","error statistics;intercarrier interference;OFDM modulation;phase noise;radio networks;time-domain analysis","oscillator design;circuitry design;channel coefficients;time domain;intercarrier interference;BER;bit error rate;signal-to-noise ratio;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;OFDM wireless systems;phase noise compensation","","87","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is the product of a sampling matrix (dependent on the antenna array only) and a Vandermonde structured coefficients vector depending on the wavefield only. This allows fast direction-of-arrival (DoA) algorithms designed for linear arrays to be used on arrays with arbitrary configuration. In real-world applications, the calibration measurements used to determine the sampling matrix are corrupted by noise. This impairs the performance of MST-based algorithms. In particular, we study the effect of noisy calibration measurements on subspace-based DoA algorithms using MST. Expressions describing the error in the DoA estimates due to calibration noise and truncation are derived. This allows predicting the performance of MST-based algorithms in real-world applications. The analysis is verified by simulations. We established a link between the optimal number of selected modes and the statistics of calibration noise.

For this purpose, a flow field generated by a moving crowd is treated as an aperiodic dynamical system. A grid of particles is overlaid on the flow field, and is advected using a numerical integration scheme. The evolution of particles through the flow is tracked using a flow map, whose spatial gradients are subsequently used to setup a Cauchy Green deformation tensor for quantifying the amount by which the neighboring particles have diverged over the length of the integration. The maximum eigenvalue of the tensor is used to construct a finite time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) field, which reveals the Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) present in the underlying flow. The LCS divide flow into regions of qualitatively different dynamics and are used to locate boundaries of the flow segments in a normalized cuts framework. Any change in the number of flow segments over time is regarded as an instability, which is detected by establishing correspondences between flow segments over time. The experiments are conducted on a challenging set of videos taken from Google Video and a National Geographic documentary.","1063-6919","1-4244-1179-3","10.1109/CVPR.2007.382977","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4270002","","Lagrangian functions;Stability analysis;Layout;Computer vision;Bridges;Cities and towns;Safety;Tensile stress;Videos;Fluid dynamics","gradient methods;image motion analysis;image segmentation;integration;object detection;stability","Lagrangian particle dynamics approach;crowd flow segmentation;flow stability analysis;numerical integration scheme;flow map;spatial gradient method;Cauchy Green deformation tensor;finite time Lyapunov exponent","","313","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, an analytical redundancy method using neural network modeling of the induction motor in vibration spectra is proposed for machine fault detection and diagnosis. The short-time Fourier transform is used to process the quasi-steady vibration signals to continuous spectra for the neural network model training.

Adaptive cruise control systems, platooning systems, and systems for stop-and-go traffic employ this concept: The ego vehicle follows a leader vehicle at a certain distance. The vehicle-following concept comes to its limitations when obstacles interfere with the path between the ego vehicle and the leader vehicle. We call such situations dynamic driving situations. This paper introduces a planning and decision component to generalize vehicle following to situations with nonautomated interfering vehicles in mixed traffic. As a demonstrator, we employ a car that is able to navigate autonomously through regular traffic that is longitudinally and laterally guided by actuators controlled by a computer. This paper focuses on and limits itself to lateral control for collision avoidance. Previously, this autonomous-driving capability was purely based on the vehicle-following concept using vision. The path of the leader vehicle was tracked. To extend this capability to dynamic driving situations, a dynamic path-planning component is introduced. Several driving situations are identified that necessitate responses to more than the leader vehicle. We borrow an idea from robotics to solve the problem. Treat the path of the leader vehicle as an elastic band that is subjected to repelling forces of obstacles in the surroundings. This elastic-band framework offers the necessary features to cover dynamic driving situations. Simulation results show the power of this approach.

Eng., Cape Town Univ., Rondebosch; NA","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","","2007","22","2","1056","1063","The fundamental voltage, current, and phase angle are required for a wide variety of power system applications. An algorithm that is capable of calculating or estimating these quantities in real time, in the presence of distorted waveforms, finds application in diverse areas of power systems. Techniques to detect voltage sag include the root mean square (rms), Fourier transform, and peak voltage detection methods. The problem with these methods is that they use a windowing technique and can therefore be too slow when applied to detect voltage sags for mitigation since they use historical data.

Most of the previous works in the field of pulsewidth modulation voltage-source converter (VSC) operation under unbalanced conditions propose dual vector controllers with dc bus voltage optimization strategies, which have been proven to be well adapted for rectifier applications. In this paper, two major contributions are made. On the one hand, a new optimized operation strategy based on exchanged power maximization is proposed for vector control structures, which permits the extension of optimized operation to other VSC applications (e.g., flexible alternating current transmission system and distributed generation interfaces). On the other hand, a scalar control structure is proposed based on resonant controllers, together with three adapted optimized operation strategies, namely: 1) dc bus voltage optimization; 2) power exchange maximization; and 3) a hybrid strategy (an intermediary mode between the other two strategies). Their main advantage is their simplicity and the lack of real-time symmetrical component extraction techniques. This scalar controller and the proposed optimized operation strategies are compared to conventional vector controllers. It is proven through experimental analysis that the proposed scalar controller offers very good performances with simpler structures and bigger flexibility in terms of operation modes.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2007.901373","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4300923","Current control;pulsewidth modulation (PWM) converters;voltage sag (dip);voltage unbalance","Pulse width modulation;Voltage control;Power conversion;Pulse width modulation converters;Power electronics;Rectifiers;Distributed control;Resonance;Power markets;Performance analysis","PWM power convertors;PWM rectifiers;transient analysis","PWM VSC control structures;unbalanced voltage transients;power electronic converter;pulsewidth modulation voltage-source converter;dual vector controllers;dc bus voltage optimization strategies;rectifier applications;power maximization;distributed generation interfaces;resonant controllers;power exchange maximization;hybrid strategy;real-time symmetrical component extraction techniques;scalar controller","","103","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To fill this gap, this study proposes a theoretical model that contains the factors that explain employees' IS security policy compliance. Data (N=245) from a Finnish company provides empirical support for the model. The results suggest that information quality has a significant effect on actual IS security policy compliance. Employees' attitude, normative beliefs and habits have significant effect on intention to comply with IS security policy.

Only modern variable speed wind turbines are treated in this work. The new E.ON Netz fault response code for WF is taken as the base case for the study. The results found in this paper are that the performance of the used Cigre 32-bus test system during disturbances is improved when the WF is complying with the E.ON code compared to the traditional unity power factor operation. Further improvements are found when the slope of the reactive current support line is increased from the E.ON specified value. In addition, a larger converter of a variable speed wind turbine is exploited that is to be used in order to improve the stability of a nearby grid by extending the reactive current support. By doing so, it is shown in this paper that the voltage profile at the point of common coupling (pcc) as well as the transient stability of the grid are improved compared to the original E.ON code, in addition to the improvements already achieved by using the E.ON code in its original form. Finally, regarding the utilization of a larger converter, it is important to point out that the possible reactive power in-feed into the pcc from an offshore WF decreases with increasing cable length during network faults, making it difficult to support the grid with extra reactive power during disturbances.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2007.907523","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4349135","Fault ride-through (FRT);frequency converter;grid code;grid support;reactive power control;static synchronous compensator (STATCOM);transient stability;variable speed wind turbine;voltage control","Voltage;Wind farms;Power system reliability;Power system stability;Wind turbines;Reactive power;Wind energy;Wind energy generation;Power system protection;Power system transients","fault diagnosis;power convertors;power factor;power generation faults;power system transient stability;reactive power control;static VAr compensators;wind power plants","voltage stability;power system transient stability;wind farms;E.ON netz grid code;power network disturbances;variable speed wind turbines;fault response code;Cigre 32-bus test system;unity power factor operation;reactive current support line;point-of-common coupling;reactive power control;STATCOM","","108","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While prefetching improves performance substantially on many programs, it can significantly reduce performance on others. Also, prefetching can significantly increase memory bandwidth requirements. This paper proposes a mechanism that incorporates dynamic feedback into the design of the prefetcher to increase the performance improvement provided by prefetching as well as to reduce the negative performance and bandwidth impact of prefetching. Our mechanism estimates prefetcher accuracy, prefetcher timeliness, and prefetcher-caused cache pollution to adjust the aggressiveness of the data prefetcher dynamically. We introduce a new method to track cache pollution caused by the prefetcher at run-time. We also introduce a mechanism that dynamically decides where in the LRU stack to insert the prefetched blocks in the cache based on the cache pollution caused by the prefetcher. Using the proposed dynamic mechanism improves average performance by 6.5% on 17 memory-intensive benchmarks in the SPEC CPU2000 suite compared to the best-performing conventional stream-based data prefetcher configuration, while it consumes 18.7% less memory bandwidth. Compared to a conventional stream-based data prefetcher configuration that consumes similar amount of memory bandwidth, feedback directed prefetching provides 13.6% higher performance. Our results show that feedback-directed prefetching eliminates the large negative performance impact incurred on some benchmarks due to prefetching, and it is applicable to stream-based prefetchers, global-history-buffer based delta correlation prefetchers, and PC-based stride prefetchers","2378-203X","1-4244-0804-0","10.1109/HPCA.2007.346185","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4147648","","Prefetching;Hardware;Bandwidth;Pollution;Delay;Random access memory;Energy consumption;Negative feedback;Runtime;Clocks","storage management","feedback directed prefetching;bandwidth-efficiency;hardware prefetcher;data prefetching;dynamic feedback;cache pollution;LRU stack;memory bandwidth;stream-based prefetcher;global-history-buffer based delta correlation prefetcher;PC-based stride prefetcher","","144","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a consequence, careful time-slot or frequency-reuse planning is required. This has adverse network data-rate and latency implications. The focus of this paper is a demonstration of signal processing techniques that enable simultaneous transmission and reception. These techniques employ informed-transmittermultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) links. A combination of adaptive transmit and receive antenna array approaches is exploited. A number of important types of networking limitations can be resolved given simultaneous transmit and receive technology. The first example is the simultaneous link problem. By employing transmit and receive spatial adaptivity, two links can operate in close proximity using the same frequency at the same time. Another example is the full duplex relay node. Using the same frequency for both links, a given node can simultaneously receive packets from one node while forwarding them to another. For practical systems, two issues dominate performance: channel estimation error, often caused by stale estimates of the channel at the transmitter, and dynamic range limitations of the transmitter and receiver. These issues are investigated. Theoretical, simulated, and experimental results are presented.","2373-0803","978-1-4244-1197-9","10.1109/SSP.2007.4301304","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4301304","MIMO systems;State feedback;Wireless;Cochannel interference;Adaptive arrays","Frequency;Transmitters;Limiting;Wireless mesh networks;Physical layer;Delay;Adaptive signal processing;Array signal processing;MIMO;Receiving antennas","","","","71","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Implemented at medium voltage level, the DVR can be used to protect a group of medium voltage or low voltage consumers. However, the DVR will therefore be tasked to mitigate even more faults involving downstream loads. Large fault currents would flow through the DVR during a downstream fault before the opening of a circuit breaker. This will cause the voltage at point of common coupling (PCC) to drop, which would affect the loads on the other parallel feeders connected to PCC. Furthermore, if not controlled properly, the DVR might also contribute to this PCC voltage sag in the process of compensating the missing voltage, thus further worsening the fault situation. To limit the flow of large line currents, and therefore restore the PCC voltage as well as protect the DVR system components, a downstream fault limiting function is proposed and integrated in the DVR operation. A flux-charge-model feedback algorithm is implemented so that the DVR would act as a large virtual inductance in series with the distribution feeder in fault situations. Controlling the DVR as a virtual inductor would also ensure zero real power absorption during the DVR compensation and thus minimize the stress in the dc link. Finally, the proposed fault current limiting algorithm has been tested in Matlab/Simulink simulation and experimentally on a medium voltage level laboratory DVR system.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2007.900589","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4267759","Dynamic voltage restorer (DVR);fault current limiting;flux-charge model control;virtual inductance;voltage sag","Medium voltage;Fault currents;Circuit faults;Protection;Voltage fluctuations;Power systems;Low voltage;Circuit breakers;Coupling circuits;Voltage control","circuit breakers;fault current limiters;power distribution faults;power grids;power supply quality","dual-functional medium voltage level DVR;downstream fault currents;dynamic voltage restorer;power distribution networks;grid voltage;downstream loads;circuit breaker;common coupling;parallel feeders;voltage sag;large line currents;downstream fault limiting function;flux-charge-model feedback algorithm;virtual inductance;distribution feeder;virtual inductor;zero real power absorption;Matlab/Simulink simulation","","57","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since the discovery of turbo codes in 1993, the research community has invested a great deal of work on modern iteratively decoded codes, and naturally NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has been very much involved. This paper describes the research, design, implementation, and standardization work that has taken place at JPL for both turbo and low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Turbo code development proceeded from theoretical analyses of polynomial selection, weight distributions imposed by interleaver designs, decoder error floors, and iterative decoding thresholds.

The primary-parallel-secondary-series structure is employed in this paper to handle the large input current, sustain the high output voltage and extend the voltage gain. A novel active clamp boost converter with coupled-inductors is proposed for high step-up applications. The third windings of the coupled-inductors have the function of voltage gain extension and the switch voltage stress reduction. The active clamp circuit serves for the interleaved two phases, which reduces the circuit complexity. Both the main and the auxiliary switches of the proposed converter are zero voltage transition performances during the whole switching transition. Meanwhile, the leakage energy is recycled by the active clamp circuit. The rectifier voltage stress is reduced by the primary-parallel-secondary-series structure. The rectifier reverse-recovery problem is alleviated by the leakage inductance. Experimental results for a 40-V-to-760-V converter verify the significant improvements in efficiency.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2007.909195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4371550","Active clamp;coupled-inductors;isolated boost converter","Clamps;Switches;Coupling circuits;Stress;Rectifiers;Topology;Complexity theory;Switching converters;Zero voltage switching;Inductance","DC-DC power convertors;inductors;rectifying circuits;switching convertors","isolated ZVT boost converters;current topologies;step-up dc-dc conversion;active clamp boost converter;coupled-inductors;voltage gain extension;switch voltage stress reduction;active clamp circuit;circuit complexity;auxiliary switches;leakage energy;rectifier voltage stress;rectifier reverse-recovery problem;leakage inductance","","76","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We first derive the new QKF for nonlinear systems with additive Gaussian noise by linearizing the process and measurement functions using statistical linear regression (SLR) through a set of Gauss-Hermite quadrature points that parameterize the Gaussian density. Moreover, we discuss how the new QKF can be extended and modified to take into account specific details of a given application. We then go on to extend the use of the new QKF to discrete-time, nonlinear systems with additive, possibly non-Gaussian noise. A bank of parallel QKFs, called the Gaussian sum-quadrature Kalman filter (GS-QKF) approximates the predicted and posterior densities as a finite number of weighted sums of Gaussian densities. The weights are obtained from the residuals of the QKFs. Three different Gaussian mixture reduction techniques are presented to alleviate the growing number of the Gaussian sum terms inherent to the GS-QKFs. Simulation results exhibit a significant improvement of the GS-QKFs over other nonlinear filtering approaches, namely, the basic bootstrap (particle) filters and Gaussian-sum extended Kalman filters, to solve nonlinear non- Gaussian filtering problems.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2007.894705","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4266868","Gauss–Hermite Quadrature Rule;Gaussian sum filter;nonlinear filtering;quadrature Kalman filter;statistical linear regression (SLR)","Filtering algorithms;Gaussian processes;Additive noise;Nonlinear systems;Gaussian noise;Testing;Density measurement;Noise measurement;Linear regression;Filters","discrete time filters;Kalman filters;nonlinear filters;nonlinear systems;regression analysis;AWGN channels","discrete-time nonlinear filtering;Gauss-Hermite quadrature;nonlinear systems;additive Gaussian noise;statistical linear regression;nonGaussian noise;Gaussian sum-quadrature Kalman filter;Gaussian density;Gaussian mixture reduction;bootstrap filters","","305","","63","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While the examples involve low-order plants, the principles of employing the complex lead and lag compensators remain the same for higher-order systems. We plan to use these compensators as weighting functions with automated robust design tools. A weighting function is a transfer function whose frequency response magnitude is used to bound closed-loop response or modeling uncertainty.

The impact of LER on the matching performance of FinFETs is investigated through statistical device simulations, comparing the relative importance of fin- and gate-LER. Fin-LER is shown to significantly degrade FinFET matching performance under DC and transient operations. Combining our device simulation results with experimental data, it is shown that fin-LER will dominate the intra-bit-cell stochastic mismatch in FinFET static random access memories at the LSTP-32-nm node.

Rear-end collisions account for a large portion of traffic accidents. To help mitigate this problem, predictive braking systems and adaptive cruise control systems have been developed. However, these types of systems usually rely solely on the vehicle and vehicle surround sensors, either ignoring the human component of driving or learning the driver's control behavior using only these sensors. As with all human-computer interfaces, this has the potential to work against the driver, distract the driver further, or even annoy the driver so that the driver ignores or disables the system. It is, therefore, important to directly take the driver's intended actions into account when designing a driver assistance system. By using a probabilistic model for the system, warnings and preventative measures can be constructed based on varying levels of situational severity and driver attentiveness and intent. The research is based upon carefully conducted experimental trials involving a human subjects driving in natural manner and on typical freeways in the USA. The experiments, designed by inputs from cognitive scientist, were conducted in a specially designed instrumented vehicle to record important cues associated with driver's behavior, vehicle state, and vehicle surround in a synchronized manner.

Besides, a suitable capacitive or inductive cross-coupled effect is introduced so as to create two transmission zeros for improving the filter selectivity; however, it also enhances the signal imbalance and degrades the common-mode rejection. In this study, various second- and fourth-order balanced filters are implemented to discuss the associated differential-mode responses and the signal-imbalance phenomena resulted from the cross-coupled effect. Specifically, the fourth-order filter with a common-mode rejection ratio of 40 dB within the passband is demonstrated and examined","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2006.889147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4084857","Balanced filter;common-mode noise suppression;coupled-line bandpass filter;quarter-wavelength resonator","Band pass filters;Circuit noise;Working environment noise;Resonator filters;1f noise;Impedance matching;Microwave filters;Coupling circuits;Dipole antennas;Noise level","band-pass filters;equivalent circuits;interference suppression;microwave filters;poles and zeros;UHF filters","balanced coupled-line filter;bandpass filters;common-mode noise suppression;quarter-wavelength resonators;equivalent half-circuits;differential-mode response;capacitive cross-coupled effect;inductive cross-coupled effect;transmission zeros;improved filter selectivity;common-mode rejection;second-order balanced filter;fourth-order balanced filters;signal-imbalance phenomena","","140","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The problem with computing SRP is that the SRP space has many local maxima and thus computationally-intensive grid-search methods are used to find a global maximum. Grid search is too expensive for a real-time system. Several papers have addressed this issue. In this paper we propose using stochastic region contraction (SRC) to make computing the SRP practical.

Directional rotary motion of discrete displacement is achieved by sequentially pressurizing the three ports of the motor. Pulsed pressure waves are generated by a remote pneumatic distributor. The motor assembly includes a motor, gearhead, and incremental position encoder in a compact, central bore construction. A special electronic driver is used to control the new motor with electric stepper indexers and standard motion control cards. The motor accepts open-loop step operation as well as closed-loop control with position feedback from the enclosed sensor. A special control feature is implemented to adapt classic control algorithms to the new motor, and is experimentally validated. The speed performance of the motor degrades with the length of the pneumatic hoses between the distributor and motor. Experimental results are presented to reveal this behavior and set the expectation level. Nevertheless, the stepper achieves easily controllable precise motion unlike other pneumatic motors. The motor was designed to be compatible with magnetic resonance medical imaging equipment, for actuating an image-guided intervention robot, for medical applications. For this reason, the motors were entirely made of nonmagnetic and dielectric materials such as plastics, ceramics, and rubbers.

Akhtar","Indian Inst. of Technol., Mumbai; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","","2007","54","7","1584","1598","A general circuit-based model of LC oscillator phase noise applicable to both white noise and 1/f noise is presented. Using the Kurokawa theory, differential equations governing the relationship between amplitude and phase noise at the tank are derived and solved. Closed form equations are obtained for the IEEE oscillator phase noise for both white and 1/f noise. These solutions introduce new parameters which take into account the correlation between the amplitude noise and phase noise and link them to the oscillator circuit operating point. These relations are then used to obtain the final expression for voltage noise power density across the output oscillator terminals assuming the noise can be modeled by stationary Gaussian processes. For white noise, general conditions under which the phase noise relaxes to closed-form Lorentzian spectra are derived for two practical limiting cases. Further, the buffer noise in oscillators is examined. The forward contribution of the buffer to the white noise floor for large offset frequency is expressed in terms of the buffer noise parameters. The backward contribution of the buffer to the 1/Delta f2 oscillator noise is also quantified. To model flicker noise, the Kurokawa theory is extended by modeling each 1 /f noise perturbation in the oscillator as a small-signal dc perturbation of the oscillator operating point. A trap-level model of flicker noise is used for the analysis. Conditions under which the resulting flicker noise relaxes to an 1/Delta f3 phase noise distribution are derived. The proposed model is then applied to a practical differential oscillator. A novel method of analysis, splitting the noise contribution of the various transistors into modes is introduced to calculate the Kurokawa noise parameters. The modes that contribute the most to white noise and flicker noise are identified. Further, the tail noise contribution is analyzed and shown to be mostly up-converted noise. The combined white and flicker noise model exhibits the presence of a number of corner frequencies whose values depend upon the relative strengths of the various noise components. The proposed model is compared with a popular harmonic balance simulator and a reasonable agreement is obtained in the respective range of validity of the simulator and theory. The analytical theory presented which relies on measurable circuit parameters provides valuable insight for oscillator performance optimization as is discussed in the paper.","1558-0806","","10.1109/TCSI.2007.898673","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4268411","Correlation;flicker noise;Kurokawa;Lorentzian;noise floor;phase noise;traps;uncorrelated modes;white noise","Circuit analysis;Phase noise;1f noise;Oscillators;Circuit noise;White noise;Gaussian noise;Frequency;Circuit simulation;Differential equations","1/f noise;circuit noise;differential equations;flicker noise;Gaussian processes;nonlinear network analysis;oscillators;phase noise;white noise","analytic circuit-based model;white noise;flicker phase noise;LC oscillators;1/f noise;differential equations;IEEE oscillator phase noise;amplitude noise;oscillator circuit operating point;voltage noise power density;stationary Gaussian processes;buffer noise;harmonic balance simulator;Kurokawa theory","","23","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

During steady state operation, conventional current mode proportional-integral-derivative (PID) is used. During large signal transient conditions, the new control algorithm takes over. The equations needed to calculate the transient time and the required duty cycle series are presented. By using the proposed algorithm, the optimal transient performances, including the smallest output voltage overshoot/undershoot and the shortest recovery time, is achieved. In addition, since the large signal dynamic response of the power converter is successfully predicted, the large signal stability is guaranteed.

The new idea of this control strategy is to give high priority to keep up the ac voltage and slightly decrease the frequency during disturbances. The motivation for choosing this strategy is that the sensitive processing industries are much more sensitive to voltage drops as compared with frequency deviations. In order to test this control strategy, the dynamic performance of a VSC-HVDC supplied industrial plant is investigated during sudden load disturbances, balanced and unbalanced faults from the grid. Simulation results obtained using PSCAD/EMTDC show that with the use of the proposed control strategy, the system can ride through disturbances such as motor starting and faults by slightly decreasing the frequency. The current limit of the VSC-HVDC converters has a significant influence on the dynamics of the system. An increase of the current limit significantly improves the power quality of the system. The comparison of the behavior between a pure ac supplied industrial plant and a VSC-HVDC supplied industrial plant clearly shows the capability of the VSC-HVDC to mitigate voltage dips during faults.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2007.899622","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4302517","AC voltage control;dc voltage control;frequency control;power quality;voltage dips;VSC–HVDC","Control systems;Industrial plants;Converters;Power conversion;Frequency;Voltage control;Electricity supply industry;Testing;PSCAD;EMTDC","frequency control;HVDC power convertors;HVDC power transmission;industrial power systems;power supply quality;power system CAD;power transmission control;voltage control","voltage dips;frequency control;DC voltage control;AC voltage control;current limit;PSCAD/EMTDC;load disturbances;power supply quality;industrial plants;VSC-HVDC system;voltage source converters","","66","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Fixed speed wind turbines (FSWTs) are a diminishing but significant sector in the fast-growing wind turbine (WT) market. State-of-art techniques applied to meet grid requirements for FSWT wind farms are blade pitching and dynamic reactive power compensation (RPC). Blade pitching is constrained by the onerous mechanical loads imposed on a wind turbine during rapid power restoration. Dynamic RPC is constrained by its high capital cost. These present technologies can therefore be limiting, especially when connecting to smaller power systems. A novel alternative technology is proposed that inserts series resistance into the generation circuit. The series dynamic braking resistor (SDBR) dissipates active power and boosts generator voltage, potentially displacing the need for pitch control and dynamic RPC. This paper uses a representative wind farm model to study the beneficial effect of SDBR compared to dynamic RPC. This is achieved by quasi-steady-state characterization and transient FRT stability simulations. The analysis shows that SDBR can substantially improve the FRT performance of a FSWT wind farm.

Having analyzed different semiconductive and insulating materials candidate for HVDC cable applications, the best solution to be exploited for HVDC cable design would be the combination showing a high threshold for space charge accumulation, a small rate of charge accumulation as a function of electric field and a small activation energy, i.e., a space charge amount less dependent on temperature. Therefore, space charge measurements will provide important information to cable material manufacturers with the aim of tailoring insulation and semicon specifically for HVDC application and, thus, improving the reliability of polymeric cables.","1558-4402","","10.1109/MEI.2007.4389975","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4389975","","Polymers;HVDC transmission;Space charge;Semiconductor materials;Cable insulation;Acceleration;Degradation;Dielectrics and electrical insulation;Temperature dependence;Current measurement","HVDC power transmission;insulating materials;power cable insulation;semiconductor materials;space charge","polymeric HVDC cable design;space charge accumulation;semicon interface;insulation system;semiconductive material;insulating materials;electric field;space charge measurements;cable material manufacturers","","122","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

"Histogram of Gabor Phase Patterns (HGPP): A Novel Object Representation Approach for Face Recognition","B. Zhang; S. Shan; X. Chen; W. Gao","Harbin Inst. of Technol.; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","","2007","16","1","57","68","A novel object descriptor, histogram of Gabor phase pattern (HGPP), is proposed for robust face recognition. In HGPP, the quadrant-bit codes are first extracted from faces based on the Gabor transformation. Global Gabor phase pattern (GGPP) and local Gabor phase pattern (LGPP) are then proposed to encode the phase variations. GGPP captures the variations derived from the orientation changing of Gabor wavelet at a given scale (frequency), while LGPP encodes the local neighborhood variations by using a novel local XOR pattern (LXP) operator. They are both divided into the nonoverlapping rectangular regions, from which spatial histograms are extracted and concatenated into an extended histogram feature to represent the original image. Finally, the recognition is performed by using the nearest-neighbor classifier with histogram intersection as the similarity measurement. The features of HGPP lie in two aspects: 1) HGPP can describe the general face images robustly without the training procedure; 2) HGPP encodes the Gabor phase information, while most previous face recognition methods exploit the Gabor magnitude information. In addition, Fisher separation criterion is further used to improve the performance of HGPP by weighing the subregions of the image according to their discriminative powers. The proposed methods are successfully applied to face recognition, and the experiment results on the large-scale FERET and CAS-PEAL databases show that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform other well-known systems in terms of recognition rate","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2006.884956","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4032834","Face recognition;feature extraction;Gabor;histogram;local pattern;phase pattern","Histograms;Face recognition;Frequency;Feature extraction;Robustness;Image databases;Pattern recognition;Computers;Concatenated codes;Performance evaluation","face recognition;image coding;image representation;wavelet transforms","object representation;face recognition;histogram of Gabor phase pattern;quadrant-bit codes;nonoverlapping rectangular regions;spatial histograms;Fisher separation criterion;local Gabor phase pattern;global Gabor phase pattern;Gabor wavelet;local XOR pattern operator","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biometry;Cluster Analysis;Face;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated","402","","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The mother wavelet and the basis of wavelet packets were optimized and the wavelet coefficients were encoded with a modified version of the embedded zerotree algorithm. This signal dependant compression scheme was designed by a two-step process. The first (internal optimization) was the best basis selection that was performed for a given mother wavelet. For this purpose, three additive cost functions were applied and compared. The second (external optimization) was the selection of the mother wavelet based on the minimal distortion of the decoded signal given a fixed compression ratio. The mother wavelet was parameterized in the multiresolution analysis framework by the scaling filter, which is sufficient to define the entire decomposition in the orthogonal case. The method was tested on two sets of ten electromyographic (EMG) and ten electrocardiographic (ECG) signals that were compressed with compression ratios in the range of 50%-90%. For 90% compression ratio of EMG (ECG) signals, the percent residual difference after compression decreased from (mean ) 48.69.9% (21.58.4%) with discrete wavelet transform (DWT) using the wavelet leading to poorest performance to 28.43.0% (6.71.9%) with DWPT, with optimal basis selection and wavelet optimization. In conclusion, best basis selection and optimization of the mother wavelet through parameterization led to substantial improvement of performance in signal compression with respect to DWT and randon selection of the mother wavelet. The method provides an adaptive approach for optimal signal representation for compression and can thus be applied to any type of biomedical signal.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2007.896596","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4360002","Embedded zerotree;wavelet design;wavelet packet;Wavelet design;wavelet packet;embedded zero-tree","Wavelet packets;Discrete wavelet transforms;Electromyography;Electrocardiography;Wavelet coefficients;Signal processing;Signal design;Cost function;Distortion;Decoding","data compression;discrete wavelet transforms;medical signal processing","biomedical signal compression;mother wavelet optimization;best-basis wavelet packet selection;discrete wavelet packet transform;embedded zerotree algorithm;basis selection;electromyographic signal;electrocardiographic signal;percent residual difference;discrete wavelet transform","Algorithms;Biomedical Engineering;Data Compression;Electrocardiography;Electromyography;Information Storage and Retrieval;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","83","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A large step forward in the area of meshing was introduced by a method called ""perfect boundary approximation (PBA)"" and it allowed a technique to represent curves and inclines very accurately within a coarse discretization. One main advantage of the time domain solver of CST MWS is that the resource requirement only scales linear with the numbers of mesh nodes and therefore the problem size. Thus it is possible to handle large radiating structures and even complete arrays with more than some hundreds of radiating elements. The ability to extract a high resolution of broadband antenna data is a result of the time domain solver's ability to define and calculate a large number of farfield monitors in one single simulation run. This represents a significant performance advantage compared to non-time domain methods which entail the simulation of a large number of discrete frequencies for the broadband data extraction. However, despite having the ability to solve a vast variety of problems, other techniques have shown advantages for certain class of problem. A frequency domain method based on hexa- and tetrahedral meshing was introduced to focus on the subset of problems where this technique excelled, e.g. in narrow band antennas, electrically smaller devices or phased array unit cells. Both solvers -time and frequency domain- are completely available on a common user-interface. Examples included and demonstrated here are UWB- antennas, RF-IDs, phased arrays and antennas based on left-handed- materials (LHM).

By introducing a new and more general 3-D geometrical model than that applied in earlier work, additional insight into the optimal design parameters is gained. We also perform a novel analysis of the sensitivity of the optimal design parameters, and derive analytical expressions for the eigenvalues of the pure LOS channel matrix which are valid also when allowing for non-optimal design. Furthermore, we investigate the approximations introduced in the derivations, in order to reveal when the results are applicable.

The proposed balun structure is able to operate at millimeter wave frequencies and it does not require any tight line coupling sections as frequently used in monolithic microwave integrated circuit balun design. In addition, this balun can be integrated with other planar topologies including nonplanar circuits made of the same substrate for achieving high efficiency. This balun structure consists of a 3 dB SIW power divider and microstrip lines that are placed on both sides of the substrate at balanced ports to obtain an 180deg phase shift. The concept is validated by simulations and measurements. Our measured results suggest that a 10 dB return loss at unbalanced port can easily be achieved across a 42% bandwidth from 19 to 29 GHz.

By using the asynchronous dynamical systems approach and the average dwell-time method, sufficient conditions for the exponential stability of the closed-loop NCS are presented in terms of nonlinear matrix inequalities, and the relation between the packet dropout rate and the stability of the closed-loop NCS is explicitly established.

This paper presents novel classification algorithms for recognizing object activity using object motion trajectory. In the proposed classification system, trajectories are segmented at points of change in curvature, and the subtrajectories are represented by their principal component analysis (PCA) coefficients. We first present a framework to robustly estimate the multivariate probability density function based on PCA coefficients of the subtrajectories using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). We show that GMM-based modeling alone cannot capture the temporal relations and ordering between underlying entities. To address this issue, we use hidden Markov models (HMMs) with a data-driven design in terms of number of states and topology (e.g., left-right versus ergodic). Experiments using a database of over 5700 complex trajectories (obtained from UCI-KDD data archives and Columbia University Multimedia Group) subdivided into 85 different classes demonstrate the superiority of our proposed HMM-based scheme using PCA coefficients of subtrajectories in comparison with other techniques in the literature.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2007.898960","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4237188","Activity recognition;Gaussian mixture models (GMMs);hidden Markov models (HMMs);trajectory modeling","Hidden Markov models;Principal component analysis;Motion analysis;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Robustness;Multimedia databases;Multimedia systems;Tracking;Global Positioning System;Video surveillance","hidden Markov models;object detection;object recognition","activity recognition;Gaussian mixture models;multivariate probability density function;principal component analysis;object motion trajectory;hidden Markov models;object recognition;object trajectory-based activity classification","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Markov Chains;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated","175","","48","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Performance analysis of A-MPDU and A-MSDU aggregation in IEEE 802.11n","B. Ginzburg; A. Kesselman","Intel Corporation, Haifa, Israel; Intel Corporation, Haifa, Israel","2007 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","","2007","","","1","5","With recent improvements in physical layer (PHY) techniques, the achievable capacity for wireless LANs (WLANs) has grown significantly. However, the overhead of IEEE 802.11 MAC layer has limited the actual throughput of a WLAN. A-MPDU aggregation suggested in IEEE 802.11n draft is a key enhancement reducing the protocol timing overheads that enables aggregation of several MAC-level protocol data units (MPDUs) into a single PHY protocol data unit (PPDU). Another aggregation scheme proposed in IEEE 802.11n is A-MSDU aggregation, which allows several MAC-level service data units (MSDUs) to be aggregated into a single MPDU. In this work we present a novel analytic model for estimating the performance of a 802.11n high throughput wireless link between a station and an Access Point (AP). We consider a 2 times 2 MIMO system and investigate how the MAC goodput under TCP and UDP traffic is affected by the aggregation size, packet error rate and PHY settings. Our results demonstrate that for UDP traffic, A-MPDU aggregation allows to achieve a high channel utilization of 95% in the ideal case while without aggregation the channel utilization is limited by just 33%. We also show that A-MPDU aggregation outperforms A-MSDU aggregation, whose performance considerably degrades for high packet error rates and high PHY rates.","","978-1-4244-2483-2","10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567389","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4567389","","Performance analysis;Physical layer;Protocols;Wireless LAN;Throughput;Error analysis;Timing;MIMO;Traffic control;Degradation","access protocols;error statistics;telecommunication traffic;wireless channels;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.1 In;physical layer;MAC layer;protocol timing overheads;MAC-level service data units;MAC-level protocol data units;wireless LAN;wireless link;access point;MIMO system;TCP;UDP traffic;packet error rate;aggregation size;channel utilization","","57","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Three SVMs are trained to provide fault classification, ground detection, and section identification, respectively, for the line using TCSC. The SVMs are trained with polynomial kernel and Gaussian kernel with different parameter values to get the most optimized classifier.

"Load Shedding: A New Proposal","R. Faranda; A. Pievatolo; E. Tironi","Politecnico di Milano, Milan; Politecnico di Milano, Milan; Politecnico di Milano, Milan","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","","2007","22","4","2086","2093","During overloads in the mains, the load curtailment applied to interruptible loads is often the only solution to keep the network in operation. Normally, in contingencies, the difference between the power absorbed and the power produced is very low, often less than 1% of the latter. Therefore if all the loads participated in the load shedding program, the discomfort would be minimal, considering its usually short duration. According to this point of view, we present a new approach to the load shedding program to guarantee the correct electrical system operation by increasing the number of participants. This new load control strategy is named Distributed Interruptible Load Shedding (DILS). Indeed, it is possible to split every user's load into interruptible and uninterruptible parts, and to operate on the interruptible part only. The optimal load reduction request is found by minimizing the expected value of an appropriate cost function, thus taking the uncertainty about the power absorbed by each customer into account. Presently, several users such as hospitals, data centres, supermarkets, universities, industries, etc. might be very interested in typical shedding programs as a way to spare money in their electrical account. However, in the future, when the domotic power plants are likely to be used widely, the distributors could interest the end users in participating in DILS programs for either economic or social reasons. By adopting the DILS program, the distributors can resort to the interruptible loads not only in case of emergency conditions but also during normal and alert operations.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2007.907390","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4349076","Black out;demand side management;interruptible load;load shedding;stochastic approximation;uncertain system","Proposals;Electronics packaging;Load flow control;Cost function;Uncertainty;Hospitals;Educational institutions;Power generation;Power system economics;Power generation economics","load shedding;power distribution economics","power plant;DILS;distributed interruptible load shedding;electrical system operation","","91","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When the description of a system's architecture does not exist, attempts must be made to recover it. In recent years, researchers have explored the use of clustering for recovering a software system's architecture, given only its source code. The main contributions of this paper are given as follows. First, we review hierarchical clustering research in the context of software architecture recovery and modularization. Second, to employ clustering meaningfully, it is necessary to understand the peculiarities of the software domain, as well as the behavior of clustering measures and algorithms in this domain. To this end, we provide a detailed analysis of the behavior of various similarity and distance measures that may be employed for software clustering. Third, we analyze the clustering process of various well-known clustering algorithms by using multiple criteria, and we show how arbitrary decisions taken by these algorithms during clustering affect the quality of their results. Finally, we present an analysis of two recently proposed clustering algorithms, revealing close similarities in their apparently different clustering approaches. Experiments on four legacy software systems provide insight into the behavior of well-known clustering algorithms and their characteristics in the software domain.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2007.70732","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4339232","Software Engineering;Restructuring;reverse engineering;and reengineering;architecture recovery;hierarchical clustering;arbitrary decisions","Software architecture;Computer architecture;Software systems;Clustering algorithms;Software measurement;Software algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Taxonomy;Partitioning algorithms;Reverse engineering","software architecture","software architecture recovery;architectural level understanding;hierarchical clustering research;software modularization;software domain;clustering algorithms;arbitrary decisions","","185","","79","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One such routing misbehavior is that some selfish nodes will participate in the route discovery and maintenance processes but refuse to forward data packets. In this paper, we propose the 2ACK scheme that serves as an add-on technique for routing schemes to detect routing misbehavior and to mitigate their adverse effect. The main idea of the 2ACK scheme is to send two-hop acknowledgment packets in the opposite direction of the routing path.

In this paper, we show that Toeplitz-structured matrices with entries drawn independently from the same distributions are also sufficient to recover x from y with high probability, and we compare the performance of such matrices with that of fully independent and identically distributed ones. The use of Toeplitz matrices in CS applications has several potential advantages: (i) they require the generation of only O(n) independent random variables; (ii) multiplication with Toeplitz matrices can be efficiently implemented using fast Fourier transform, resulting in faster acquisition and reconstruction algorithms; and (iii) Toeplitz-structured matrices arise naturally in certain application areas such as system identification.","2373-0803","978-1-4244-1197-9","10.1109/SSP.2007.4301266","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4301266","Compressed sensing;restricted isometry property;system identification;Toeplitz matrices;underdetermined systems of linear equations","Compressed sensing;Signal processing;Probability distribution;Sparse matrices;Data compression;Image processing;System identification;Gas insulated transmission lines;Optical computing;Random variables","","","","150","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Tunability is achieved by connecting adjacent patches with varactor diodes thus altering the capacitance between the patches and hence the surface's resonance frequency. The varactor diodes are biased with the aid of a resistive grid. The grid is made resistive using surface mount resistors. Using an approximate equivalent circuit the effect of the varactor diode resistance is investigated for normal plane wave incidence. It is shown that at resonance, a small varactor resistance may lead to a significant absorption. The potential use of a waveguide simulator to characterize approximately the performance of the proposed metamaterial structure is investigated.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2007.900228","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4267917","Absorber;high impedance surface (HIS);metamaterial structure;tunable;waveguide simulator","Surface impedance;Varactors;Diodes;Surface resistance;Resonance;Tunable circuits and devices;Joining processes;Capacitance;Resonant frequency;Resistors","electric resistance;electrical resistivity;equivalent circuits;metamaterials;surface mount technology;varactors;waveguides","varactor-tunable high impedance surface;resistive-lumped-element biasing grid;tunability;varactor diodes;resonance frequency;surface mount resistor;equivalent circuit;varactor resistance;waveguide simulator;metamaterial structure","","99","","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Whether in dc or ac form, photovoltaic cells provide power for systems in many applications on earth and space. Its principles of operation are therefore well understood, and circuit equivalents have been developed that accurately model the nonlinear relationship between the current and voltage of a photovoltaic cell. With the improved efficiencies of power electronics converters, it is now possible to operate photovoltaic system about its maximum power point (MPP) in order to improve the overall system efficiency. Hitherto, this problem has been tackled using tracking (MPPT) algorithms that iteratively find the point of maximum power and respond to changes in solar irradiance accordingly. A mathematical manipulation that uses the mean value theorem is presented here that provides the analytic solution of a point in a close neighborhood of the MPP. It is thoroughly proved that this point is enclosed in a ball of small radius that also contains the MPP and therefore can practically be considered as the MPP. Since the solution is analytic, no iterative schemes are necessary, and only a periodic measurement is required to adjust to changes in solar irradiance. A circuit is implemented that shows the validity of the theory and the accuracy of the solution.","1558-0806","","10.1109/TCSI.2007.902537","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4303308","Circuit modeling;dc–dc power conversion;photovoltaic cells;tracking","Photovoltaic systems;Solar power generation;Voltage;Photovoltaic cells;Circuits;Iterative algorithms;P-n junctions;Power engineering and energy;Earth;Power system modeling","DC-DC power convertors;photovoltaic power systems;solar cells","power electronics converter;photovoltaic cells;photovoltaic maximum power point problem","","111","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This passive exoskeleton does not use any motors but is designed to unload the human leg joints from the gravity load over its range-of-motion. The underlying principle of gravity balancing is to make the potential energy of the combined leg-machine system invariant with configuration of the leg. Additionally, parameters of the exoskeleton can be changed to achieve a prescribed level of gravity assistance, from 0% to 100%. The goal of the results reported in this paper is to provide preliminary quantitative assessment of the changes in kinematics and kinetics of the walking gait when a human subject wears such an exoskeleton. The data on kinematics and kinetics were collected on four healthy and three stroke patients who wore this exoskeleton. These data were computed from the joint encoders and interface torque sensors mounted on the exoskeleton. This exoskeleton was also recently used for a six-week training of a chronic stroke patient, where the gravity assistance was progressively reduced from 100% to 0%. The results show a significant improvement in gait of the stroke patient in terms of range-of-motion of the hip and knee, weight bearing on the hemiparetic leg, and speed of walking. Currently, training studies are underway to assess the long-term effects of such a device on gait rehabilitation of hemiparetic stroke patients.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2007.903930","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4303095","Gravity balancing;passive orthosis;rehabilitation;stroke patients;walking","Leg;Gravity;Exoskeletons;Humans;Kinematics;Kinetic theory;Legged locomotion;Springs;Geometry;Potential energy","biomechanics;handicapped aids;patient rehabilitation","swing leg motion;gait rehabilitation;gravity balancing exoskeleton;University of Delaware;Newark;rigid links;springs;hemiparetic stroke patient;passive orthosis;chronic stroke patient;interface torque sensors;human kinetics;kinematics;gravity assistance;leg-machine system;gravity load;human leg joints","Algorithms;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Female;Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Gravitation;Humans;Leg;Male;Man-Machine Systems;Robotics;Robotics;Therapy, Computer-Assisted;Therapy, Computer-Assisted;Treatment Outcome","78","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To realize the DTN vision, routes must be found over multiple unreliable, intermittently-connected hops. In this paper we present a practical routing protocol that uses only observed information about the network. We designed a metric that estimates the average waiting time for each potential next hop. This learned topology information is distributed using a link-state routing protocol, where the link-state packets are ""flooded"" using epidemic routing. The routing is recomputed each time connections are established, allowing messages to take advantage of unpredictable contacts. A message is forwarded if the topology suggests that the connected node is ""closer"" to the destination than the current node. We demonstrate through simulation that our protocol provides performance similar to that of schemes that have global knowledge of the network topology, yet without requiring that knowledge. Further, it requires significantly less resources than the alternative, epidemic routing, suggesting that our approach scales better with the number of messages in the network. This performance is achieved with minimal protocol overhead for networks of approximately 100 nodes.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2007.1016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4253574","Routing protocols;mobile communication systems;nomadic computing.","Disruption tolerant networking;Routing protocols;Telecommunication network topology;Mobile communication;Delay;Network topology;Relays;Government;Monitoring;Costs","delays;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology","delay-tolerant networks;link-state routing protocol;link-state packets;average waiting time;epidemic routing;network topology;protocol overhead","","155","","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One major challenge, however, is to minimize the interference among these carriers especially on the implantable side, where size and power are highly limited. Planar power coils with spiral shape are optimized in geometry to provide maximum coupling coefficient k. The data coils are designed rectangular in shape and wound across the power coils diameter to be oriented perpendicular to the power coil planes.

The cardinalized PHD (CPHD) recursion is a generalization of the PHD recursion, which jointly propagates the posterior intensity and the posterior cardinality distribution. In general, the CPHD recursion is computationally intractable. This paper proposes a closed-form solution to the CPHD recursion under linear Gaussian assumptions on the target dynamics and birth process. Based on this solution, an effective multitarget tracking algorithm is developed. Extensions of the proposed closed-form recursion to accommodate nonlinear models are also given using linearization and unscented transform techniques. The proposed CPHD implementations not only sidestep the need to perform data association found in traditional methods, but also dramatically improve the accuracy of individual state estimates as well as the variance of the estimated number of targets when compared to the standard PHD filter.

The Medium Frequency Topology is the power electronic solution that considerably reduces weight and losses of the traction system.","","978-92-75815-10-8","10.1109/EPE.2007.4417570","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4417570","Converter circuit;Rail vehicle;Resonant converter;Efficiency;Traction Applications","Rail transportation;Power transformer insulation;Vehicles;Insulated gate bipolar transistors;Voltage;Frequency conversion;DC-DC power converters;DC motors;Circuit topology;Power supplies","power electronics;power transformers;railways","medium frequency topology;railway applications;railway power supply;transformer losses;distribution transformers;power electronics","","133","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to estimate as well as to predict the reliability of software systems, failure data need to be properly measured by various means during software development and operational phases. Moreover, credible software reliability models are required to track underlying software failure processes for accurate reliability analysis and forecasting. Although software reliability has remained an active research subject over the past 35 years, challenges and open questions still exist. In particular, vital future goals include the development of new software reliability engineering paradigms that take software architectures, testing techniques, and software failure manifestation mechanisms into consideration. In this paper, we review the history of software reliability engineering, the current trends and existing problems, and specific difficulties. Possible future directions and promising research subjects in software reliability engineering are also addressed.","","0-7695-2829-5","10.1109/FOSE.2007.24","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221618","","Software reliability;Reliability engineering;Maintenance engineering;Software systems;Software maintenance;Phase estimation;Phase measurement;Software measurement;Programming;Predictive models","program testing;software architecture;software maintenance;software reliability","software reliability engineering;software system development;software system maintenance;software reliability forecasting;software architecture;software testing technique;software failure manifestation mechanism","","114","","52","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The conceived bandwidth enhancement technique demonstrates an impedance bandwidth (SWR les2) of up to 74% which outperforms conventional broadband patch antennas of more than 20%. Meanwhile, by using a differentially-driven signal along with the introduced feeding scheme, symmetric radiation patterns, low cross-polarization levels and stable radiation patterns are realized within the band.

We provide the optimal PA at the source (or the relay) with a node transmit power constraint that maximizes the instantaneous rate for a given relay (or source) PA. Furthermore, we show that repeating this separate optimization of the source and the relay PA alternately converges and improves the achievable rate of the considered link.

Both MRC and equal gain combination (EGC) exhibit significant performance improvement over conventional hard combination. Encouraged by the performance gain of soft combination, we propose a new softened hard combination scheme with two-bit overhead for each user and achieve a good tradeoff between detection performance and complexity.

Organization of images in such a database (DB) is well defined with predefined semantic categories; hence, it can be useful for category-specific searching. The proposed framework consists of machine learning methods for image prefiltering, similarity matching using statistical distance measures, and a relevance feedback (RF) scheme. To narrow down the semantic gap and increase the retrieval efficiency, we investigate both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to associate low-level global image features (e.g., color, texture, and edge) in the projected PCA-based eigenspace with their high-level semantic and visual categories. Specially, we explore the use of a probabilistic multiclass support vector machine (SVM) and fuzzy c-mean (FCM) clustering for categorization and prefiltering of images to reduce the search space. A category-specific statistical similarity matching is proposed in a finer level on the prefiltered images. To incorporate a better perception subjectivity, an RF mechanism is also added to update the query parameters dynamically and adjust the proposed matching functions. Experiments are based on a ground-truth DB consisting of 5000 diverse medical images of 20 predefined categories. Analysis of results based on cross-validation (CV) accuracy and precision-recall for image categorization and retrieval is reported.

The method is also shown to be applicable for approximating the sum of lognormal-Rice and Suzuki RVs by a single lognormal RV. A sum consisting of a mixture of the above distributions can also be easily handled. The method uses the moment generating function (MGF) as a tool in the approximation and does so without the extremely precise numerical computations at a large number of points that were required by the previously proposed methods in the literature. Unlike popular approximation methods such as the Fenton-Wilkinson method and the Schwartz-Yeh method, which have their own respective short-comings, the proposed method provides the parametric flexibility to accurately approximate different portions of the lognormal sum distribution. The accuracy of the method is measured both visually, as has been done in the literature, as well as quantitatively, using curve-fitting metrics. An upper bound on the sensitivity of the method is also provided.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2007.051000","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4275022","","Random variables;Function approximation;Approximation methods;Interchannel interference;Curve fitting;Upper bound;Moment methods;Character generation;Attenuation","curve fitting;log normal distribution;perturbation theory;probability;random processes;wireless channels","probability distribution function;wireless channel;curve-fitting metrics;approximation method;moment generating function;lognormal distribution;random variable","","231","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"A Complete Harmonic Elimination Approach to DC Link Voltage Balancing for a Cascaded Multilevel Rectifier","A. J. Watson; P. W. Wheeler; J. C.

Recently, such converters have been the subject of extensive research due to their suitability for high-power applications. One requirement in using a multilevel active rectifier at high levels of power is to limit the switching losses by reducing the switching frequency to a minimum. Another requirement for these converters is to ensure that individual dc link capacitor voltages for each cell of the converter are always balanced to ensure controllability and to limit stress on the converter cells. This paper presents a complete method in solving both of these problems using a selective-harmonic-elimination pulsewidth-modulation scheme. The scheme utilizes a simple controller to track each cell dc link capacitor voltage magnitude and accordingly biases the power flowing into each cell to ensure that the voltages across each cell capacitor converge. This is the case even when the loads attached to the individual cells are not balanced. The theory is supported by both simulated results from Saber and by experimental results from a seven-level CHB single-phase multilevel rectifier.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2007.906993","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4373444","Multilevel converter;selective harmonic elimination (SHE);voltage balancing control","Rectifiers;Capacitors;Voltage control;Circuit topology;Switching loss;Analog-digital conversion;Switching frequency;Controllability;Stress;Power harmonic filters","harmonics suppression;power conversion harmonics;PWM power convertors;PWM rectifiers","selective-harmonic-elimination pulsewidth-modulation scheme;DC link capacitor voltage magnitude;converter cells;multilevel active rectifier;single-phase CHB rectifier;cascaded H-Bridge multilevel rectifier;DC link voltage balancing;complete harmonic elimination approach","","103","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"A Fast Image Super-Resolution Algorithm Using an Adaptive Wiener Filter","R. Hardie","Dayton Univ., Dayton","IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","","2007","16","12","2953","2964","A computationally simple super-resolution algorithm using a type of adaptive Wiener filter is proposed. The algorithm produces an improved resolution image from a sequence of low-resolution (LR) video frames with overlapping field of view. The algorithm uses subpixel registration to position each LR pixel value on a common spatial grid that is referenced to the average position of the input frames. The positions of the LR pixels are not quantized to a finite grid as with some previous techniques. The output high-resolution (HR) pixels are obtained using a weighted sum of LR pixels in a local moving window. Using a statistical model, the weights for each HR pixel are designed to minimize the mean squared error and they depend on the relative positions of the surrounding LR pixels. Thus, these weights adapt spatially and temporally to changing distributions of LR pixels due to varying motion. Both a global and spatially varying statistical model are considered here. Since the weights adapt with distribution of LR pixels, it is quite robust and will not become unstable when an unfavorable distribution of LR pixels is observed. For translational motion, the algorithm has a low computational complexity and may be readily suitable for real-time and/or near real-time processing applications. With other motion models, the computational complexity goes up significantly. However, regardless of the motion model, the algorithm lends itself to parallel implementation. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated here in a number of experimental results using simulated and real video sequences. A computational analysis is also presented.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2007.909416","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4376249","Aliasing;image restoration;super resolution;undersampling;video processing","Image resolution;Wiener filter;Spatial resolution;Strontium;Detectors;Optical imaging;Optical noise;Computational complexity;Computational modeling;Video sequences","adaptive filters;image motion analysis;image resolution;mean square error methods;statistical analysis;Wiener filters","image super-resolution algorithm;adaptive Wiener filter;subpixel registration;mean squared error;statistical model;translational motion","Algorithms;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Video Recording","90","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Precise orthorectification is obtained owing to an optimized model of the imaging system, where look directions are linearly corrected to compensate for attitude drifts, and sensor orientation uncertainties are accounted for. We introduce a new computation of the inverse projection matrices for which a rigorous resampling is proposed. The irregular resampling problem is explicitly addressed to avoid introducing aliasing in the ortho-rectified images. Image registration and correlation is achieved with a new iterative unbiased processor that estimates the phase plane in the Fourier domain for subpixel shift detection. Without using supplementary data, raw images are wrapped onto the digital elevation model and coregistered with a 1/50 pixel accuracy. The procedure applies to images from any pushbroom imaging system.

To achieve good tracking capability, this paper proposes a path following approach based on a fuzzy-logic set of rules which emulates the human driving behavior. The input to the fuzzy system is represented by approximate information concerning the next bend ahead the vehicle; the corresponding output is the cruise velocity that the vehicle needs to attain in order to safely drive on the path.

This research is motivated in part by the potential application of speaker recognition technologies on handheld devices or the Internet. While the technologies promise an additional biometric layer of security to protect the user, the practical implementation of such systems faces many challenges. One of these is environmental noise. Due to the mobile nature of such systems, the noise sources can be highly time-varying and potentially unknown. This raises the requirement for noise robustness in the absence of information about the noise. This paper describes a method that combines multicondition model training and missing-feature theory to model noise with unknown temporal-spectral characteristics. Multicondition training is conducted using simulated noisy data with limited noise variation, providing a ldquocoarserdquo compensation for the noise, and missing-feature theory is applied to refine the compensation by ignoring noise variation outside the given training conditions, thereby reducing the training and testing mismatch. This paper is focused on several issues relating to the implementation of the new model for real-world applications. These include the generation of multicondition training data to model noisy speech, the combination of different training data to optimize the recognition performance, and the reduction of the model's complexity. The new algorithm was tested using two databases with simulated and realistic noisy speech data. The first database is a redevelopment of the TIMIT database by rerecording the data in the presence of various noise types, used to test the model for speaker identification with a focus on the varieties of noise. The second database is a handheld-device database collected in realistic noisy conditions, used to further validate the model for real-world speaker verification. The new model is compared to baseline systems and is found to achieve lower error rates.","1558-7924","","10.1109/TASL.2007.899278","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4244529","Missing-feature theory;multicondition training;noise compensation;noise modeling;speaker recognition","Speaker recognition;Working environment noise;Noise reduction;Databases;Testing;Noise robustness;Training data;Speech enhancement;Signal processing;Handheld computers","acoustic noise;speaker recognition","temporal-spectral characteristics;missing-feature theory;multicondition model training;speech signals;speaker verification;speaker identification;noisy conditions;robust speaker recognition","","140","","51","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Canonical correlations offer many benefits in accuracy, efficiency, and robustness compared to the two main classical methods: parametric distribution-based and nonparametric sample-based matching of sets. Here, this is first demonstrated experimentally for reasonably sized data sets using existing methods exploiting canonical correlations. Motivated by their proven effectiveness, a novel discriminative learning method over sets is proposed for set classification. Specifically, inspired by classical linear discriminant analysis (LDA), we develop a linear discriminant function that maximizes the canonical correlations of within-class sets and minimizes the canonical correlations of between-class sets. Image sets transformed by the discriminant function are then compared by the canonical correlations. Classical orthogonal subspace method (OSM) is also investigated for the similar purpose and compared with the proposed method. The proposed method is evaluated on various object recognition problems using face image sets with arbitrary motion captured under different illuminations and image sets of 500 general objects taken at different views. The method is also applied to object category recognition using ETH-80 database.

The PCS consists of a zero-ripple boost converter (ZRBC) followed by a soft-switched and multilevel high-frequency (HF) inverter and a single-phase cycloconverter. The ZRBC comprises a new zero-ripple filter (ZRF), which significantly reduces the input low- and high-frequency current ripples, thereby potentially enhancing the durability of the stack. A new phase-shifted sinewave modulation of the multilevel HF inverter is proposed, which results in the zero-voltage switching (ZVS) of all four switches without the use of any auxiliary circuit components. For such a sine wave modulation technique, >90% ZVS range is obtained per line cycle for about 70% of the rated load. Further, the line-frequency switching of the cycloconverter (at close to unity power factor) results in extremely low switching losses. The intermediate dc bus facilitates the inclusion of power systems based on other forms of alternative-energy techniques (e.g., photovoltaic/high-voltage stack). A 5 kW prototype of the proposed PCS is built, which currently achieves a peak efficiency of 92.4%.

"Reducing the Peak-to-Average Power Ratio of OFDM Signals Through Precoding","S. B. Slimane","Dept. of Commun. Syst., R. Inst. of Technol., Stockholm","IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","","2007","56","2","686","695","Orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) techniques allow the transmission of high data rates over broadband radio channels subject to multipath fading without the need for powerful channel equalization. However, they are very sensitive to nonlinear effects due to the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) owned by their transmitted signals. This paper proposes an efficient technique for reducing the PAPR of OFDM signals. The proposed technique is data-independent and, thus, does not require new processing and optimization for each transmitted OFDM block. The reduction in PAPR of the OFDM signal is obtained through a proper selection of a precoding scheme that distributes the power of each modulated symbol over the OFDM block. The obtained results show that this precoding scheme is an attractive solution to the PAPR problem of OFDM signals. It is shown, through computer simulations, that the PAPR of precoded OFDM signals approaches that of single-carrier signals. The good improvement in PAPR given by the present technique permits the reduction of the complexity and cost of the transmitter significantly. The precoding schemes also take advantage of the frequency variations of the communication channel and can provide considerable performance gain in fading-multipath channels","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2007.891409","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4138047","Bandwidth efficiency;diversity gain;fading multipath;low complexity;orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM);peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR);power efficiency;precoding","Peak to average power ratio;Fading;Radio transmitters;Degradation;OFDM modulation;Computer simulation;Costs;Communication channels;Performance gain;Diversity methods","broadband networks;equalisers;fading channels;multipath channels;OFDM modulation;precoding","peak-to-average power ratio;OFDM signals;orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing technique;broadband radio channels;multipath fading channel;communication channel equalization","","144","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Development of a Comprehensive Model and a Multiloop Controller for $Z$-Source Inverter DG Systems","C. J. Gajanayake; D. M. Vilathgamuwa; P. C. Loh","NA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","","2007","54","4","2352","2359","This paper presents the modeling and design of a closed-loop controller for a Z-source inverter. The Z-source inverter is a recently proposed single-stage power converter, and it is capable of operating in both buck and boost modes. Hence, this inverter gives an economical solution for power conversion in distributed generation (DG) applications, particularly by eliminating the need for a two-stage conversion. Moreover, applications such as DG demand quality output waveforms, and additionally, when the system is subjected to input- and load-side disturbances, their effects need to be minimized. This can be achieved with closed-loop controlling. Toward this end, the system is modeled first with large- and small-signal modeling techniques, and relevant transfer functions are derived. The dc-side of the Z-source inverter shows a non-minimum-phase characteristic, and the output voltage of a Z-source impedance network shows a significant overshoot and undershoot, following a step change in the input due to energy resettling. These effects could be transferred to the ac-side, giving rise to the undershoot and overshoot in the ac output as well. Hence, the proposed controllers should be able to minimize such effects. The ac- and dc-sides are considered separately when designing the controllers. An indirect controller is employed in the dc-side, whereas the ac-side controller is designed in the synchronous reference frame. The modulation index, shoot-through time, and saturation levels are appropriately selected so that the dc-side effects are prevented from propagating into the ac-side. The simulation results are obtained using a state-space-averaged inverter model, and an experimental prototype is built in a laboratory to prove the efficacy of the proposed algorithm. Simulation and experimental results show good reference-tracking and disturbance-rejection properties, validating the desired functionality of the proposed controller.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2007.894772","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4280921","Buck–boost;distributed generation (DG);inverters;small-signal analysis;$Z$ -source inverters","Inverters;Power system modeling;Power system economics;Power generation economics;Power conversion;Distributed control;Transfer functions;Voltage;Impedance;Modulation","closed loop systems;control system synthesis;distributed power generation;invertors;power distribution control;power generation control;transfer functions","multiloop controller;Z-source inverter DG Systems;closed-loop controller design;closed-loop controller modeling;single-stage power converter;power conversion;distributed generation applications;load-side disturbances;small-signal modeling techniques;large-small-signal modeling techniques;transfer functions;Z-source impedance network;synchronous reference frame;modulation index;shoot-through time;saturation levels","","127","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We outline a system, PipeNet, we have been developing for collecting hydraulic and acoustic/vibration data at high sampling rates as well as algorithms for analyzing this data to detect and locate leaks. Challenges include sampling at high data rates, maintaining aggressive duty cycles, and ensuring tightly time- synchronized data collection, all under a strict power budget.

In this tutorial we present the importance of low power microprocessor/SOC design from the high level microarchitectural, RTL, gate level to transistor level design. We cover the conflicting goals of performance vs low power, routinely faced by designers today. Embedded microprocessor/SOC designs are particularly dictated by standby and max/thermal design power and battery life constraints and not performance/frequency alone. Designing with the power envelope is a standard challenge even for the high end server platforms. Performance/watt or MlPS/watt is the design metric of today that we focus on. We cover the main components of leakage power and how does the transistor design determines whether the extreme stringent battery life requirements determined by standby and average power are met. A short discussion of different process variants for various types of applications will also be discussed followed by an introduction of shadow latches and state retention techniques used by microprocessors and DSPs of today. Tradeoff between amount of state retained and the exit latency of the processor from deep sleep/standby states will be discussed.

North America, Briarcliff Manor","2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","","2007","","","147","157","A number of algorithmic and protocol assumptions taken for granted in the design of existing wireless communication technologies need to be revisited in extending their scope to the new cognitive radio (CR) paradigm. The fact that channel availability can rapidly change over time and the need for coordinated quiet periods in order to quickly and robustly detect the presence of incumbents, are just some of the examples of the unique challenges in protocol and algorithm design for CR networks and, in particular, in the medium access control (MAC) layer. With this in mind, in this paper we introduce a novel cognitive MAC (C-MAC) protocol for distributed multi-channel wireless networks. C-MAC operates over multiple channels, and hence is able to effectively deal with, among other things, the dynamics of resource availability due to primary users and mitigate the effects of distributed quiet periods utilized for primary user signal detection. In C-MAC, each channel is logically divided into recurring superframes which, in turn, include a slotted beaconing period (BP) where nodes exchange information and negotiate channel usage. Each node transmits a beacon in a designated beacon slot during the BP, which helps in dealing with hidden nodes, medium reservations, and mobility. For coordination amongst nodes in different channels, a rendezvous channel (RC) is employed that is decided dynamically and in a totally distributed fashion. Among other things, the RC is used to support network-wide multicast and broadcast which are often neglected in existing multi-channel MAC protocols. We present promising performance results of C- MAC. We also describe our efforts to implement features of C- MAC in a real CR prototype with Atheros chipset, which currently includes the spectrum sensing module and preliminary features of C-MAC.","","1-4244-0663-3","10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.27","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221489","","Media Access Protocol;Wireless application protocol;Wireless networks;Chromium;Algorithm design and analysis;Access protocols;Multicast protocols;Wireless communication;Communications technology;Cognitive radio","access protocols;cognitive radio;wireless channels","cognitive medium access control protocol;distributed multichannel wireless network;slotted beaconing period","","254","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The delivery of the science in these extreme environments is a challenge, and the missions require unique approaches. MESSENGER'S antenna system utilizes the first electronically scanned high-gain array for a deep-space telecommunication application. The array, which provides the high-data-rate downlink, is scanned in one dimension and is circularly polarized. Although a linearly polarized array would have satisfied the minimum mission science data rate requirements, MESSENGER'S circularly polarized array doubles it. To achieve this, the Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) developed an innovative technique to produce circular polarization from a narrow-wall slotted waveguide array. The new technique uses short parasitic monopoles mounted to the exterior of the waveguides. The result is a simple, lightweight, and all-metal circularly polarized array capable of operating at +300 OC, and a variety of measurement techniques were used to verify phased-array antenna system performance during qualification. The NH antenna system is a stack arrangement of a high-gain antenna (HGA), medium-gain antenna (MGA), and low-gain antenna (LGA). To minimize mission operating costs, the spacecraft is spin stabilized at all times except during encounters to maintain a fixed spacecraft attitude. This approach and application for a narrow beamwidth antenna is unique for a deep-space mission, resulting in new approaches to accurately measure the gain and radio-frequency (RF) boresight direction in a compact range facility. Because of the importance of the HGA function to overall mission success, testing of the HGA system at operational temperatures of -200 OC was also performed. Recent in-flight measurement of the NH HGA pattern verified ground alignments. The RF design of the NH antenna also forms the baseline RF design for a deployable antenna system JHU/APL is developing called the Hybrid Deployable Antenna (HDA). The HDA combines a fixed parabolic dish with a deployable/inflatable reflector annulus that greatly increases antenna area after launch. This concept provides a high-payoff deployable antenna system that is being developed to address the ""all or nothing"" risk by providing a viable backup capability.

However, a localization system based on RFID technology inevitably suffers from an estimation error. In this paper, a new triangular pattern of arranging the RFID tags on the floor has been proposed to reduce the estimation error of the conventional square pattern. In addition, the motion-continuity property of the differential-driving mobile robot has been utilized to improve the localization accuracy of the mobile robot. According to the conventional approach, two readers are necessary to identify the orientation of the mobile robot. Therefore, this new approach, based on the motion-continuity property of the differential-driving mobile robot, provides a cheap and fast estimation of the orientation.

Output phase voltages of the MLID are used as diagnostic signals to detect faults and their locations. It is difficult to diagnose an MLID system using a mathematical model because MLID systems consist of many switching devices and their system complexity has a nonlinear factor. Therefore, a neural network (NN) classification is applied to the fault diagnosis of an MLID system. Multilayer perceptron networks are used to identify the type and location of occurring faults. The principal component analysis is utilized in the feature extraction process to reduce the NN input size. A lower dimensional input space will also usually reduce the time necessary to train an NN, and the reduced noise can improve the mapping performance. The genetic algorithm is also applied to select the valuable principal components. The proposed network is evaluated with simulation test set and experimental test set. The overall classification performance of the proposed network is more than 95%. A reconfiguration technique is also proposed. The proposed fault diagnostic system requires about six cycles to clear an open-circuit or short-circuit fault.

We developed new and very effective techniques for automatic writer identification and verification that use probability distribution functions (PDFs) extracted from the handwriting images to characterize writer individuality. A defining property of our methods is that they are designed to be independent of the textual content of the handwritten samples. Our methods operate at two levels of analysis: the texture level and the character-shape (allograph) level. At the texture level, we use contour-based joint directional PDFs that encode orientation and curvature information to give an intimate characterization of individual handwriting style. In our analysis at the allograph level, the writer is considered to be characterized by a stochastic pattern generator of ink-trace fragments, or graphemes. The PDF of these simple shapes in a given handwriting sample is characteristic for the writer and is computed using a common shape codebook obtained by grapheme clustering. Combining multiple features (directional, grapheme, and run-length PDFs) yields increased writer identification and verification performance. The proposed methods are applicable to free-style handwriting (both cursive and isolated) and have practical feasibility, under the assumption that a few text lines of handwritten material are available in order to obtain reliable probability estimates","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4107573","Handwriting analysis;writer identification and verification;behavioral biometrics;joint directional probability distributions;grapheme-emission probability distribution.","Biometrics;Shape;Forensics;Text analysis;Image analysis;Probability distribution;Image texture analysis;Pattern analysis;Stochastic processes;Character generation","handwriting recognition;pattern clustering;statistical distributions;text analysis","text-independent writer identification;textural features;allographic features;person identification;handwriting images;biometric modality;forensic document analysis;historic document analysis;behavioral biometrics;automatic writer identification;probability distribution functions;texture level analysis;character-shape analysis;contour-based joint directional PDF;curvature information;stochastic pattern generator;ink-trace fragments;common shape codebook;grapheme clustering;free-style handwriting","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Automatic Data Processing;Biometry;Handwriting;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique;User-Computer Interface","270","","62","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the increasing demand for wireless communication, efficiently using the spectrum resource has become an essential issue. With the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) spectrum policy reform, secondary spectrum sharing has gained increasing interest. One of the policy reforms introduces the concept of an interference temperature - the total allowable interference in a spectral band. This means that secondary users can use different transmit powers as long as the sum of these power is less than the interference threshold. In this paper, we study two problems in secondary spectrum access with minimum signal to interference noise ratio (quality of service (QoS)) guarantee under an interference temperature constraint. First, when all the secondary links can be supported, a nonlinear optimization problem with the objective to maximize the total transmitting rate of the secondary users is formulated. The nonlinear optimization is solved efficiently using geometric programming techniques. The second problem we address is, when not all the secondary links can be supported with their QoS requirement, it is desirable to have the spectrum access opportunity proportional to the user priority if they belong to different priority classes. In this context, we formulate an operator problem which takes the priority issues into consideration. To solve this problem, first, we propose a centralized reduced complexity search algorithm to find the optimal solution. Then, in order to solve this problem distributively, we define a secondary spectrum sharing potential game. The Nash equilibria of this potential game are investigated. The efficiency of the Nash equilibria solutions are characterized. It is shown that distributed sequential play and an algorithm based on stochastic learning attain the equilibrium solutions.

A method based on 2-D seriate images by which statistical data of a badminton match can be obtained is presented. Image capture and analysis were performed synchronously using a multithreading technique. The regions of movement in the images were detected using a temporal difference method, and the trajectories of the movement regions were analyzed using seriate images. The shuttlecock trajectory was extracted from all detected trajectories using various characteristic parameters. The stroke type was determined by comparing the shuttlecock trajectory data with a set of stroke definition data. The algorithm was tested at a training center, and the results were compared with baseline data obtained by expert visual inspection using four video samples, which included approximately 10 000 frames.

Simplified by the proposed method, the conventional SVPWM is decomposed into fast integer operations entirely by using an intermediate vector, which will properly counteract the redundant calculations of the remaining procedures. This concept can not only simplify a two-level scheme, but is also suited for multilevel implementation. Since it can be implemented without any multiplier or divider, the fast algorithm is especially suitable for field programmable gate array applications. Then, an area- and speed-efficient IP-core based on this algorithm is built and tested. It ensures lower hardware resource usage, and at the same time, operates several times faster than some reported examples.

The designed Z-source NPC inverter uses two unique X-shaped inductance-capacitance (LC) impedance networks that are connected between two isolated dc input power sources and its inverter circuitry for boosting its AC output voltage. Through the design of an appropriate pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) algorithm, the two impedance networks can be short-circuited sequentially (without shooting through the inverter full DC link) for implementing the ldquonearest-three-vectorrdquo modulation principle with minimized harmonic distortion and device commutations per half carrier cycle while performing voltage boosting. With only a slight modification to the inverter PWM algorithm and by short-circuiting the two impedance networks simultaneously, the designed NPC inverter, with no requirement for deadtime delay, can also be operated with a completely eliminated common-mode voltage. Implementation wise, a detailed vectorial analysis interestingly shows that the same generic set of carrier-based modulation expressions can be used for controlling the -source two-level inverter and NPC inverter with and without reduced common-mode switching.

When expressed in terms of Debye parameters, dispersive breast tissue dielectric properties can be efficiently incorporated into FDTD codes. Previously, we experimentally characterized the dielectric properties of a large number of excised normal and malignant breast tissue samples from 0.5 to 20 GHz. We subdivided the large database of normal tissue data into three groups based on the percent adipose tissue present in a particular sample. In addition, we formed a group of all cancer samples that contained at least 30% malignant tissue. We summarized the data using one-pole Cole-Cole models that were rigorously fit to the median dielectric properties of the three normal tissue groups and one malignant tissue group. In this letter, we present computationally simpler one- and two-pole Debye models that retain the high accuracy of the Cole-Cole models. Model parameters are derived for two sets of frequency ranges: the entire measurement frequency range from 0.5 to 20 GHz, and the 3.1-10.6 GHz FCC band allocated for ultrawideband medical applications.

The tremendous benefits of the switching operations in power electronics came into the public domain following the introduction of the thyratron. The theory of phase control was well advanced by the time the SCR became available. Although phase control circuit theory was widely known, the complexity of those circuits and the fragile nature of the rectifier devices greatly restricted practical applications of phase control.

"A Supervised Feature-Projection-Based Real-Time EMG Pattern Recognition for Multifunction Myoelectric Hand Control","J. Chu; I. Moon; Y. Lee; S. Kim; M. Mun","Kyungpook Nat.

The main goal of this study was to develop an efficient feature- projection method for EMG pattern recognition. To this end, a linear supervised feature projection is proposed that utilizes a linear discriminant analysis (LDA). First, a wavelet packet transform (WPT) is performed to extract a feature vector from four-channel EMG signals. To dimensionally reduce and cluster the WPT features, an LDA, then, incorporates class information into the learning procedure, and identifies a linear matrix to maximize the class separability for the projected features. Finally, a multilayer perceptron classifies the LDA-reduced features into nine hand motions. To evaluate the performance of the LDA for WPT features, the LDA is compared with three other feature-projection methods. From a visualization and quantitative comparison, it is shown that the LDA produces a better performance for the class separability, plus the LDA-projected features improve the classification accuracy with a short processing time. A real-time pattern-recognition system is then implemented for a multifunction myoelectric hand. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves a 97.4% recognition accuracy, and all processes, including the generation of control commands for the myoelectric hand, are completed within 97 ms. Consequently, these results confirm that the proposed method is applicable to real-time EMG pattern recognition for multifunction myoelectric hand control.","1941-014X","","10.1109/TMECH.2007.897262","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4244373","Electromyographic (EMG);linear discriminant analysis (LDA);myoelectric hand control;pattern recognition;wavelet packet transform (WPT)","Electromyography;Pattern recognition;Linear discriminant analysis;Wavelet packets;Wavelet transforms;Data mining;Feature extraction;Vectors;Multilayer perceptrons;Visualization","electromyography;feature extraction;linear matrix inequalities;medical signal processing;multilayer perceptrons;wavelet transforms","real-time pattern-recognition system;multilayer perceptron;linear matrix;four-channel EMG signals;feature vector extraction;wavelet packet transform;linear discriminant analysis;linear supervised feature projection;feature-projection method;multifunction myoelectric hand;electromyographic pattern recognition","","154","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the use of the transmission line architecture and the position-dependent amplitude of the standing waves, the loading effects of the varactors and the MOS switches can be alleviated, enabling the VCO to operate at higher frequencies.

At the early stage of a DDoS attack, some traffic fluctuations are detectable at Internet routers or at the gateways of edge networks. We develop a distributed change-point detection (DCD) architecture using change aggregation trees (CAT). The idea is to detect abrupt traffic changes across multiple network domains at the earliest time. Early detection of DDoS attacks minimizes the floe cling damages to the victim systems serviced by the provider. The system is built over attack-transit routers, which work together cooperatively. Each ISP domain has a CAT server to aggregate the flooding alerts reported by the routers. CAT domain servers collaborate among themselves to make the final decision. To resolve policy conflicts at different ISP domains, a new secure infrastructure protocol (SIP) is developed to establish mutual trust or consensus. We simulated the DCD system up to 16 network domains on the Cyber Defense Technology Experimental Research (DETER) testbed, a 220-node PC cluster for Internet emulation experiments at the University of Southern California (USC) Information Science Institute. Experimental results show that four network domains are sufficient to yield a 98 percent detection accuracy with only 1 percent false-positive alarms. Based on a 2006 Internet report on autonomous system (AS) domain distribution, we prove that this DDoS defense system can scale well to cover 84 AS domains. This security coverage is wide enough to safeguard most ISP core networks from real-life DDoS flooding attacks.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2007.1111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359399","Cyber defense;network security;DDoS attacks;Internet technology;Cyber defense;network security;DDoS attacks;Internet technology","Collaboration;Computer crime;Telecommunication traffic;IP networks;Network servers;Web and internet services;Fluctuations;Aggregates;Floods;Collaborative work","Internet;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","collaborative detection;multiple network domains;distributed denial of services attacks;Internet service providers;distributed change-point detection architecture;channel aggregation trees;secure infrastructure protocol;Cyber Defense Technology Experimental Research testbed;University of Southern California Information Science Institute;autonomous system domain distribution;cyber defense;network security","","110","","43","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditionally, this problem has been tackled using a ldquodivide and conquerrdquo approach. The latter consists in deploying the network with a static or semidynamic pattern of resource reutilization. The chosen reuse factor, while sacrificing a substantial amount of efficiency, brings the interference to a tolerable level. The resource can then be managed in each cell so as to optimize the per cell capacity using an advanced air interface design. In this paper, we focus our attention on the overall network capacity as a measure of system performance. We consider the problem of resource allocation and adaptive transmission in multicell scenarios. As a key instance, the problem of joint scheduling and power control simultaneously in multiple transmit-receive links, which employ capacity-achieving adaptive codes, is studied. In principle, the solution of such an optimization hinges on tough issues such as the computational complexity and the requirement for heavy receiver-to-transmitter feedback and, for cellular networks, cell-to-cell channel state information (CSI) signaling. We give asymptotic properties pertaining to rate-maximizing power control and scheduling in multicell networks.

Existing methods can suffer from a lack of global stability, a lack of tracking accuracy, or a dependence on smooth road surfaces, any one of which could lead to the loss of the vehicle in autonomous off-road driving. This work treats automobile trajectory tracking in a new manner, by considering the orientation of the front wheels - not the vehicle's body - with respect to the desired trajectory, enabling collocated control of the system. A steering control law is designed using the kinematic equations of motion, for which global asymptotic stability is proven. This control law is then augmented to handle the dynamics of pneumatic tires and of the servo-actuated steering wheel. To control vehicle speed, the brake and throttle are actuated by a switching proportional integral (PI) controller.

They consist of on-off current controllers, proportional-integral current controller, and predictive current controller. The quality of the regulated current is significantly improved. It is mainly due to a very important reduction of the execution time delay. Indeed, in all described techniques, the execution time of the designed hardware architectures is only a few microseconds. This time reduction derives directly from the possibility offered by FPGAs to design very powerful dedicated architectures.

The classification system is a supervised classification system that is based on features extracted from the intercepted radar signal. A large set of potential features are presented.

Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are self-organized networks built up from moving vehicles, and are part of the broader class of mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs). Because of their peculiar characteristics, VANETs require the definition of specific networking techniques, whose feasibility and performance are usually tested by means of simulation. One of the main challenges posed by VANETs simulations is the faithful characterization of vehicular mobility at both macroscopic and microscopic levels, leading to realistic non-uniform distributions of cars and velocity, and unique connectivity dynamics.

Traditional array design is based on designing an isolated element with the desired bandwidth and radiation characteristics and does not account for the mutual coupling that occurs when this element is placed in an array environment. It is well known that undesired mutual coupling in an array can cause dramatic changes in antenna element impedance and radiation patterns. Harris' new approach treats the array aperture as a periodic surface so that the performance of elements within the array environment is assured. The approach is similar to that used to design a frequency selective surface, another periodic, highly-coupled structure. The resultant array apertures are inherently low-profile in cross-section, amenable to conformal implementations, and are able to maintain efficient characteristics over large scan volumes with bandwidths approaching a decade. This paper will present an introduction to this design methodology supported by predicted and measured results from several array designs.","2155-7586","978-1-4244-1512-0","10.1109/MILCOM.2007.4454764","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4454764","","Bandwidth;Mutual coupling;Apertures;Hardware;Antenna arrays;Surface impedance;Antenna radiation patterns;Surface treatment;Frequency selective surfaces;Periodic structures","","","","50","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Growing popularity of botnets compels to find proper countermeasures but existing defense mechanisms hardly catch up with the speed of botnet technologies. In this paper, we propose a botnet detection mechanism by monitoring DNS traffic to detect botnets, which form a group activity in DNS queries simultaneously sent by distributed bots. A few works have been proposed based on particular DNS information generated by a botnet, but they are easily evaded by changing bot programs. Our anomaly-based botnet detection mechanism is more robust than the previous approaches so that the variants of bots can be detectable by looking at their group activities in DNS traffic. From the experiments on a campus network, it is shown that the proposed mechanism can detect botnets effectively while bots are connecting to their server or migrating to another server.","","978-0-7695-2983-7","10.1109/CIT.2007.90","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4385169","","Computer crime;Network servers;Web server;Internet;Communication system control;Discussion forums;Information technology;Computerized monitoring;Robots;Electronic mail","security of data;software engineering;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;unsolicited e-mail","botnet detection;group activities monitoring;DNS traffic;software robots;spam mails;DDoS attacks","","106","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These sensors are robust and easy to use without compromising noise performance. They are optimized for operation with our high-speed direct-coupled flux-locked loop (FLL) electronics XXF-1. For the readout of cryogenic detectors, series arrays of 16 SQUIDs with 3 nH input inductance were designed which can be cooled down and operated in the Earth's field without magnetic shield. A compact gradiometric design allows the chips to be mounted directly on a Cu block at the cold stage of a mK cryostat without degradation in noise. A current noise level of 9 or 5 is achieved at 4.2 K or 300 mK, respectively. Ultra-high-speed operation was demonstrated by using a cold FLL electronics prototype in close proximity to the SQUID array. An extremely high FLL bandwidth of 350 MHz was achieved which outperforms any flux-locked SQUID before by more than an order of magnitude. For applications requiring a larger input inductance of up to 2 , integrated two-stage sensors were developed consisting of a single front-end SQUID with double-transformer coupling read out by a 16-SQUID array. These sensors are very convenient to use as their voltage-flux characteristic is essentially single-SQUID-like. Devices optimized for 4.2 K operation have a coupled energy resolution around 50 times Planck's constant . Heavily shunted devices for low-temperature operation typically achieve 80 or 8 at 4.2 K or 300 mK, respectively. An optional current limiter (Q-spoiler) at the input reduces the input current in pulsed applications like nuclear magnetic resonance or magnetorelaxometry. Integrated rf filters and resistor-capacitor shunts across the input coil result in smooth, well-behaved voltage-flux characteristics even at low temperatures 4.2 K. For magnetic field sensing applications, integrated miniature multiloop magnetometers were designed with maximized field resolution. For a 3 mm 3 mm chip size, a noise level of 3.6 is obtained at 4.2 K.","1558-2515","","10.1109/TASC.2007.897403","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4277368","Current sensor;magnetometer;series SQUID array;two-stage SQUID","SQUIDs;Sensor arrays;Superconducting device noise;Frequency locked loops;Magnetic noise;Inductance;Noise level;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Voltage;Magnetic separation","cryogenic electronics;current limiters;frequency locked loops;inductance;magnetic sensors;noise;nuclear magnetic resonance;radiofrequency filters;sensor arrays;SQUID magnetometers;superconducting filters;superconducting integrated circuits;superconducting transformers","SQUID sensors;low-noise superconducting quantum interference devices;cryogenic detectors;input inductance;compact gradiometric design;current noise level;cold FLL electronics prototype;SQUIDs series arrays;double-transformer coupling read out;integrated two-stage sensors;voltage-flux characteristic;Planck constant;coupled energy resolution;current limiter;nuclear magnetic resonance;magnetorelaxometry;integrated rf filters;resistor-capacitor shunts;magnetic field sensing;integrated miniature multiloop magnetometers;high-speed direct-coupled flux-locked loop electronics;temperature 4.2 K;temperature 300 mK","","189","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The components are then reconstructed by applying the inverse wavelet transform. After the separation of m-D features from the target's original radar return, time-frequency analysis is then used to estimate the target's motion parameters. The autocorrelation of the time sequence data is also used to measure motion parameters such as the vibration/rotation rate. The findings show that the results have higher precision after the m-D extraction rather than before it, since only the vibrational/rotational components are employed.

If the radar cross section (RCS) of the vehicles is strong enough, they can be detected in the SAR data, and their speed can be measured. For system performance prediction and algorithm development, it is therefore indispensable to know the RCS of typical passenger cars. The geometry parameters that have to be considered are the radar look direction, incidence angle, and vehicle orientation. In this letter, the radar signatures of nonmoving or parking cars are presented. They are measured experimentally from airborne experimental SAR (E-SAR) data, which have been collected during flight campaigns in 2005 and 2006 with multiple overflights at different aircraft headings. The radar signatures could be measured for the whole range of aspect angles from 0 to 180 and with high angular resolution due to the large synthetic aperture length of the E-SAR radar sensor. The analysis for one type of passenger car and particular incidence angles showed that the largest radar cross-sectional values and, thus, the greatest chance of detection of the vehicles appear when the car is seen from the front, back, and side. Radar cross-sectional values for slanted views are much lower and are therefore less suitable for car detection. The measurements have been performed in the -band (9.6 GHz) with VV-polarization, and at incidence angles of 41.5deg and 42.5deg. The derived radar signature profile can also be used for the verification of radar cross-sectional simulation studies.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2007.903074","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4317541","Airborne experimental synthetic aperture radar (E-SAR) sensor;aspect angle;look processing;radar cross section (RCS);road vehicles;traffic monitoring","Radar cross section;Synthetic aperture radar;Radar detection;Vehicle detection;Vehicles;Radar measurements;Radar antennas;Radar imaging;Satellites;Image resolution","airborne radar;geophysical techniques;object detection;radar cross-sections;radar detection;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;road traffic;road vehicles;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar","radar signature;passenger car;synthetic aperture radar;TerraSAR-X satellite;Radarsat-2 satellite;spatial image resolution;dual receive antenna;traffic monitoring;radar cross section;radar look direction;incidence angle;vehicle orientation;airborne experimental SAR data;angular resolution;vehicle detection;road vehicles;frequency 9.6 GHz","","19","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we will propose an example-based algorithm for moving vehicle detection. Different from previous works, this algorithm learns from examples and does not rely on any a priori model for vehicles. First, a novel scheme for adaptive background estimation is introduced. Then, the image is divided into many small nonoverlapped blocks. The candidates of the vehicle part can be found from the blocks if there is some change in gray level between the current image and the background.

The road detection step is based on shape classification of a local homogeneous region around a pixel. The local homogeneous region is enclosed by a polygon, called the footprint of the pixel. This step involves detecting road footprints, tracking roads, and growing a road tree. We use a spoke wheel operator to obtain the road footprint. We propose an automatic road seeding method based on rectangular approximations to road footprints and a toe-finding algorithm to classify footprints for growing a road tree. The road tree pruning step makes use of a Bayes decision model based on the area-to-perimeter ratio (the A/P ratio) of the footprint to prune the paths that leak into the surroundings. We introduce a lognormal distribution to characterize the conditional probability of A/P ratios of the footprints in the road tree and present an automatic method to estimate the parameters that are related to the Bayes decision model. Results are presented for various aerial images. Evaluation of the extracted road networks using representative aerial images shows that the completeness of our road tracker ranges from 84% to 94%, correctness is above 81%, and quality is from 82% to 92%.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2007.906107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4378557","Bayes decision rule;road extraction;road footprint;road tracking;road tree pruning","Roads;Image segmentation;Geographic Information Systems;Leak detection;Shape;Wheels;Classification tree analysis;Parameter estimation;Urban areas","Bayes methods;geophysical signal processing;image classification;roads;terrain mapping","road network extraction;intersection detection;aerial image;road footprint tracking;shape classification;road tree;automatic road seeding method;toe-finding algorithm;Bayes decision model;area-to-perimeter ratio","","175","","43","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Proposed are 2.4-GHz low-power transceiver analog front-end circuits for bidirectional high data rate wireless telemetry in medical endoscopy applications. The prototype integrates a low-IF receiver analog front-end [low noise amplifier (LNA), double balanced down-converter, bandpass-filtered automatic gain controlled (AGC) loop and amplitude-shift keying (ASK) demodulator], and a direct up-conversion transmitter analog front-end [20-MHz IF phase-locked loop (PLL) with well-defined amplitude control circuit, ASK modulator, up-converter, and power amplifier] on a single chip together with an internal radio frequency oscillator and local oscillating (LO) buffers. Design tradeoffs have been made over the boundaries of the different building blocks to optimize the overall system performance. All building blocks feature circuit topologies that enable comfortable operation at low power consumption. The circuits have been implemented in a 0.25-mum CMOS process. The measured sensitivity of the receiver analog front-end is -70 dBm with a data rate of 256 kbps, and the measured output power of the transmitter analog front-end could achieve -23 dBm with a data rate of 1 Mbps.

The voltage gain is extended easily and the voltage stress on the switches is reduced with different turns ratios of the coupled inductors. The output diode reverse-recovery problem is alleviated due to the inherent leakage inductor of the winding-coupled inductors. The simple but effective passive lossless clamp circuits are introduced to limit the voltage stress on the switches when they turn off so that the low-voltage, high-performance devices with low conduction resistor can be used in the proposed converter to reduce the relative losses. The leakage energy is ultimately recovered to the load. The high efficiency of 90.7% at full load and the maximum efficiency of 92.6% are achieved in a 1-kW 40-V-input-to-380-V-output prototype for front-end application. There is more than 10% efficiency improvement with the passive lossless clamp circuits compared to the case with RCD dissipated snubbers.

Therefore, our model can be used to segment images with intensity inhomogeneity, which overcomes the limitation of piecewise constant models.

Nevertheless, the dc/dc converter can continue operating when the voltage across the energy storage device droops along with its discharge. Theoretical calculation and experimental measurement reveal that power loss and peak current impose limitations on a permissible dc-voltage range. This information may be useful in design of the dc/dc converter. A laboratory model of the energy storage system rated at 200 V and 2.6 kJ designed and constructed in this paper verifies that the dc/dc converter can charge and discharge the capacitor bank properly.

The performance of a typical HF RFID reader loop antenna in the proximity of various metal plate configurations is experimentally investigated in terms of resonant frequency, field intensity, and field distribution. The study shows that the presence of the metal plates shifts up the resonant frequency of the antenna and weakens its field intensity. The proximity effects are strongly dependent on the size of the metal plate, distance between the plate and the antenna as well as the orientation of the plate. Such effects greatly degrade the reading range and restrict the co-existence of HF RFID systems. A solution to alleviate the effects is to re-tune or co-design the reader antenna in proximity with the metallic objects based on the information from the study. As an example, a loop antenna is co-designed with a metal plate to configure a metal-backed loop antenna, and optimized for an RFID smart shelf system to restrain the interference and enhance the detection accuracy.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2007.908575","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4380580","High frequency (HF);loop antenna;metallic environment;proximity effect;radio frequency identification (RFID);smart shelf","Proximity effect;Radiofrequency identification;Radio frequency;Inorganic materials;Hafnium;Resonant frequency;Degradation;RFID tags;Antennas and propagation;Interference","HF antennas;loop antennas;radiofrequency identification","metallic environments;high frequency RFID reader loop antenna;proximity effects;radio frequency identification;metal plate configuration;frequency 13.56 MHz;field distribution;field intensity;resonant frequency;frequency 13.56 MHz","","81","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"The Regularized Iteratively Reweighted MAD Method for Change Detection in Multi- and Hyperspectral Data","A. A. Nielsen","Informatics & Math. Modelling, Tech. Univ. Denmark, Lyngby","IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","","2007","16","2","463","478","This paper describes new extensions to the previously published multivariate alteration detection (MAD) method for change detection in bi-temporal, multi- and hypervariate data such as remote sensing imagery. Much like boosting methods often applied in data mining work, the iteratively reweighted (IR) MAD method in a series of iterations places increasing focus on ""difficult"" observations, here observations whose change status over time is uncertain. The MAD method is based on the established technique of canonical correlation analysis: for the multivariate data acquired at two points in time and covering the same geographical region, we calculate the canonical variates and subtract them from each other. These orthogonal differences contain maximum information on joint change in all variables (spectral bands). The change detected in this fashion is invariant to separate linear (affine) transformations in the originally measured variables at the two points in time, such as 1) changes in gain and offset in the measuring device used to acquire the data, 2) data normalization or calibration schemes that are linear (affine) in the gray values of the original variables, or 3) orthogonal or other affine transformations, such as principal component (PC) or maximum autocorrelation factor (MAF) transformations. The IR-MAD method first calculates ordinary canonical and original MAD variates. In the following iterations we apply different weights to the observations, large weights being assigned to observations that show little change, i.e., for which the sum of squared, standardized MAD variates is small, and small weights being assigned to observations for which the sum is large. Like the original MAD method, the iterative extension is invariant to linear (affine) transformations of the original variables. To stabilize solutions to the (IR-)MAD problem, some form of regularization may be needed. This is especially useful for work on hyperspectral data. This paper describes ordinary two-set canonical correlation analysis, the MAD transformation, the iterative extension, and three regularization schemes. A simple case with real Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data at one point in time and (partly) constructed data at the other point in time that demonstrates the superiority of the iterative scheme over the original MAD method is shown. Also, examples with SPOT High Resolution Visible data from an agricultural region in Kenya, and hyperspectral airborne HyMap data from a small rural area in southeastern Germany are given. The latter case demonstrates the need for regularization","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2006.888195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4060945","Canonical correlation analysis (CCA);iteratively reweighted multivariate alteration detection (IR-MAD);MAD transformation;regularization or penalization;remote sensing","Hyperspectral imaging;Remote sensing;Gain measurement;Time measurement;Iterative methods;Hyperspectral sensors;Boosting;Data mining;Calibration;Autocorrelation","affine transforms;geophysical signal processing;iterative methods;object detection;principal component analysis;remote sensing","regularized iteratively reweighted method;MAD method;change detection;hyperspectral data;multispectral data;multivariate alteration detection method;remote sensing imagery;canonical correlation analysis;separate linear transformations;affine transformations;calibration schemes;data normalization;maximum autocorrelation factor;principal component;Landsat Thematic Mapper;agricultural region;Kenya;hyperspectral airborne HyMap data;southeastern Germany","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Statistical;Multivariate Analysis;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique;User-Computer Interface","268","","54","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Considering, however, that optimum performance implies minimum loss, no overloading of transformers and cables, correct voltage profile, and absence of phase voltage and current imbalances, network reconfiguration alone is insufficient. It has to be complemented with techniques for phase rearrangement between the distribution transformer banks and the specific primary feeder with a radial structure and dynamic phase and load balancing along a feeder with a radial structure. This paper contributes such a technique at the low-voltage and medium-voltage levels of a distribution network simultaneously with reconfiguration at both levels. While the neural network is adopted for the network reconfiguration problem, this paper introduces a heuristic method for the phase balancing/loss minimization problem. A comparison of the heuristic algorithm with that of the neural network shows the former to be more robust. The approach proposed here, therefore for the combined problem, uses the neural network in conjunction with a heuristic method which enables different reconfiguration switches to be turned on/off and connected consumers to be switched between different phases to keep the phases balanced. An application example of the proposed method using real data is presented.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2007.905581","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4302558","Distribution automation;distribution control;heuristic algorithm;load balancing;neural network;optimal control;phase arrangement;phase current imbalance;phase voltage imbalance;power loss;reconfiguration","Load management;Neural networks;Transformers;Performance loss;Cables;Medium voltage;Minimization methods;Heuristic algorithms;Robustness;Switches","distribution networks;neural nets;power distribution control;power system analysis computing","load balancing;LV distribution networks;MV distribution networks;network reconfiguration;distribution transformer banks;specific primary feeder;phase rearrangement;neural network;phase balancing;loss minimization;heuristic method;optimum performance;automated distribution system reconfiguration","","85","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The absorption in the stop band helps reduce additional WLAN multipath fading caused by conventional reflecting FSS designs. The first layer of the FSS consists of conventional conducting cross dipoles having a circular aperture in the centre, while the second layer uses resistive cross dipoles. Moreover, the conducting cross dipoles have been sandwiched between two dielectric sheets to achieve a stable response for different angles of incidence. The periodicity of both FSS layers is the same while the distance between the two layers is reduced to one eighth of the free-space wavelength.

Applying the proposed method to navigation of image browsing, experimental results show that our method achieves satisfactory performance.","1945-788X","1-4244-1016-9","10.1109/ICME.2007.4284820","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4284820","","Image segmentation;Keyboards;Motion detection;Computer vision;Pervasive computing;Cameras;Pattern recognition;Mice;Robustness;Tracking","computer vision;feature extraction;gesture recognition;image segmentation","hand gesture recognition;vision gesture interface;hand interaction;hand detection;image segmentation;motion cues;color cues;aspect ratio;feature detection;image browsing","","74","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Advanced Wearable Health Systems and Applications - Research and Development Efforts in the European Union","A. Lmberis; A. Dittmar","NA; NA","IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","","2007","26","3","29","33","Research and development on smart wearable health systems and applications (SWHSA) was motivated by the need to respond successfully to the healthcare challenges of reducing healthcare costs while maintaining a high quality of care, providing ubiquitous easy access to care, and shifting the focus of healthcare expenditure from treatment to prevention through wellness programs. Physiological monitoring with SWHS has so far dealt mostly with measurement of vital signs like ECG, heart rate, respiratory rate, skin temperature, and posture. There is a trend to extend monitoring capabilities toward biochemical variables. There are several promising techniques for achieving this type of monitoring in a purely noninvasive, painless way. One could thus envisage the integration of noninvasive transdermal biosensors in SWHS;e.g., in biomedical clothes. The future development of intelligent biomedical clothing (IBC) based on full integration of sensors/actuators, energy sources, processing, and communication within the clothes could overcome barriers to existing wearable health systems. The area of SWHSA is further developed in FP6 (Framework Program 5) of the EC, through significant support of new functionalized systems based on the integration of several technologies and disciplines such as micro/nanotechnologies, textile materials, physiology, biology/biochemistry, and ICT (information and communication technologies) as well as data integration and decision support. This area is expected also to be further developed within FP7.","1937-4186","","10.1109/MEMB.2007.364926","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4213098","","Research and development;Biomedical monitoring;Medical services;Biosensors;Intelligent sensors;Intelligent actuators;Costs;Heart rate measurement;Biomedical measurements;Electrocardiography","actuators;biochemistry;decision support systems;health care;intelligent sensors;medical computing;molecular biophysics;nanobiotechnology;skin;telemedicine;textiles","advanced wearable health systems;smart wearable health systems;healthcare costs;high care quality;wellness programs;physiological monitoring;ECG;heart rate;respiratory rate;skin temperature;posture;biochemical variables;noninvasive transdermal biosensors;intelligent biomedical clothing;actuators;energy sources;microtechnology;nanotechnology;textile materials;physiology;biochemistry;ICT;information technology;communication technology;data integration;decision support","","98","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
"Fuzzy logic based traffic light controller","G. H. Kulkarni; P. G. Waingankar","Unique Academy, Nashik, India; Department of El&Tc, Thadomal Sahani College of Engg, Mumbai, India","2007 International Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","","2007","","","107","110","Traffic congestion is a major concern for many cities throughout the world. Developing a sophisticated traffic monitoring and control system would result in an effective solution to this problem. In a conventional traffic light controller, the traffic lights change at constant cycle time. Hence it does not provide an optimal solution. Many traffic light controllers implemented in current practice, are based on the 'time-of-the-day' scheme, which use a limited number of predetermined traffic light patterns and implement these patterns depending upon the time of the day. These automated systems do not provide an optimal control for fluctuating traffic volumes. A traffic light controller based on fuzzy logic can be used for optimum control of fluctuating traffic volumes such as over saturated or unusual load conditions. The objective is to improve the vehicular throughput and minimize delays. The rules of fuzzy logic controller are formulated by following the same protocols that a human operator would use to control the time intervals of the traffic light. The length of the current green phase is extended or terminated depending upon the 'arrival' i.e. the number of vehicles approaching the green phase and the 'queue' that corresponds to the number of queuing vehicles in red phases. A prototype system for controlling traffic at an intersection is designed using VB6 and Matlab tool. The traffic intersection is simulated in VB6 and the data regarding the traffic parameters is collected in VB6 environment. The decision on the duration of the extension is taken using the Matlab tool. This decision is based on the Arrival and Queue of vehicles, which is imported in Matlab from VB6 environment. The time delay experienced by the vehicles using the fixed as well as fuzzy traffic controller is then compared to observe the effectiveness of the fuzzy traffic controller.","2164-7011","978-1-4244-1151-1","10.1109/ICIINFS.2007.4579157","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579157","Fuzzy Logic;Fuzzy Variables;Membership Functions;Fuzzy Rule Base","Fuzzy logic;Lighting control;Traffic control;Vehicles;Automatic control;Control systems;Fuzzy control;Cities and towns;Monitoring;Optimal control","fuzzy control;mathematics computing;optimal control;road traffic;road vehicles;traffic control;traffic engineering computing;Visual BASIC","fuzzy logic based traffic light controller;traffic congestion;sophisticated traffic monitoring;time-of-the-day scheme;optimum control;unusual load condition;vehicular throughput;protocol;Matlab tool;Visual Basic 6 environment;time delay;prototype system","","26","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, a conventional (one stage) estimation scheme is presented. The single state estimation scheme is shown to have degraded performance in bias state estimation and dead-reckoning due to vehicle model errors. However, the states for position and velocity are not highly coupled to the tractor dynamic states, allowing for separation of the estimators. Therefore, the state estimation algorithms are divided into two cascaded estimators in order to prevent the errors in the vehicle model from corrupting the navigation states. A dead reckoning (or navigation) estimator estimates all of the inertial sensor biases while GPS is available. When GPS is not available, the dead reckoning estimator integrates rate measurements to provide position and heading estimates in order to maintain continuous control of the vehicle through these GPS outages. A second estimator is then used to estimate the additional states needed for full state feedback control algorithms. Bias estimates from the dead reckoning estimator are used to correct the sensor measurement used in the second estimator. An extended kalman filter (EKF) is utilized for each of the estimators. Results are given, showing that the cascaded estimation technique provides better estimation of the vehicle states over a conventional estimation scheme, especially during a GPS outage. Results are also given which verify the ability of the estimation algorithm to estimate all of the system biases and provide continuous control of the tractor through a short GPS outage","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2006.883311","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4105932","Cascaded estimation;dead-reckoning navigation;decentralized Kalman filters;ground vehicle navigation","State estimation;Navigation;State feedback;Land vehicles;Global Positioning System;Dead reckoning;Agricultural machinery;Degradation;Vehicle dynamics;Position measurement","agricultural machinery;agriculture;Global Positioning System;inertial navigation;Kalman filters;nonlinear filters;state estimation;state feedback","cascaded Kalman filters;dead-reckoning navigation;state feedback control;ground vehicles;farm tractor;Global Positioning System;multiple biases state estimation;inertial sensor;sensor measurement;extended Kalman filter","","72","","49","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compression of pixel-type data including stereo video, multiview video, and associated depth or disparity maps extends available principles of classical video coding. Powerful algorithms and open international standards for multiview video coding and coding of video plus depth data are available and under development, which will provide the basis for introduction of various 3DTV systems and services in the near future. Compression of 3D mesh models has also reached a high level of maturity. For static geometry, a variety of powerful algorithms are available to efficiently compress vertices and connectivity. Compression of dynamic 3D geometry is currently a more active field of research. Temporal prediction is an important mechanism to remove redundancy from animated 3D mesh sequences. Error resilience is important for transmission of data over error prone channels, and multiple description coding (MDC) is a suitable way to protect data. MDC of still images and 2D video has already been widely studied, whereas multiview video and 3D meshes have been addressed only recently. Intellectual property protection of 3D data by watermarking is a pioneering research area as well. The 3D watermarking methods in the literature are classified into three groups, considering the dimensions of the main components of scene representations and the resulting components after applying the algorithm. In general, 3DTV coding technology is maturating. Systems and services may enter the market in the near future. However, the research area is relatively young compared to coding of other types of media. Therefore, there is still a lot of room for improvement and new development of algorithms.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2007.909972","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4373329","Depth coding;disparity coding;MPEG;multiview video coding (MVC);multiple description coding (MDC);stereo video coding;watermarking;3-D mesh compression;3DTV","Video compression;Layout;Video coding;Geometry;Protection;Watermarking;Displays;Standards development;Power system modeling;Redundancy","stereo image processing;video coding;watermarking","coding algorithms;3DTV technology;media processing chain;3D scene representations;pixel-type data compression;stereo video coding;disparity maps;open international standards;multiview video coding;depth data;3D mesh models;static geometry;dynamic 3D geometry;temporal prediction;animated 3D mesh sequences;error resilience;data transmission;error prone channels;multiple description coding;2D video;intellectual property protection;3D watermarking;depth coding;disparity coding","","211","","154","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to achieve maximum torque per ampere (MTPA), knowledge of the motor parameters is necessary. Due to the high ambient temperature inside the engine cavity as well as the saturation effect, variation of motor parameters such as inductances and permanent magnet (PM) flux density is not avoidable. Offline models for estimating the motor parameters are known as a computationally intensive method, particularly, when the effect of cross saturation and PM flux deterioration are included. In this paper, a practical MTPA control scheme, along with a simple parameter estimator for the PMa SynRM, is introduced. This method is capable of maintaining the MTPA condition and stays robust against motor parameter variations. To verify the validity and feasibility of the proposed controller, several simulations and experiments results on a low-power laboratory prototype PMa SynRM have been presented.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2007.896974","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4273746","Maximum torque per ampere (MTPA);online parameter estimation;parameter variation;permanent-magnet-assisted (PMa) SynRM","Robust control;Torque control;Reluctance motors;Traction motors;Synchronous motors;Permanent magnet motors;Parameter estimation;Hybrid electric vehicles;Temperature;Engines","hybrid electric vehicles;permanent magnet motors;reluctance motors;traction motors","maximum torque per ampere control;PM-assisted SynRM;permanent-magnet-assisted synchronous reluctance motors;traction motor;hybrid electric vehicle;motor parameters;high ambient temperature;engine cavity;flux deterioration;parameter estimator","","75","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Much of the work in the literature considers maximum likelihood (ML) estimation. However, the ML estimator given by the location of the peak of a periodogram in the frequency domain shown in D.C. Rife and R. R. Boorstyn, ""Single-tone parameter estimation from discrete-time observations,"" IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. IT-20, pp. 591-598, Sep. 1974, has a very high computational complexity. This paper derives the explicit structure of the ML estimator for data processing in the time domain, assuming only reasonably high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The result of this approximate ML estimator shows that both the phase and the magnitude of the noisy signal samples are utilized in the estimator, and the phase data alone as assumed in S. A. Tretter, ""Estimating the frequency of a noisy sinusoid by linear regression"", IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. IT-31, pp. 832-835, Nov. 1985 and S.

The sample-by-sample iterative processing nature of the estimator enables us to propose a novel, recursive phase-unwrapping algorithm that allows the estimator to be implemented efficiently. To facilitate the performance analysis, a new, linearized observation model for the instantaneous signal phase that is more accurate than that of S. A.

This new model explains physically why the phase data are weighted by the magnitude information in the ML estimator. Moreover, by incorporating a priori knowledge via the a priori probability density function of the unknown frequency and the carrier phase, the explicit structure of the approximate maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimator is derived, and the Bayesian Cramer-Rao lower bound (BCRLB) on the mean-square error (mse) is obtained.

Loh","Univ. of Alberta, Edmonton; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","","2007","43","5","1172","1182","Capacitors are widely used for power-factor correction (PFC) in power systems. When a PFC capacitor is installed with a certain load in a microgrid, it may be in parallel with the filter capacitor of the inverter interfacing the utility grid and the local distributed-generation unit and, thus, change the effective filter capacitance. Another complication is the possibility of occurrence of resonance in the microgrid. This paper conducts an in-depth investigation of the effective shunt-filter-capacitance variation and resonance phenomena in a microgrid due to a connection of a PFC capacitor. To compensate the capacitance-parameter variation, an Hinfin controller is designed for the voltage-source- inverter voltage control. By properly choosing the weighting functions, the synthesized Hinfin controller would exhibit high gains at the vicinity of the line frequency, similar to traditional high- performance P+ resonant controller and, thus, would possess nearly zero steady-state error. However, with the robust Hinfin controller, it will be possible to explicitly specify the degree of robustness in face of parameter variations. Furthermore, a thorough investigation is carried out to study the performance of inner current-loop feedback variables under resonance conditions. It reveals that filter-inductor current feedback is more effective in damping the resonance. This resonance can be further attenuated by employing the dual-inverter microgrid conditioner and controlling the series inverter as a virtual resistor affecting only harmonic components without interference with the fundamental power flow. And finally, the study in this paper has been tested experimentally using an experimental microgrid prototype.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2007.904388","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4305324","Distributed generation (DG);H$\infty$  control;microgrids;power-factor-correction (PFC) capacitor;resonance attenuation","Robust control;Capacitors;Resonance;Inverters;Capacitance;Voltage control;Feedback;Power harmonic filters;Power systems;Performance gain","Hinfin control;power capacitors;power distribution control;power factor correction;power grids;resonant invertors;robust control;voltage control","damping;filter-inductor current feedback;Hinfin controller;voltage-source-inverter voltage control;distributed-generation unit;filter capacitor;power-factor correction;PFC capacitor;microgrid;robust control scheme","","52","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, model derivation is still a challenging task, despite the extensive research that has been devoted to this topic. In fact, it is a common experience that modeling or simulation tasks sometimes fail, often without a clear understanding of the main reason. This paper presents the fundamental properties of causality, stability, and passivity that electrical interconnect models must satisfy in order to be physically consistent. All basic definitions are reviewed in time domain, Laplace domain, and frequency domain, and all significant interrelations between these properties are outlined. This background material is used to interpret several common situations where either model derivation or model use in a computer-aided design environment fails dramatically.

The industry recognizes the problem and is just now starting to act. Although prevention is the best way to reduce frauds, fraudsters are adaptive and will usually find ways to circumvent such measures. Detecting fraud is essential once prevention mechanism has failed. Several data mining algorithms have been developed that allow one to extract relevant knowledge from a large amount of data like fraudulent financial statements to detect FSF. Detecting FSF is a new attempt; thus, several research questions have often being asked: (1) Can FSF be detected? How likely and how to do it? (2) What data features can be used to predict FSF?

"Design and Analysis of a 3-Arm Spiral Antenna","D. J. Muller; K. Sarabandi","Inst. fur Hochstfrequenztechnik und Elektron., Karlsruhe Univ.; NA","IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","","2007","55","2","258","266","A novel 3-arm spiral antenna structure is presented in this paper. This antenna similar to traditional two-arm or four-arm spiral antennas exhibits wideband radiation characteristic and circular polarization. Advantages offered by the new design are two fold. Unlike the traditional spiral antennas the three-arm spiral can be fed by an unbalanced transmission line, such as a coaxial line or coplanar waveguide, and therefore an external balun is not needed at the feed point. Also by proper choice of arms' dimensions the antenna can be directly matched to any practical transmission line characteristic impedance and therefore external matching networks are not required. This is accomplished by feeding the antenna at the outer radius by a coplanar waveguide (CPW) transmission line and tapering it towards the center. The antenna can also be fed from the center using a coaxial or CPW line perpendicular to the plane of the spiral antenna. A full-wave numerical simulation tool is used to optimize the geometry of the proposed 3-arm spiral to achieve a compact size, wide bandwidth operation, and low axial ratio. The antenna is also designed over a ground plane to achieve a unidirectional radiation and center loading is examined that improves the axial ratio. Simulated results like return loss, radiation pattern, gain, and axial ratio are compared with those obtained from measurements and good agreements are shown. Because of its unique feed structure and compact size, application of the proposed 3-arm spiral antenna for wideband array applications is demonstrated","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2006.889798","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4084796","Circular polarization;unbalanced spiral;wideband antenna","Spirals;Broadband antennas;Coplanar waveguides;Transmission line antennas;Antenna feeds;Coplanar transmission lines;Coaxial components;Polarization;Impedance matching;Arm","antenna feeds;antenna radiation patterns;coaxial cables;coplanar transmission lines;coplanar waveguide components;electromagnetic wave polarisation;spiral antennas;waveguide antenna arrays","3-arm spiral antenna structure;circular polarization;antenna feed;coplanar waveguide transmission line;CPW;coaxial line;full-wave numerical simulation tool;unidirectional radiation;radiation pattern;wideband array application","","26","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We highlight the importance of a new class of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for network-centric military urban operations. We review some of the UAVs that have been developed in recent years, and that are under development, with particular attention to their endurance, portability, performance, payload, and communication capabilities. Selected university testbeds are also briefly noted. Over the last few years there has been considerable research focused on how these small UAVs, both individually and collectively, can operate autonomously in urban environments and help capture and communicate needed information. We discuss some of this research; specific topics covered include guidance and control for autonomous operation, multi-UAV coordination and route optimization, and ad-hoc networking with UAV nodes.

First, we develop a general framework for analyzing performance of beamforming algorithms based on the acoustic MIMO channel impulse responses. Second, we study the bounds for the length of the beamforming filter, which in turn shows the performance bounds of beamforming in terms of speech dereverberation and interference suppression.

Remarkably, ISO 9126 does not provide a consensual set of measures for estimating maintainability on the basis of a system's source code. On the other hand, the maintainability index has been proposed to calculate a single number that expresses the maintainability of a system. In this paper, we discuss several problems with the MI, and we identify a number of requirements to be fulfilled by a maintainability model to be usable in practice.

"Accumulate-Repeat-Accumulate Codes","A. Abbasfar; D. Divsalar; K. Yao","Rambus Inc, Los Altos, CA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Communications","","2007","55","4","692","702","In this paper, we propose an innovative channel coding scheme called accumulate-repeat-accumulate (ARA) codes. This class of codes can be viewed as serial turbo-like codes or as a subclass of low-density parity check (LDPC) codes, and they have a projected graph or protograph representation; this allows for high-speed iterative decoding implementation using belief propagation. An ARA code can be viewed as precoded repeat accumulate (RA) code with puncturing or as precoded irregular repeat accumulate (IRA) code, where simply an accumulator is chosen as the precoder. The amount of performance improvement due to the precoder will be called precoding gain. Using density evolution on their associated protographs, we find some rate-1/2 ARA codes, with a maximum variable node degree of 5 for which a minimum bit SNR as low as 0.08 dB from channel capacity threshold is achieved as the block size goes to infinity. Such a low threshold cannot be achieved by RA, IRA, or unstructured irregular LDPC codes with the same constraint on the maximum variable node degree. Furthermore, by puncturing the inner accumulator, we can construct families of higher rate ARA codes with thresholds that stay close to their respective channel capacity thresholds uniformly. Iterative decoding simulation results are provided and compared with turbo codes. In addition to iterative decoding analysis, we analyzed the performance of ARA codes with maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding. By obtaining the weight distribution of these codes and through existing tightest bounds we have shown that the ML SNR threshold of ARA codes also approaches very closely to that of random codes.

Green computing refers to supporting business critical computing needs with least possible amount of power or sustainable computing. This represents a dramatic change in priority in IT industry. In the past, the sole focus was on IT equipment processing power and associated equipment spending while infrastructure that includes power, cooling and data center space was always assumed available, ready, a given and affordable. Today, the infrastructure is becoming a limiting factor that can determine how and if IT equipment can be deployed to meet business growth while processing power is becoming a given, even thought not ignored. The driving force behind this change comes from the ever growing business computing needs, fast growing burden of energy cost, growing awareness of global warming issues, and increasing sense of national energy security. On the fronts of global warming issues and energy security, various regulations and laws will soon be in place that will force the use of IT equipment that meet certain energy efficiency requirements. Equally important is the concern for ever growing cost burden for supporting growing business critical computing needs that outpace the infrastructure growth. This paper will provide a review of how IT equipment power consumption across the industry is changing the IT industry priority. It will focus on how equipment power consumption impacts the overall power usage and total cost of ownership and how the power issues may impact what customers may or may not buy and deploy to meet their business needs. It will also briefly cover the general technological trends in the IT industry of what technologies are available in the race to meet green computing requirements.","","1-4244-1252-8","10.1109/HDP.2007.4283590","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4283590","","Costs;Energy consumption;Global warming;National security;Packaging;Radio access networks;Apertures;Space cooling;Energy efficiency;Computer industry","computer facilities;power aware computing;power consumption","green computing;business critical computing;power computing;sustainable computing;IT equipment power consumption;IT industry;business needs","","25","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Stationarity is important as it is a necessary condition of a local minimum. This paper discusses the difficulty of proving the convergence.

Inspired by recent advancements in image inpainting techniques, we propose an image compression framework towards visual quality rather than pixel-wise fidelity. In this framework, an original image is analyzed at the encoder side so that portions of the image are intentionally and automatically skipped. Instead, some information is extracted from these skipped regions and delivered to the decoder as assistant information in the compressed fashion. The delivered assistant information plays a key role in the proposed framework because it guides image inpainting to accurately restore these regions at the decoder side. Moreover, to fully take advantage of the assistant information, a compression-oriented edge-based inpainting algorithm is proposed for image restoration, integrating pixel-wise structure propagation and patch-wise texture synthesis. We also construct a practical system to verify the effectiveness of the compression approach in which edge map serves as assistant information and the edge extraction and region removal approaches are developed accordingly. Evaluations have been made in comparison with baseline JPEG and standard MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 intra-picture coding. Experimental results show that our system achieves up to 44% and 33% bits-savings, respectively, at similar visual quality levels. Our proposed framework is a promising exploration towards future image and video compression.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2007.903663","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4335633","Edge extraction;image compression;image inpainting;structure propagation;texture synthesis;visual redundancy","Image coding;Pixel;Data mining;Decoding;Image restoration;Image analysis;Transform coding;MPEG 4 Standard;Automatic voltage control;Video compression","data compression;feature extraction;image coding;image resolution;image restoration;image texture","region removal;edge extraction;image restoration;patch-wise texture synthesis;pixel-wise structure propagation;compression-oriented edge-based inpainting;skipped regions;pixel-wise fidelity;visual quality;visual redundancy;image compression","","86","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An emerging trend is to used modified commercial game engines for physical simulation and visualization. The game engines that are commercially available today are capable of physical simulations providing basic physical properties and interactions between objects. Newer and/or specialized engines such as the flight simulator X-Plane or Ageia PhysX and Havok physics engines, are capable of simulating more complex physical interactions between objects. Researchers in need of a simulator have a choice of using game engines or available open source and commercially available simulators, allowing resources to be focused on research instead of building a new simulator.

This paper aims to track a user position in both indoor and outdoor environments by using a single wireless device with minimal tracking error. RSSI (received signal strength indication) technique together with enhancement algorithms is proposed to cater this solution. The proposed RSSI-based tracking technique is divided into two main phases, namely the calibration of RSSI coefficients (deterministic phase) and the distance along with position estimation of user location by iterative trilateration (probabilistic phase). A low complexity RSSI smoothing algorithm is implemented to minimize the dynamic fluctuation of radio signal received from each reference node when the target node is moving. Experiment measurements are carried out to analyze the sensitivity of RSSI.

In these applications, autonomous navigation methods allow a mobile robot to explore an environment independent of human presence or intervention. The mobile robot contains the measurement device and records the data then either transmits it or brings it back to the operator. Sensors are required for the robot to detect obstacles in the navigation environment, and machine intelligence is required for the robot to plan a path around these obstacles. The use of genetic algorithms is an example of machine intelligence applications to modern robot navigation.

By employing these enabling technologies, we design and experimentally demonstrate an optical-wireless testbed that is simultaneously delivering wired and wireless services in the integrated optical-wireless and wavelength-division-multiplexing passive-optical-network access networks.

DC-DC converters maintain legal voltage ranges regardless of the load current variation as well as battery voltage drop. Although the efficiency of dc-dc converters is changed by the output voltage level and the load current, most existing power management techniques simply ignore the efficiency variation of dc-dc converters. However, without a careful consideration of the efficiency variation of dc-dc converters, finding a true optimal power management will be impossible. In this paper, we solve the problem of energy minimization with the consideration of the characteristics of power consumption of dc-dc converters. Specifically, the contributions of our work are as follows: 1) We analyze the effects of the efficiency variation of dc-dc converters on a single-task execution in dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) scheme and propose the technique for dc-dc converter-aware energy-minimal DVS. 2) is then extended to embed an awareness of the characteristics of dc-dc converters in general DVS techniques for multiple tasks. 3) We go on to propose a technique called for generating a dc-dc converter that is most energy efficient for a particular application. 4) We also present an integrated framework, i.e., , based on and , which addresses dc-dc converter configuration and DVS simultaneously.

We investigate both InAs/InP dashes in a barrier and dashes in a well (DWELL) heterostructures operating at 1.5 mum. These two types of QDs can provide high gain and low losses. Continuous-wave (CW) room-temperature lasing operation on ground state of cavity length as short as 200 mum has been achieved, demonstrating the high modal gain of the active core. A threshold current density as low as 110 A/cm2 per QD layer has been obtained for infinite-length DWELL laser. An optimized DWELL structure allows achieving of a T0 larger than 100 K for broad-area (BA) lasers, and of 80 K for single-transverse-mode lasers in the temperature range between 25degC and 85degC. Buried ridge stripe (BRS)-type single-mode distributed feedback (DFB) lasers are also demonstrated for the first time, exhibiting a side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) as high as 45 dB. Such DFB lasers allow the first floor-free 10-Gb/s direct modulation for back-to-back and transmission over 16-km standard optical fiber. In addition, novel results are given on gain, noise, and four-wave mixing of QD-based semiconductor optical amplifiers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that QD Fabry-Perot (FP) lasers, owing to the small confinement factor and the three-dimensional (3-D) quantification of electronic energy levels, exhibit a beating linewidth as narrow as 15 kHz. Such an extremely narrow linewidth, compared to their QW or bulk counterparts, leads to the excellent phase noise and time-jitter characteristics when QD lasers are actively mode-locked.

This paper investigates the behavior of capacity when constraints are placed on the channel output signal (as well as generalizations thereof). While such a change in perspective leaves the point-to-point problem (essentially) unchanged, the main conclusion is that in certain network scenarios, including multiple-access and relay situations, both the structure of the problem and the conclusions change. For example, capacity results are found for the many-user Gaussian multiple-access channel (MAC) with arbitrarily dependent sources, cooperation, or feedback, and for the nondegraded Gaussian relay network. The investigations are motivated by recent questions arising in spectrum sharing and dynamic spectrum allocation: Multiple independent networks share the same frequency band, but are spatially mostly disjoint. One approach to grant coexistence is via spatial interference power restrictions, imposed at the network level, rather than at the device level.

In this way, the determination of the radial distortion is an easy add-on to the popular calibration method proposed. The method is entirely noniterative and, hence, is extremely rapid and immune to the problem of local minima. Our method determines the radial distortion in a parameter-free way, not relying on any particular radial distortion model. This makes it applicable to a large range of cameras from narrow-angle to fish-eye lenses. The method also computes the center of radial distortion, which, we argue, is important in obtaining optimal results.

Our method selects depth estimates for each pixel that minimize violations of visibility constraints and thus remove errors and inconsistencies from the depth maps to produce a consistent surface. We advocate a two-stage process in which the first stage generates potentially noisy, overlapping depth maps from a set of calibrated images and the second stage fuses these depth maps to obtain an integrated surface with higher accuracy, suppressed noise, and reduced redundancy. We show that by dividing the processing into two stages we are able to achieve a very high throughput because we are able to use a computationally cheap stereo algorithm and because this architecture is amenable to hardware-accelerated (GPU) implementations. A rigorous formulation based on the notion of stability of a depth estimate is presented first. It aims to determine the validity of a depth estimate by rendering multiple depth maps into the reference view as well as rendering the reference depth map into the other views in order to detect occlusions and free- space violations. We also present an approximate alternative formulation that selects and validates only one hypothesis based on confidence. Both formulations enable us to perform video-based reconstruction at up to 25 frames per second.

The effects of the concentration of polymer solution, spinning voltage and collection distance between the tip to target on the morphological appearance and average diameter of the as-spun PVA fibers were investigated. A more comprehensive and systematic understanding of process parameters of the electrospinning was obtained. In this experiment fibers with diameter ranging from 100 nm to 1000 nm were obtained. The results showed that the solution concentration significantly affected the morphology and diameters of the as-spun PVA fibers. Lower concentration tended to facilitate the formation of fibers with beads. With increasing solution concentration, the morphology was changed from beaded fiber to smooth and uniform fiber and the fiber diameter was increased. Spinning voltage also had an important influence on the diameters of fibers, while the collection distance slightly affected the diameters of fibers. Thinner fibers were received on the target with lower voltage applied on the nozzle. The morphology of fibers electrospun from PVA was observed and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).","2159-1687","1-4244-0750-8","10.1109/ICSD.2007.4290790","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4290790","electrospinning;nanofibers;poly(vinyl alcohol)","Voltage;Polymers;Morphology;Spinning;Scanning electron microscopy;Electrostatics;Optical fiber testing;Water;Solids;Dielectrics","","","","10","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The design of high performance control algorithms for DVR control with improved robustness and desirable steady-state and transient characteristics is therefore an important area of study. In this paper, two voltage controllers are proposed in the stationary frame for DVR voltage regulation. A P+resonant controller is first designed to achieve good positive- and negative-sequence fundamental voltage control with the virtue of having high gains around plusmn50Hz. Stationary-to-synchronous frame transformations carried out in traditional synchronous proportional-integral regulators are no longer required with this method. However, with the purpose of achieving explicit robustness in face of parameter variations, an Hinfin controller is also designed. Detailed design procedure is presented to show how an Hinfin controller with high gains around plusmn50Hz can be synthesized through careful selection of its weighting functions. A thorough discussion and performance comparison of these two controllers in both transient and steady-state conditions are also carried out. Finally, both controllers are extensively tested on a laboratory 10-kV medium voltage level DVR system with various voltage sags and loading conditions","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2006.890002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4118313","Dynamic voltage restorer (DVR);${H}\infty$ control;nonlinear load;resonant controller;stationary-frame controller;unbalanced voltage sag","Voltage control;Robust control;Steady-state;Algorithm design and analysis;Regulators;Control system synthesis;Control systems;System testing;Laboratories;Medium voltage","control system synthesis;Hinfin control;PI control;power supply quality;power system restoration;robust control;transient analysis;voltage control","high performance stationary-frame controllers;dynamic voltage restorer;performance control algorithm design;transient characteristics;robust control;steady-state characteristics;voltage controllers;voltage regulation;P+ resonant controller design;voltage control;proportional-integral regulators;Hinfin controller;voltage sags;10 kV","","91","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To implement a sensitivity-based screening technique for guidance in optimally locating a single UPFC in a power system, we propose a new UPFC model, which consists of an ideal transformer with a complex turns ratio and a variable shunt admittance. In this model, the UPFC control variables do not depend explicitly on UPFC input and output currents and voltages.

We focus on the problem of minimizing the downlink sum-MSE under a sum power constraint. It is shown that this problem can be solved efficiently by exploiting a duality between the downlink and uplink MSE feasible regions. We propose two different optimization frameworks for downlink MMSE transceiver design. The first one solves an equivalent uplink problem, then the result is transferred to the original downlink problem. Duality ensures that any uplink MMSE scheme, e.g., linear MMSE reception or MMSE-decision feedback equalization (DFE), has a downlink counterpart. We propose two globally optimum algorithms based on convex optimization. The basic idea of the second framework is to perform optimization in an alternating manner by switching between the virtual uplink and downlink channels. This strategy exploits that the same MSE can be achieved in both links for a given choice of transmit and receive filters. This iteration is proven to be convergent.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2007.899283","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4355332","Duality;minimum mean square error (MMSE);multiuser multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO);transceiver design","Downlink;Transceivers;MIMO;Mean square error methods;Mobile communication;Interference;Laboratories;Wiener filter;Design optimization;Feedback","decision feedback equalisers;least mean squares methods;MIMO communication;radio links","downlink MMSE transceiver optimization;multiuser MIMO systems;sum-MSE minimization;minimum mean square error;point-to-multipoint transmission;equivalent uplink problem;MMSE-decision feedback equalization;receive filters","","140","","46","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The basic fail-safe function has already been verified through simulations and experiments to provide stable driving without any sudden stops even when the elements constituting the driving systems fail. Then, methods to control phenomena occurring at the time of braking, which are uncontrollable only by driver's pedal operations, i.e., wheel lock, slip, and aggravation of the riding comfort, are studied here based on a prototype EV with a function that can distribute the braking torque to the front and rear wheels according to driving conditions. As a result, electric braking control methods using the estimated vehicle speed, acceleration, and load movement are proposed that can prevent vehicles from experiencing wheel lock and slip phenomena and can improve the riding comfort regardless of a driver's braking pedal operations.

This zone will gradually expand with decreasing load to finally encompass the entire line cycle.

An active-clamp circuit is introduced here to clamp the switch turn-off voltage spikes effectively and to recycle the leakage energy. Both the main switches and the auxiliary switches are ZVT during the whole switching transition. Meanwhile, the output diode reverse-recovery problem is alleviated because the leakage inductance of the coupled inductors is in series with the output diode. Furthermore, a family of ZVT interleaved boost converters for high efficiency and high step-up DC-DC conversion is deduced.

This paper explores a technique of artificial neural network (ANN) model based on similar days (SD) method in order to forecast day-ahead electricity price in the PJM market. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, publicly available data acquired from the PJM Interconnection were used for training and testing the ANN. The factors impacting the electricity price forecasting, including time factors, load factors, and historical price factors, are discussed. Comparison of forecasting performance of the proposed ANN model with that of forecasts obtained from similar days method is presented. Daily and weekly mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of reasonably small value and forecast mean square error (FMSE) of less than 7$/MWh were obtained for the PJM data, which has correlation coefficient of determination of 0.6744 between load and electricity price. Simulation results show that the proposed ANN model based on similar days method is capable of forecasting locational marginal price (LMP) in the PJM market efficiently and accurately.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2007.907386","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4349103","Day-ahead electricity market;neural network;price forecasting;similarity technique","Neural networks;Economic forecasting;Artificial neural networks;Predictive models;Load forecasting;Electricity supply industry;Energy management;Risk management;Power generation economics;Industrial economics","electricity supply industry;load forecasting;mean square error methods;neural nets;power engineering computing;power markets;pricing;risk management","electricity price forecasting;artificial neural network;mean absolute percentage error;MAPE;forecast mean square error;FMSE;correlation coefficient;PJM market;similar days method;economic optimization;electric energy industry;risk management;locational marginal price","","141","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Lab., The Hague","IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","","2007","55","3","715","722","A new and very fast low-sidelobe pattern synthesis method for planar array antennas with periodic element spacing is described. The basic idea of the method is that since the array factor is related to the element excitations through an inverse Fourier transform, the element excitations can be derived from the array factor through a direct Fourier transform. Starting with an initial set of suitable element excitations the array factor is calculated. After matching the array factor to the prescribed pattern, an updated set of excitations is obtained through a direct Fourier transform performed on the matched array factor. From this updated set, only the samples associated with the aperture are retained, where after a new array factor is calculated. The whole process is repeated until the updated array factor does not violate any longer the pattern requirements. The proposed synthesis method provides significant improvements in terms of performance, computational speed, flexibility, and ease of implementation in software to the methods described in reviewed literature. A number of representative examples are presented to demonstrate the various unique capabilities of the method.

Thus, energy-efficient routing protocol in wireless sensor networks is necessary for increasing the network lifetime and is also influenced by many challenging factors in terms of energy, processing, and storage capacities. In this paper, we designed and implemented a reliable energy aware routing (REAR) protocol for wireless sensor networks and evaluated the performance of REAR by comparing with existing routing protocols. REAR considers residual energy capacity of each sensor node in establishing routing paths and supports multi-path routing protocol for reliable data transmission.

Two orthogonal modes in the patch are excited by using the crossed slots, and a single L-shaped feed provides a 90deg phase shift between two orthogonal slots.

The subjects used professional Java tools to perform several change tasks on two alternative Java systems with different degrees of complexity. The results of this experiment do not support the hypotheses that pair programming in general reduces the time required to solve the tasks correctly or increases the proportion of correct solutions. On the other hand, there is a significant 84 percent increase in effort to perform the tasks correctly. However, on the more complex system, the pair programmers had a 48 percent increase in the proportion of correct solutions but no significant differences in the time taken to solve the tasks correctly. For the simpler system, there was a 20 percent decrease in time taken but no significant differences in correctness. However, the moderating effect of system complexity depends on the programmer expertise of the subjects. The observed benefits of pair programming in terms of correctness on the complex system apply mainly to juniors, whereas the reductions in duration to perform the tasks correctly on the simple system apply mainly to intermediates and seniors.

Two different structures are examined. One is a diamond dipole over an EBG with square patch elements optimized by hand and the other an open sleeve dipole over an EBG optimized by a genetic algorithm (GA). Both configurations demonstrate that a low profile dipole antenna over an EBG can have a broad bandwidth. Careful design of both is required and in particular for best results, the antenna-EBG system should be optimized together, rather than as separate components. The performance is compared to an absorber backed wideband dipole antenna and it is found that the gain is significantly increased, whilst the bandwidth is reduced. In general, for the diamond dipole antenna return loss bandwidths of over 2:1 (67%) have been achieved, although radiation pattern control is difficult and reduces the bandwidth to the order of 1.4:1 (33%). The sleeve dipole over an EBG achieved a bandwidth of 1.28:1 (26%). The realized gain, which is power gain reduced by input match loss, of both structures are approximately the same.

With the source/drain extension doping controlled at the outer edges of the spacer, the thickness of the spacer determines the channel length. Optimization reduces the sensitivity of the device threshold voltage to the fluctuations in silicon thickness (by 32%) and gate length (by 73%). Our analysis shows that optimization of spacer thickness results in 65% reduction in SRAM cell leakage and improves cell read-failure probability (by 200 X) compared to conventional FinFET SRAM. Access time of an SRAM cell designed with optimized devices is comparable to conventional SRAM. We also compared the optimized-spacer-thickness SRAM cell with one designed using longer gate length and minimum-spacer-thickness transistors.

A WMN has a hybrid network infrastructure with a backbone and an access network and usually is operated in both ad hoc and infrastructure modes with self-configuration and self-organization capabilities. In this article, we review security challenges, attacks, and countermeasures in the physical, medium access control (MAC), and network layers of wireless mesh backbone and access networks.

Together with communication systems, power electronics are the key enabling technology to meet these challenges. This paper addresses several utility applications for power electronics, some of which are in use already today though market penetration is still low. In the field of high power inverters, conventional 3-level hard-switching converters as presently used e.g. in wind turbines are presented alongside with soft-switching converters and their possible applications such as STATCOMs or mini-turbines. The possibility of using DC instead of AC transmission and distribution systems will be discussed. DC systems have already been used for several decades to transmit bulk power. New opportunities for the use of modern VSC-HVDC will be shown, such as DC distribution systems. For this novel application, new technologies are needed, such as multi-megawatt DC-DC converters and DC circuit breakers; possible concepts for these technologies will be addressed. Cycloconverters, a rather conventional technology, have been applied recently in innovative ways to increase the efficiencies of very high-power pumped- hydro storage systems. Due to the fact that the development of new converter systems is always strongly related to the available device technology, future high-power devices will finally be discussed.","2164-5264","978-1-4244-0644-9","10.1109/PEDS.2007.4487666","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4487666","","Power electronics;Medium voltage;Metals industry;Steel;Paper mills;Power quality;Large scale integration;Renewable energy resources;Inverters;Wind turbines","circuit breakers;cycloconvertors;DC transmission networks;DC-DC power convertors;distribution networks;HVDC power transmission;power supply quality;pumped-storage power stations;renewable energy sources;static VAr compensators","power electronics;utility applications;medium-voltage converters;industrial drives;power quality;large scale integration;renewable energy sources;market penetration;high power inverters;hard-switching converters;STATCOM;mini-turbines;DC transmission systems;DC distribution systems;VSC-HVDC;DC-DC converters;DC circuit breakers;cycloconverters;high-power pumped-hydrostorage systems","","39","","43","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unlike beamforming, which presumes a high correlation between signals either transmitted or received by an array, the MIMO concept exploits the independence between signals at the array elements. In conventional radar, the target's radar cross section (RCS) fluctuations are regarded as a nuisance parameter that degrades radar performance. The novelty of MIMO radar is that it provides measures to overcome those degradations or even utilizes the RCS fluctuations for new applications. This paper explores how transmit diversity can improve the direction finding performance of a radar utilizing an antenna array at the receiver. To harness diversity, the transmit antennas have to be widely separated, while for direction finding, the receive antennas have to be closely spaced.

Several frequency estimation techniques have been developed and are used to help the induction machine fault detection and diagnosis. This paper presents a technique to improve the fault detection technique by using the classical multiple signal classification (MUSIC) method. This method is a powerful tool that extracts meaningful frequencies from the signal, and it has been widely used in different areas, which include electrical machines. In the proposed application, the fault sensitive frequencies have to be found in the stator current signature. They are numerous in a given frequency range, and they are affected by the signal-to-noise ratio. Then, the MUSIC method takes a long computation time to find many frequencies by increasing the dimension of the autocorrelation matrix. To solve this problem, an algorithm that is based on zooming in a specific frequency range is proposed with MUSIC in order to improve the performances of frequency extraction. Moreover, the method is integrated as a part of MUSIC to estimate the frequency signal dimension order based on classification of autocorrelation matrix eigenvalues. The proposed algorithm has been applied to detect a rotor broken bar fault in a three-phase squirrel-cage induction machine under different loads and in steady-state condition.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2007.899826","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4278024","Electric variables measurement;fault diagnosis;Fourier transforms;frequency estimation;induction machines;multidimensional signal processing;pattern classification","Frequency estimation;Induction machines;Fault detection;Multiple signal classification;Electrical fault detection;Stators;Autocorrelation;Fault diagnosis;Signal to noise ratio;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;fault diagnosis;frequency estimation;matrix algebra;rotors;signal classification;squirrel cage motors;stators","high-resolution frequency estimation method;three-phase induction machine fault detection;alternating-current electrical machines;multiple signal classification method;stator current signature;signal-to-noise ratio;MUSIC method;frequency extraction;autocorrelation matrix eigenvalues;rotor broken bar fault;three-phase squirrel-cage induction machine","","219","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A realistic assessment should consider the effects of practical channel estimation schemes. This paper considers pilot symbol aided channel estimation for cooperation diversity systems. Since the overall channel in AF systems is different from conventional cellular channels, the channel estimation problem is interesting and challenging and therefore our focus is on AF systems. The paper addresses issues such as the estimator design, pilot symbol spacing based upon realistic channel models, and an approximate bit error rate (BER) analysis that accounts for imperfect channel estimation.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2007.05875","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4251177","","Channel estimation;Relays;Diversity reception;Decoding;Land mobile radio cellular systems;Base stations;Bit error rate;Collaborative work;Government;Information analysis","cellular radio;channel coding;channel estimation;decoding;diversity reception;error statistics;radio receivers;wireless channels","amplify-forward relay based cooperation diversity system;cellular networks;base station;mobile relays;pilot symbol aided channel estimation;AF systems;pilot symbol spacing;bit error rate analysis;destination receiver;DF relays","","233","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Scalability of a video bit stream allows for media bit rate as well as for device capability adaptation. Moreover, adaptation of the bit rate of a video signal is a desirable key feature, if limitation in network resources, mostly characterized by throughput variations, varying delay or transmission errors, need to be considered. Typically, in mobile networks the throughput, delay and errors of a connection (link) depend on the current reception conditions, which are largely influenced by a number of physical factors. In order to cope with the typically varying characteristics of mobile communication channels in unicast, multicast, or broadcast services, different methods for increasing robustness and achieving quality of service are desirable. We will give an overview of SVC and its relation to mobile delivery methods.

Yu","COM DEV, Cambridge; COM DEV, Cambridge","IEEE Microwave Magazine","","2007","8","5","46","59","Following a brief review of different types of multiplexer configurations, a systematic design approach has been outlined for the design of manifold-coupled multiplexers. The piecewise approach, optimizing parts of the multiplexer separately in repeated cycles while converging upon an optimal solution, has proved to be very effective for most practical applications. The technique is readily applicable to manifold multiplexers incorporating an arbitrary number of channels, regardless of their bandwidths and channel separations. There are no restrictions on the design and implementation of channel filters onto the manifold; they may be asymmetric, and may incorporate transmission zeros, group delay equalization zeros, or both. The manifold itself is a transmission line, be it a coaxial line or a rectangular waveguide or some other low-loss structure. The costly EM simulation is used economically on manifold junctions and channel filters through the use of space-mapping optimization techniques, where EM-based simulators are used to fine-model each multiplexer channel and coupling matrix representation is used to coarse-model the performance. Fine details such as tuning screws may be included in the design process. This design procedure takes into account the effects of dispersion and spurious modes and, as a result, the overall design and final tuning time can be significantly reduced.","1557-9581","","10.1109/MMM.2007.904715","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4383435","","Multiplexing;Filters;Transmission line matrix methods;Process design;Bandwidth;Filtering theory;Delay;Coaxial components;Rectangular waveguides;Couplings","channel bank filters;coaxial cables;computational electromagnetics;equalisers;multiplexing equipment;rectangular waveguides;transmission lines","manifold-coupled multiplexers;piecewise approach;channel separations;channel filters;transmission zeros;group delay equalization zeros;transmission line;coaxial line;rectangular waveguide;low-loss structure;EM simulation;space-mapping optimization techniques;coupling matrix representation","","106","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

By using third-order LCL filters the level of the switching frequency current components can be reduced more effectively. However, because of the resonance phenomenon of the supply filter and the active filter wide operating bandwidth, the use of the LCL filter in the active filter applications is challenging. This paper compares an active and a passive method for LCL filter resonance damping, assesses their suitability for the active power filter application and presents their benefits and drawbacks. The passively damped LCL filter utilizes a control system designed for an active filter with a first-order L type filter, while the active damping method examined is based on the cascaded control of the mains side inductor and the capacitor currents. First, the frequency responses of the transfer function models are examined and second, the topologies are studied through experimental tests. The results presented show that both topologies filter the harmonics effectively and the switching ripple is attenuated. The active method requires more current sensors, while additional damping resistors are needed in the passively damped system. However, there are only slight differences both in the filtering results and the power losses.","2377-6617","978-1-4244-0654-8","10.1109/PESC.2007.4342488","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4342488","","Active filters;Passive filters;Power filters;Resonance;Damping;Band pass filters;Power harmonic filters;Control systems;Topology;Attenuation","active filters;power filters;resonance;transfer functions","voltage-source active power filter;resonance damping;third-order LCL filters;transfer function models;current sensors;power losses","","35","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The frequency is stepped linearly with a constant frequency change, and range cells are formed by fast Fourier transform processing. The covered bandwidth defines the range resolution, and the length of the frequency step restricts the nonambiguous range interval. A random choice of the transmitted frequencies suppresses the range ambiguity, improves covert detection, and reduces the signal interference between adjacent sensors. As a result of the random modulation, however, a noise component is added to the range/Doppler sidelobes. In this paper, relationships of random step frequency radar are compared with frequency-modulated continuous wave noise radar and the statistical characteristics of the ambiguity function and the sidelobe noise floor are analyzed. Algorithms are investigated, which reduce the sidelobes and the noise-floor contribution from strong dominating reflectors in the scene.

Can a machine be endowed with such an intrinsic motivation system? This is the question we study in this paper, presenting a number of computational systems that try to capture this drive towards novel or curious situations. After discussing related research coming from developmental psychology, neuroscience, developmental robotics, and active learning, this paper presents the mechanism of Intelligent Adaptive Curiosity, an intrinsic motivation system which pushes a robot towards situations in which it maximizes its learning progress. This drive makes the robot focus on situations which are neither too predictable nor too unpredictable, thus permitting autonomous mental development. The complexity of the robot's activities autonomously increases and complex developmental sequences self-organize without being constructed in a supervised manner. Two experiments are presented illustrating the stage-like organization emerging with this mechanism. In one of them, a physical robot is placed on a baby play mat with objects that it can learn to manipulate. Experimental results show that the robot first spends time in situations which are easy to learn, then shifts its attention progressively to situations of increasing difficulty, avoiding situations in which nothing can be learned.

While this approach has extensively been employed in narrowband (antenna) array beamforming, it is typically not used for broadband (microphone) array beamforming due to the uncontrolled amount of speech distortion introduced by a narrowband SNR criterion. In this paper, we show how the distortion of the desired signal can be controlled by a single-channel post-filter, resulting in a performance comparable to the generalized minimum variance distortionless response beamformer, where arbitrary transfer functions relate the source and the microphones. Results are given both for directional and diffuse noise. A novel gradient ascent adaptation algorithm is presented, and its good convergence properties are experimentally revealed by comparison with alternatives from the literature. A key feature of the proposed beamformer is that it operates blindly, i.e., it neither requires knowledge about the array geometry nor an explicit estimation of the transfer functions from source to sensors or the direction-of-arrival.","1558-7924","","10.1109/TASL.2007.898454","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4244540","Blind beamforming;generalized eigenvalue decomposition;microphone arrays;speech distortion","Array signal processing;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Sensor arrays;Microphone arrays;Signal to noise ratio;Acoustic distortion;Narrowband;Broadband antennas;Antenna arrays;Transfer functions","acoustic signal processing;array signal processing;direction-of-arrival estimation;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;microphone arrays;transfer functions","narrowband array beamforming;single-channel post-filter;arbitrary transfer function;microphones;gradient ascent adaptation algorithm;direction-of-arrival;spatially colored noise;sensor array;generalized eigenvalue decomposition;blind acoustic beamforming","","81","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recent advances in power electronics have made the multilevel concept practical. In fact, the concept is so advantageous that several major drives manufacturers have obtained recent patents on multilevel power converters and associated switching techniques. Multilevel inverters have been an important development in recent years, owing to their capability to increase the voltage and power delivered to the motor with semiconductors which are available today. Owing to this high power, these multilevel inverters have a big impact on production, generating important losses when they fail. For this reason, the investigation of methods to increase the reliability of these inverters is of high interest. It is evident that the multilevel concept will be a prominent choice for power electronic systems in future years, especially for medium-voltage operation. This paper proposes a comparison between different switching strategies for cascaded multilevel (CML) inverters, based on sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM) and space vector modulation (SVM). The work strive hard to present the scrutiny that has been made between different open loop pulse width modulation (PWM) control technique for five level CML voltage source inverter.

This paper describes the implementation and validation of a hidden Markov model (HMM) for estimating human affective state in real time, using robot motions as the stimulus. Inputs to the system are physiological signals such as heart rate, perspiration rate, and facial muscle contraction. Affective state was estimated using a two- dimensional valence-arousal representation. A robot manipulator was used to generate motions expected during human-robot interaction, and human subjects were asked to report their response to these motions. The human physiological response was also measured. Robot motions were generated using both a nominal potential field planner and a recently reported safe motion planner that minimizes the potential collision forces along the path. The robot motions were tested with 36 subjects. This data was used to train and validate the HMM model.

Thus, the topology is highly suited for high performance applications. The LIFEcar project is aimed at producing the world's first hydrogen sports car, and the first YASA motors have been developed specifically for the vehicle.

The incremental conductance (INC) method is widely used in the PVPS due to its succinctness and high tracking efficiency. The conventional INC algorithm using a fixed iteration step-size is impossible to achieve rapid dynamic response and good steady tracking accuracy simultaneously, because if the step-size is increased for rapid dynamic response, the tracking accuracy is decreased and vice versa.

For the gate electrode and the gate dielectric, which classically use polysilicon and with some amount of nitridation, new materials might be needed. Also, a new transistor architecture might be required that deviates from the planar structure. Thanks to their inherent suppression of short-channel effects, reduced drain-induced barrier lowering and good scalability, multi-gate devices such as fin-shaped field-effect transistors (FinFETs) are considered as possible candidates for device scaling at the end of International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors. As such, they form a first step between a planar architecture and a silicon nanowire. In this paper, we demonstrate with functional prototypes of analog and RF circuits that the combination of a new gate stack with a FinFET transistor architecture outperforms comparable circuit realizations in planar bulk CMOS for low to moderate speed. Further, the FinFETs exhibit less leakage and show less intra-die variability than their planar bulk counterpart. In the microwave and millimeter-wave frequency region, planar bulk CMOS is still superior. The main challenge for FinFET performance in the coming years is the improvement of the maximum cutoff frequency, which is nowadays limited to 100 GHz.","1558-0806","","10.1109/TCSI.2007.907866","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4383258","Electrostatic discharges (ESDs);fin-shaped field-effect transistor (FinFET);mixed analog integrated circuits;nanotechnology","FinFETs;Radio frequency;Performance gain;Circuit noise;Acoustical engineering;Semiconductor device noise;Linearity;Electrodes;Dielectric materials;Scalability","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;dielectric materials;MOSFET;nanotechnology;nitridation;silicon","frequency 100 GHz;analog circuit;RF circuit;CMOS downscaling;nanoscale;CMOS transistor;gate electrode;gate dielectric;polysilicon;nitridation;multigate devices;fin-shaped field-effect transistors;planar architecture;silicon nanowire;planar bulk CMOS;frequency 100 GHz","","24","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, in power electronic applications control, with objectives like fast response of system on reference and disturbance change, is of primary importance. This paper provides a novel and a systematic design approach for applying signal processing methods (like modified adaptive selective harmonic elimination algorithms) as an addition to conventional control. Thus, both control objectives like fast transient response and efficient harmonic (disturbance) filtering are achieved. The filtering algorithm does not interfere and has minimal impact on the stability of the primary control loop. Its sole function is to eliminate undesirable higher harmonic components from selected variable (current or voltage) and it requires only knowledge of the frequency of the component to be eliminated.

First, the dynamic model of an indirect field-oriented LIM drive is derived. Next, a backstepping sliding-mode approach is designed to compensate the uncertainties occurring in the motion control system. Moreover, the uncertainties are lumped and the upper bound of the lumped uncertainty is necessary in the design of the backstepping sliding-mode controller. However, the upper bound of the lumped uncertainty is difficult to obtain in advance of practical applications. Therefore, an adaptive law is derived to adapt the value of the lumped uncertainty in real time, and an adaptive backstepping sliding-mode control law is the result. Then, an FPGA chip is adopted to implement the indirect field-oriented mechanism and the developed control algorithms for possible low-cost and high-performance industrial applications. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified by some experimental results.

Our experimental system is a pneumatically actuated bipedal robot called ""Mowgli"". Mowgli's artificial musculoskeletal system consists of six McKibben pneumatic muscle actuators including bi-articular muscle and two legs with hip, knee, and ankle joints. Mowgli can reach jump heights of more than 50% of its body height and can land softly. Our results show a proximo-distal sequence of joint extensions during jumping despite simultaneous motor activity. Extensions in the whole body motion are caused by the compliance and the natural dynamics of the legs. In addition to the experiments with the real robot, we also simulated two types of open loop controllers for vertical jumping with disturbance. We found that the model controlled by open loop motor command through a muscle-tendon mechanism could jump robustly.

By taking this new scenario into account, a new method to generate switching three-level pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) patterns to meet specific grid codes is presented. The proposed method, which is named selective harmonic mitigation PWM , generates switching three-level PWM patterns with high quality from the point of view of harmonic content, avoiding the elimination of some specific harmonics and studying all harmonics and the total harmonic distortion as a global problem by using a general-purpose random-search heuristic algorithm. This fact leads to a drastic reduction or even avoidance of the bulky and costly grid connection tuned filters of power systems. Any harmonic shaping can be considered due to the flexibility of the method. Power devices switching constraints are considered to obtain directly applicable results. As a practical example, limits from one actual grid code have been used to get the experimental results by means of a 150-kVA three-level diode-clamped converter test bench. Comparisons between the proposed technique, optimized PWM and Selective Harmonic Elimination methods have been carried out.

Because the temporal profiles of such energy sources exhibit great variability due to dynamic weather patterns, an important problem is designing an adaptive duty-cycling mechanism that allows sensor nodes to maintain their power supply at sufficient levels (energy neutral operation) by adapting to changing environmental conditions. Existing techniques to address this problem are minimally adaptive and assume a priori knowledge of the energy profile. While such approaches are reasonable in environments that exhibit low variance, we find that it is highly inefficient in more variable scenarios. We introduce a new technique for solving this problem based on results from adaptive control theory and show that we achieve better performance than previous approaches on a broader class of energy source data sets. Additionally, we include a tunable mechanism for reducing the variance of the node's duty cycle over time, which is an important feature in tasks such as event monitoring.

The system employs two parallel GMM classifiers for discriminating screams from noise and gunshots from noise, respectively. Each classifier is trained using different features, chosen from a set of both conventional and innovative audio features. The location of the acoustic source which has produced the sound event is estimated by computing the time difference of arrivals of the signal at a microphone array and using linear-correction least square localization algorithm. Experimental results show that our system can detect events with a precision of 93% at a false rejection rate of 5% when the SNR is 10dB, while the source direction can be estimated with a precision of one degree.

The algorithm takes advantage of switching redundancies to adjust the switching times of selected switching states and thus maintaining the capacitor voltages balanced without adversely affecting the system's performance.

The adaptive algorithm has been one of the approaches to prevent the divergence problem of the EKF when precise knowledge on the system models are not available. One of the adaptive methods is called the strong tracking Kalman filter (STKF), which is essentially a nonlinear smoother algorithm that employs suboptimal multiple fading factors, in which the softening factors are involved. Traditional approach for selecting the softening factors heavily relies on personal experience or computer simulation. In order to resolve this shortcoming, a novel scheme called the adaptive fuzzy strong tracking Kalman filter (AFSTKF) is carried out. In the AFSTKF, the fuzzy logic reasoning system based on the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) model is incorporated into the STKF. By monitoring the degree of divergence (DOD) parameters based on the innovation information, the fuzzy logic adaptive system (FLAS) is designed for dynamically adjusting the softening factor according to the change in vehicle dynamics. GPS navigation processing using the AFSTKF will be simulated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

There are various schemes for 3-D display taxonomy; the basic categories adopted for this paper are: holography where the image is produced by wavefront reconstruction, volumetric where the image is produced within a volume of space and multiple image displays where two or more images are seen across the viewing field. In an ideal world a stereoscopic display would produce images in real time that exhibit all the characteristics of the original scene. This would require the wavefront to be reproduced accurately, but currently this can only be achieved using holographic techniques. Volumetric displays provide both vertical and horizontal parallax so that several viewers can see 3-D images that exhibit no accommodation/convergence rivalry. Multiple image displays fall within three fundamental types: holoform in which a large number of views give smooth motion parallax and hence a hologram-like appearance, multiview where a series of discrete views are presented across viewing field and binocular where only two views are presented in regions that may occupy fixed positions or follow viewers' eye positions by employing head tracking. Holography enables 3-D scenes to be encoded into an interference pattern, however, this places constraints on the display resolution necessary to reconstruct a scene. Although holography may ultimately offer the solution for 3DTV, the problem of capturing naturally lit scenes will first have to be solved and holography is unlikely to provide a short-term solution due to limitations in current enabling technologies. Liquid crystal, digital micromirror, optically addressed liquid crystal and acoustooptic spatial light modulators (SLMs) have been employed as suitable spatial light modulation devices in holography. Liquid crystal SLMs are generally favored owing to the commercial availability of high fill factor, high resolution addressable devices. Volumetric displays provide both vertical and horizontal parallax and several viewers are able to see a 3-D image that exhibits no accommodation/convergence rivalry. However, the principal disadvantages of these displays are: the images are generally transparent, the hardware tends to be complex and non-Lambertian intensity distribution cannot be displayed. Multiple image displays take many forms and it is likely that one or more of these will provide the solution(s) for the first generation of 3DTV displays.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2007.905377","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4358676","Holography;TV;3-D displays;Holography;Three-dimensional displays and TV","Liquid crystal displays;Holography;Liquid crystal devices;Layout;Optical modulation;Image coding;Image reconstruction;Digital modulation;Three dimensional displays;Taxonomy","data compression;holography;image coding;liquid crystal displays;micromirrors;spatial light modulators;stereo image processing;television displays","3DTV displays;image acquisition;image compression;image coding transmission;image reproduction;holography;stereoscopic display;volumetric displays;digital micromirror;optically addressed liquid crystal;acoustooptic spatial light modulators","","159","","108","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, we apply fast Fourier transform (FFT) to individual points along this line of interest to capitalize on the pulse's thermal propagation effect. Finally, we use an adaptive estimation function on the average FFT outcome to quantify the pulse. We have carried out experiments on a data set of 34 subjects and compared the pulse computed from our thermal signal analysis method to concomitant ground-truth measurements obtained through a standard contact sensor (piezo-electric transducer). The performance of the new method ranges from 88.52% to 90.33% depending on the clarity of the vessel's thermal imprint.

This analysis makes no prior assumption on the network topology and facilitates free-to-choose levels for the high-efficiency power back-off points. By comparing the results of this analysis with prior work, it is shown that very specific drive conditions apply to traditional three-way Doherty amplifier implementations to obtain simultaneously high-efficiency and high-linearity operation. To support these conclusions, a 15-W three-way Doherty amplifier was constructed using Philips GEN4 LDMOS devices featuring three separate inputs to independently drive the main and peaking devices. By testing this three-way amplifier with a custom-built measurement setup, capable of providing multiple digitally controlled coherent RF input signals with high spectral purity, a unique flexible amplifier concept is created resulting in a record-high efficiency for LDMOS-based Doherty amplifiers over a 12-dB back-off power range","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2007.895160","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4195671","Analysis;base station;coherent signals;Doherty;high efficiency;high power;linearity;mixed signal;power amplifier (PA)","Radiofrequency amplifiers;High power amplifiers;Linearity;Broadband amplifiers;Testing;Radio frequency;Multiaccess communication;Power amplifiers;Network topology;Operational amplifiers","linearisation techniques;MOS analogue integrated circuits;power amplifiers","mixed-signal approach;power-combining network;three-way Doherty amplifier;Philips GEN4 LDMOS devices;digitally controlled coherent RF input signals;base station;15 W","","72","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The parallel plates are partially filled with low cost polymer material (Rexolite epsivr = 2.54) to match Luneberg's law. A planar linear tapered slot antenna (LTSA) is inserted into the air region between the parallel plates at the edge of the Luneberg lens as a feed antenna, with fine positioning to the focal point of the Luneberg lens to optimize the antenna system performance. A combined ray-optics/diffraction method is used to obtain the radiation pattern of the system and results are compared with predictions of a time domain numerical solver. Measurements done on a 10-cm Luneberg lens designed for operation at 30 GHz agree very well with predictions. For this prototype, 3-dB E- and if-plane beamwidths of 6.6deg and 54deg respectively were obtained, and the sidelobe level in the E-plane was -17.7-dB.

"Complementary Stability and Loop Shaping for Improved Human–Robot Interaction","S. P. Buerger; N. Hogan","Intelligent Syst., Robotics & Cybern. Group, Sandia Nat. Labs., Albuquerque, NM; NA","IEEE Transactions on Robotics","","2007","23","2","232","244","Robots intended for high-force interaction with humans face particular challenges to achieve performance and stability. They require low and tunable endpoint impedance as well as high force capacity, and demand actuators with low intrinsic impedance, the ability to exhibit high impedance (relative to the human subject), and a high ratio of force to weight. Force-feedback control can be used to improve actuator performance, but causes well-known interaction stability problems. This paper presents a novel method to design actuator controllers for physically interactive machines. A loop-shaping design method is developed from a study of fundamental differences between interaction control and the more common servo problem. This approach addresses the interaction problem by redefining stability and performance, using a computational approach to search parameter spaces and displaying variations in performance as control parameters are adjusted. A measure of complementary stability is introduced, and the coupled stability problem is transformed to a robust stability problem using limited knowledge of the environment dynamics (in this case, the human). Design examples show that this new measure improves performance beyond the current best-practice stability constraint (passivity). The controller was implemented on an interactive robot, verifying stability and performance. Testing showed that the new controller out-performed a state-of-the-art controller on the same system","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2007.892229","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4154828","Actuators;control systems;force control;haptics;man–machine systems;robots","Impedance;Actuators;Robust stability;Design methodology;Control systems;Human robot interaction;Face;Force control;Weight control;Servomechanisms","actuators;man-machine systems;robots;robust control;servomechanisms","complementary stability;loop shaping;human-robot interaction;actuator controller design;coupled stability;robust stability;environment dynamics;interactive robot;interaction control;servo mechanisms","","131","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Training a classifier requires accessing a large collection of data. Releasing person-specific data, such as customer data or patient records, may pose a threat to an individual's privacy. Even after removing explicit identifying information such as Name and SSN, it is still possible to link released records back to their identities by matching some combination of nonidentifying attributes such as {Sex, Zip, Birthdate}. A useful approach to combat such linking attacks, called k-anonymization, is anonymizing the linking attributes so that at least k released records match each value combination of the linking attributes. Previous work attempted to find an optimal k-anonymization that minimizes some data distortion metric. We argue that minimizing the distortion to the training data is not relevant to the classification goal that requires extracting the structure of predication on the ""future"" data. In this paper, we propose a k-anonymization solution for classification. Our goal is to find a k-anonymization, not necessarily optimal in the sense of minimizing data distortion, which preserves the classification structure.

It has recently been shown that asymmetrically clipped optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (ACO-OFDM) is more efficient in terms of optical power than conventional optical modulation techniques such as pulse position modulation (PPM). When ACO-OFDM is used, the transmitted signal has a clipped Gaussian probability distribution. We calculate the channel capacity for systems using transmitted signals with exponential and clipped Gaussian distributions, and for an ACO-OFDM system. For practical signal to noise ratios, ACO-OFDM has a slightly lower capacity than the other distributions, due to the correlation between samples caused by the ACO-OFDM modulation process. ACO-OFDM has many practical advantages including its tolerance to multipath distortion.

Although random modulations have been applied before to power converters, periodic patterns can provide some advantages. First, theoretical principles of frequency modulation using three periodic patterns for the modulating function are presented. The influence of some important modulation parameters on the EMI reduction is analyzed and some considerations about the EMI filters design are also presented. The effectiveness of such methods in terms of EMI reduction is demonstrated theoretically and confirmed with experimental results obtained from tests carried out on two converters. The first one is a 2.5 W buck converter that can be switched up to 1 MHz and the second one is a 600 W boost converter switching at 40 kHz.

Intentional falls (forward, backward, and lateral) and activities of daily living (ADL) were performed by two voluntary subjects. The results showed that measurements from the waist and head have potential to distinguish between falls and ADL.

In this paper, we explore this design style in large combinational circuit blocks and latch-to-latch datapaths and introduce a novel power gating approach to yield an improved power-performance tradeoff. We first present a multiple sleep mode power gating technique where each mode represents a different point in the wake-up overhead versus leakage savings design space. We show that the high wake-up latency and wake-up power penalty of traditional power gating limits its application to large stretches of inactivity. The multiple-mode feature allows a processor to enter power saving modes more frequently, hence, resulting in enhanced leakage savings. We apply the multimode power gating technique to datapaths where the degree of applied power gating becomes progressively stronger (harder) along the datapath. This configuration allows us to further balance wake-up overhead with leakage savings by exploiting the fact that logic circuits deep in the datapath have higher wakeup margin and hence can be strongly gated. Simulations show that multiple sleep mode capability provides an extra 17% reduction in overall leakage compared to traditional single mode gating. The multiple modes can be designed to allow state-retentive modes. The results on benchmarks show that a single state-retentive mode can reduce leakage by 19% while preserving state of the circuit.","1557-9999","","10.1109/TVLSI.2007.904101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4351986","Bias generation;low-power design;multiple modes;power gating","Rails;Delay;Power generation;Subthreshold current;Leakage current;Combinational circuits;Logic circuits;Circuit simulation;Energy consumption;Voltage","CMOS logic circuits;combinational circuits;integrated circuit design;leakage currents;logic design;low-power electronics","leakage reduction;multimode power gating;leakage power;low power applications;combinational circuit blocks;latch-to-latch datapaths;wake-up latency;wake-up power penalty;logic circuits;intermediate strength power gating;technology scaling;sleep mode power gating","","79","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, a neural network classification is applied to the fault diagnosis of a MLID system. Five multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks are used to identify the type and location of occurring faults from inverter output voltage measurement. The neural network design process is clearly described. The classification performance of the proposed network between normal and abnormal condition is about 90%, and the classification performance among fault features is about 85%.

These systems have become so interconnected, one relying on another, that disruption of one may lead to disruptions in all. The approach taken in this research is to model these systems by explicitly identifying these interconnections or interdependencies. Definitions of five types of infrastructure inter-dependencies are presented and incorporated into a network flows mathematical representation, i.e., an interdependent layer network model. Using the lower Manhattan region of New York, for illustrative purposes, the implementation of the model is shown. First, the data requirements are presented with realistic data on the interdependent infrastructure systems of power, telecommunications, and subways. Next, a scenario is given that causes major disruption in the services provided by these infrastructures and demonstrates the use of the model in guiding restoration of services. The paper concludes with a discussion of accomplishments and opportunities for future work.","1558-2442","","10.1109/TSMCC.2007.905859","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4343992","Civil infrastructure systems;emergency management;mathematical programming;networks","Power system modeling;Collision mitigation;Societies;Transportation;Mathematical model;Power system restoration;Disaster management;Power system management;Mathematical programming;Costs","civil engineering computing;disasters;emergency services;mathematical programming;network theory (graphs);public administration","interdependent civil infrastructure system;network flow approach;interdependent layer network model;emergency management;mathematical programming;disaster management","","156","","53","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Effective indexing and retrieval from surveillance video databases are very important. Although there are many ways to represent the content of video clips in current video retrieval algorithms, there still exists a semantic gap between users and retrieval systems. Visual surveillance systems supply a platform for investigating semantic-based video retrieval. In this paper, a semantic-based video retrieval framework for visual surveillance is proposed. A cluster-based tracking algorithm is developed to acquire motion trajectories. The trajectories are then clustered hierarchically using the spatial and temporal information, to learn activity models. A hierarchical structure of semantic indexing and retrieval of object activities, where each individual activity automatically inherits all the semantic descriptions of the activity model to which it belongs, is proposed for accessing video clips and individual objects at the semantic level. The proposed retrieval framework supports various queries including queries by keywords, multiple object queries, and queries by sketch. For multiple object queries, succession and simultaneity restrictions, together with depth and breadth first orders, are considered. For sketch-based queries, a method for matching trajectories drawn by users to spatial trajectories is proposed.

Typical roadblocks to consistent performance include limited capture range, noise sensitivity, and poor convergence to concavities. This paper proposes a new external force for active contours, called vector field convolution (VFC), to address these problems. VFC is calculated by convolving the edge map generated from the image with the user-defined vector field kernel. We propose two structures for the magnitude function of the vector field kernel, and we provide an analytical method to estimate the parameter of the magnitude function. Mixed VFC is introduced to alleviate the possible leakage problem caused by choosing inappropriate parameters. We also demonstrate that the standard external force and the gradient vector flow (GVF) external force are special cases of VFC in certain scenarios.

Because of the capacitance difference between the capacitor cells, after a number of deep discharging/charging cycles, the voltage difference between cells will be enlarged. This will accelerate the aging of the weak super capacitors and affect the output power. So, a management system with an equalization function is essential.

This paper breaks that old paradigm by relaxing the static phasor concept to a dynamic one, i.e., the dynamic phasor, which is one complex time function with movement freedom. This paper presents the algorithm to approximate the dynamic phasor by a second-order Taylor polynomial and compares its phasor estimate to the traditional one. This approximation leads to the definition of the phasor state vector, which contains not only the estimate of the dynamic phasor but the estimates of its derivatives as well. These new estimates improve the accuracy of oscillation estimation by including new Taylor details into the interpolation process.

This allows tight control over two of the converter ports, while the third port provides the power balance in the system. The switching sequence ensures a clamping path for the energy of the leakage inductance of the transformer at all times. This energy is further utilized to achieve zero-voltage switching for all primary switches for a wide range of source and load conditions. Basic steady-state analysis of the proposed converter is included, together with a suggested structure for feedback control. Key experimental results are presented that validate the converter operation and confirm its ability to achieve tight independent control over two power processing paths.

"High-Rate Communication for Underwater Acoustic Channels Using Multiple Transmitters and Space–Time Coding: Receiver Structures and Experimental Results","S. Roy; T. M. Duman; V. McDonald; J. G.

Recent advances in information theory have shown that significant capacity gains can be achieved by using multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems and space-time coding techniques for rich scattering environments. This is especially significant for the UWA channel where the usable bandwidth is severely limited due to frequency-dependent attenuation. In this paper, we propose to use space-time coding and iterative decoding techniques to obtain high data rates and reliability over shallow-water, medium-range UWA channels. In particular, we propose to use space-time trellis codes (STTCs), layered space-time codes (LSTCs) and their combinations along with three low-complexity adaptive equalizer structures at the receiver. We consider multiband transmissions where the available bandwidth is divided into several subbands with guard bands in between them. We describe the theoretical basis of the proposed receivers along with a comprehensive set of experimental results obtained by processing data collected from real UWA communications experiments carried out in the Pacific Ocean. We demonstrate that by using space-time coding at the transmitter and sophisticated iterative processing at the receiver, we can obtain data rates and spectral efficiencies that are not possible with single transmitter systems at similar ranges and depths. In particular, we have demonstrated reliable transmission at a data rate of 48 kb/s in 23 kHz of bandwidth, and 12 kb/s in 3 kHz of bandwidth (a spectral efficiency of 4 bs-1Hz-1) at a 2-km range.","1558-1691","","10.1109/JOE.2007.899275","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4443172","Iterative equalization;multiple-input–multiple- output (MIMO);space–time codes;successive interference cancellation (SIC);turbo codes;underwater acoustic (UWA) communications","Underwater communication;Underwater acoustics;Transmitters;Bandwidth;MIMO;Information theory;Acoustic scattering;Frequency;Attenuation;Iterative decoding","antenna arrays;iterative decoding;MIMO communication;space-time codes;trellis codes;underwater acoustic communication","high-rate communication;underwater acoustic channels;multiple transmitters;receiver structures;multiple antennas;underwater acoustic communications;multiple-input-multiple-output systems;space-time coding techniques;frequency-dependent attenuation;iterative decoding techniques;space-time trellis codes;low-complexity adaptive equalizer structures;multiband transmissions","","156","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The random packet loss is assumed to obey the Bernoulli random binary distribution, and the parameter uncertainties are norm-bounded and enter into both the system and output matrices. In the presence of random packet losses, an observer-based feedback controller is designed to robustly exponentially stabilize the networked system in the sense of mean square and also achieve the prescribed Hinfin disturbance-rejection-attenuation level. Both the stability-analysis and controller-synthesis problems are thoroughly investigated.

Possible parallel operation situations of two APFs are investigated, and then the proposed topology is analyzed. The filters are coupled in a combined topology in which one filter is connected in a feedback loop and the other is in a feedforward loop for harmonic compensation. Thus, both active power filters bring their own characteristic advantages, i.e., the feedback filter improves the steady-state performance of the harmonic mitigation and the feedforward filter improves the dynamic response. Another characteristic of the proposed topology is the possibility of joint operation of both filters either as frequency-sharing or load-sharing, with or without redundancy. The frequency-sharing operation is possible due to the control algorithm, which is based on selective harmonic compensation using equivalent harmonic integrators. Implementation details and a discussion on the efficiency improvement for various switching frequencies are provided. The evaluation of the proposed topology concludes that this approach is very practical for achieving both low and high order harmonic compensation and stable grid operation.

This problem is difficult because one needs to determine both the number of people in each frame and estimate their configurations. But, finding people and localizing their limbs is hard because people can move fast and unpredictably, can appear in a variety of poses and clothes, and are often surrounded by limb-like clutter. We develop a completely automatic system that works in two stages; it first builds a model of appearance of each person in a video and then it tracks by detecting those models in each frame (""tracking by model-building and detection""). We develop two algorithms that build models; one bottom-up approach groups together candidate body parts found throughout a sequence. We also describe a top-down approach that automatically builds people-models by detecting convenient key poses within a sequence. We finally show that building a discriminative model of appearance is quite helpful since it exploits structure in a background (without background-subtraction). We demonstrate the resulting tracker on hundreds of thousands of frames of unscripted indoor and outdoor activity, a feature-length film (""Run Lola Run""), and legacy sports footage (from the 2002 World Series and 1998 Winter Olympics). Experiments suggest that our system 1) can count distinct individuals, 2) can identify and track them, 3) can recover when it loses track, for example, if individuals are occluded or briefly leave the view, 4) can identify body configuration accurately, and 5) is not dependent on particular models of human motion","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.250600","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4016551","People tracking;motion capture;surveillance.","Video sequences;Tracking;Humans;Surveillance;Hidden Markov models;Buildings;Biological system modeling;Computer vision;Computer interfaces;Data mining","computer vision;image motion analysis;image sequences;video signal processing","people tracking;open vision problem;video sequence;bottom-up approach;top-down approach;image appearance model;human motion;motion capture","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Movement;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Video Recording;Whole Body Imaging","246","","47","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Signals transmitted from one user to another at distance r apart are subject to a power loss of r-alpha as well as a random phase. We identify the scaling laws of the information-theoretic capacity of the network when nodes can relay information for each other. In the case of dense networks, where the area is fixed and the density of nodes increasing, we show that the total capacity of the network scales linearly with n. This improves on the best known achievability result of n2/3 of Aeron and Saligrama. In the case of extended networks, where the density of nodes is fixed and the area increasing linearly with n, we show that this capacity scales as n2-alpha/2 for 2lesalpha<3 and radicn for a alphages3. The best known earlier result of Xie and Kumar identified the scaling law for alpha > 4. Thus, much better scaling than multihop can be achieved in dense networks, as well as in extended networks with low attenuation. The performance gain is achieved by intelligent node cooperation and distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication.

As FPGA logic capacity has grown, locally accessed FPGA embedded memory blocks have increased in importance. When targeting FPGAs, application designers often specify high-level memory functions, which exhibit a range of sizes and control structures. These logical memories must be mapped to FPGA embedded memory resources such that physical design objectives are met. In this paper, a set of power-efficient logical-to-physical RAM mapping algorithms is described, which converts user-defined memory specifications to on-chip FPGA memory block resources. These algorithms minimize RAM dynamic power by evaluating a range of possible embedded memory block mappings and selecting the most power-efficient choice. Our automated approach has been validated with both simulation of power dissipation and measurements of power dissipation on FPGA hardware. A comparison of measured power reductions to values determined via simulation confirms the accuracy of our simulation approach. Our power-aware RAM mapping algorithms have been integrated into a commercial FPGA compiler and tested with 34 large FPGA benchmarks. Through experimentation, we show that, on average, embedded memory dynamic power can be reduced by 26% and overall core dynamic power can be reduced by 6% with a minimal loss (1%) in design performance. In addition, it is shown that the availability of multiple embedded memory block sizes in an FPGA reduces embedded memory dynamic power by an additional 9.6% by giving more choices to the computer-aided design algorithms","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2006.887924","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4068934","Design automation;field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs);memory architecture;power demand","Read-write memory;Field programmable gate arrays;Random access memory;Power dissipation;Power measurement;Logic;Size control;Heuristic algorithms;Hardware;Testing","embedded systems;field programmable gate arrays;logic CAD;logic simulation;memory architecture","power-efficient RAM mapping;FPGA embedded memory blocks;field-programmable gate array;high-level memory functions;logical memories;user-defined memory specifications;dynamic power minimization;power dissipation;power reductions;FPGA compiler;computer-aided design algorithms;design automation","","19","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At the same time, much research has been done in this field, which has led to a significant increase in the prediction accuracy recently. With many ongoing research programs in the field of numerical weather prediction (NWP), as well as in the power output prediction models (transforming wind speed into electrical power output), one can expect further improvements in the future. For the time being, three measures are taken as best practices to reduce prediction errors: Combinations of different models can be done with power output forecast models as well as with NWP models (multimodel and multischeme approaches). Reductions in RMSE of up to 20% were shown with intelligent combinations. As expected, a shorter forecast horizon leads to lower prediction errors. However, the organization of the electricity market as well as the conventional generation pool has a large influence on the needed forecast horizon. The forecast error depends on the number of wind turbines and wind farms and their geographical spread. In Germany, typical forecast errors for representative wind farm forecasts are 10-15% RMSE of installed power, while the error for the control areas calculated from these representative wind farms is typically 6-7% and that for the whole of Germany only 5-6%. Whenever possible, aggregating wind power over a large area should be performed as it leads to significant reduction of forecast errors as well as short-term fluctuations. a large area should be performed as it leads to significant reduction of forecast errors as well as short-term fluctuations.","1558-4216","","10.1109/MPE.2007.906306","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4383126","","Wind forecasting;Economic forecasting;Predictive models;Wind energy;Wind farms;Error correction;Fluctuations;Accuracy;Weather forecasting;Power system modeling","power markets;weather forecasting;wind power","wind power prediction system;forecast model;shorter forecast horizon;electricity market;wind turbine;forecast error;wind farm;numerical weather prediction","","117","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The fine resolution converter, realized in 130 nm CMOS, is designed to operate over a reference clock frequency of 500 MHz but can be scaled to multi GHz operation through time interleaving. Without external calibration, the TDC is used as a 5-bit fine resolution converter with 4.65 ENOB (effective number of bits). Under this condition, the 6-bit TDC has an INL (integral non-linearity) measurement of less than 1.45 LSB and a DNL (differential non-linearity) measurement of less than 1.25 LSB. With external calibration, a reduction of more than 50% in INL/DNL nonlinearities is demonstrated improving the ENOB to 5.5 bits, pushing the TDC to a 6-bit fine resolution operation.

Free space implies that it is not practical to use optical fiber to connect the points that need to communicate or exchange telemetry data. After the cold war in the new environment of GWOT, U.S. submarines are capable of accomplishing missions that would require them to be at periscope depth, communicating critical information at high data rate with the other moving platforms. Submarines' covert surveillance abilities are capable of attaining important tactical information, however, that information may be of greatest value when it is communicated in real time, at high fidelity, to other platforms that are participating in joint operations and to high level decision makers. Free space optical communications (FSO) can provide covert, difficult to jam or intercept, high speed, broadband connectivity for submarines with other platforms. In addition, there are test scenarios that include requirements for telemetry of large volumes of data. Free space optical communications (FSO) would provide the infrastructure to support those telemetry requirements. This paper will discuss the current implementations of free space optical communications (FSO) and telemetry, and will describe concepts for integrating this capability into the existing and future DoD and submarine applications.","","978-1-4244-0936-5","10.1109/AVFOP.2007.4365728","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4365728","","Optical fiber communication;Aerospace electronics;Telemetry;Underwater vehicles;Underwater communication;Land surface;Sea surface;Optical fibers;Surveillance;Testing","military equipment;optical links;telemetry","free space optical communication;telemetry","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Quality-of-Service Driven Power and Rate Adaptation over Wireless Links","J. Tang; X. Zhang","Student Member; Texas A&M Univ., College Station","IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","","2007","6","8","3058","3068","We propose a quality-of-service (QoS) driven power and rate adaptation scheme over wireless links in mobile wireless networks. Specifically, our proposed scheme aims at maximizing the system throughput subject to a given delay QoS constraint. First, we derive an optimal adaptation policy by integrating information theory with the concept of effective capacity for a block fading channel model. Our analyses reveal an important fact that there exists a fundamental tradeoff between throughput and QoS provisioning. In particular, when the QoS constraint becomes loose, the optimal power-control policy converges to the well-known water-filling scheme, where Shannon (ergodic) capacity can be achieved. On the other hand, when the QoS constraint gets stringent, the optimal policy converges to the total channel inversion scheme under which the system operates at a constant rate. Inspired by the above observations, we then consider a more practical scenario where variable-power adaptive modulation is employed over both block fading and Markov correlated fading channels. In both cases, we derive the associated power and rate adaptation policies. The obtained results suggest that the channel correlation has a significant impact on QoS-driven power and rate adaptations. The higher the correlation is, the faster the power-control policy converges to the total channel inversion when the QoS constraint becomes more stringent. Finally, we conduct simulations to verify that the adaptation policy proposed for Markov channel models can also be applied to the more general channel models.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2007.051075","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4290047","","Quality of service;Delay;Wireless networks;Fading;Throughput;Information theory;Power system modeling;Power control;Programmable control;Adaptive control","adaptive modulation;channel capacity;fading channels;Markov processes;mobile radio;quality of service;radio links","quality-of-service driven power;rate adaptation;wireless links;mobile wireless networks;optimal adaptation policy;information theory;block fading channel model;optimal power-control policy;water-filling scheme;Shannon capacity;total channel inversion scheme;variable-power adaptive modulation;Markov correlated fading channels;channel correlation","","345","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The switched source follower combined with a resistor-switch ladder eliminates the sampling switches and achieves high linearity for a large single-ended input signal. Multistage amplifiers adopting the complementary common-source topology increase the output swing range with lower transconductance variation and reduce the power consumption. The supply voltage for the analog blocks is provided by the low drop-out regulator for a high power-supply rejection ratio (PSRR) under the noisy operation environment. The pipeline stages of the ADC are optimized in the aspect of power consumption through the iterated calculation of the sampling capacitance and transconductance. The ADC occupies an active area of 1.0 mm2 in a 90-nm CMOS process and achieves a 53-dB PSRR for a 100-MHz noise tone with the regulator and a 55.2-dB signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio for a 30-MHz 1.0-VPP single-ended input at 205 MS/s.

This paper focuses on a mushroom-type EBG structure, although the design is applicable to various EBG profiles. The patch antenna is modeled as a half-wavelength resonator of an EBG-loaded microstrip transmission line. Through a full-wave eigenmode analysis of a microstrip line on an EBG structure, it is found that the resonant patch will not see a high-impedance surface (HIS), but rather it is coupled to the EBG structure as an open cavity resonator. Due to strong near-field coupling, the propagation characteristics including the bandgap zones are very different with or without the patch cover. The use of an EBG structure as a bulk material for antennas is seen inappropriate. The EBG surface is found to have the effect of reducing the patch resonant length and bandwidth. A prototype of a microstrip line proximity fed to a patch antenna is fabricated and tested to verify the analysis.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2007.898633","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4232640","Electromagnetic bandgap (EBG);high-impedance surface (HIS);microstrip patch antenna;periodic microstrip line","Electromagnetic radiation;Periodic structures;Metamaterials;Patch antennas;Microstrip antennas;Microstrip resonators;Resonance;Couplings;Cavity resonators;Photonic band gap","antenna radiation patterns;cavity resonators;electromagnetic wave propagation;microstrip antennas;microstrip lines;photonic band gap","radiation characteristics;microstrip patch antenna;electromagnetic bandgap surface;mushroom-type EBG structure;half-wavelength resonator;microstrip transmission line;full-wave eigenmode analysis;cavity resonator;microstrip line proximity","","67","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Within this constraint, two aggressive measurement objectives are 1) full characterization and exploitation of the backscattered field, and 2) invariance to geometrical orientations of features in the scene. Full characterization implies coherent dual-polarization to support the four Stokes parameters. These are rotationally invariant with respect backscatterer orientation if and only if the transmission is circularly polarized. Given that the data products are the Stokes parameters, the receivers can use any orthogonal polarization basis. A SAR in hybrid-polarity architecture (CL-pol) transmits circular polarization and receives two orthogonal mutually coherent linear polarizations, which is one manifestation of compact polarimetry. The resulting radar is relatively simple to implement, and has unique self-calibration features and low susceptibility to noise and cross-channel errors. It is the architecture of choice for two lunar radars scheduled for launch in 2008.

The circulating current in the multiple inverter system is analyzed first. A novel control scheme is proposed based on the active and reactive current decomposition concept. In the proposed control, there are two loops: 1) the current sharing control loop and 2) the voltage feedback control loop. For the current sharing loop, the active current and reactive current are controlled separately. It is shown that the minimization of the circulating current can be achieved if both the active current and reactive current of the equivalent load are evenly distributed among activated inverter modules. This control method is superior to the scalar control where only the magnitudes of the currents are controlled. Performance is verified with both simulations and experiments on a prototype HFAC power distribution system where two two-stage resonant inverter modules of 500 kHz and 100 W are connected in parallel through small connection inductors to the 500-kHz 28-V rms HFAC bus.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2007.896143","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4292360","Circulating current minimization;current decomposition;current sharing;high-frequency ac (HFAC) power distribution system;resonant inverter","Power distribution;Resonant inverters;Voltage control;Switches;Power supplies;Electronics industry;Resonance;Power harmonic filters;Power conversion;Feeds","power distribution control;power inductors;resonant invertors","current minimization circulation;high-frequency AC power distribution system;HFAC;multiple inverter modules;high-frequency resonant inverters;high-frequency high-voltage low-current AC bus;HVLC;active current decomposition;reactive current decomposition;current sharing control loop;voltage feedback control loop;frequency 500 kHz;power 100 W;small connection inductors","","71","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore congestion in WSNs needs to be controlled in order to prolong system lifetime. In addition, this is also necessary to improve fairness and provide better quality of service (QoS), which is required by multimedia applications in wireless multimedia sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a novel upstream congestion control protocol for WSNs, called priority-based congestion control protocol (PCCP). Unlike existing work, PCCP innovatively measures congestion degree as the ratio of packet inter-arrival time along over packet service time. PCCP still introduced node priority index to reflect the importance of each sensor node. Based on the introduced congestion degree and node priority index, PCCP utilizes a cross-layer optimization and imposes a hop-by-hop approach to control congestion. We have demonstrated that PCCP achieves efficient congestion control and flexible weighted fairness for both single-path and multi-path routing, as a result this leads to higher energy efficiency and better QoS in terms of both packet loss rate and delay.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2007.070514","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4205060","","Wireless sensor networks;Quality of service;Protocols;Energy consumption;Control systems;Time measurement;Weight control;Routing;Energy efficiency;Delay","energy consumption;multimedia communication;optimisation;packet radio networks;quality of service;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication network routing;wireless sensor networks","upstream congestion control;wireless sensor networks;cross-layer optimization;packet loss;energy consumption;quality of service;wireless multimedia sensor networks;priority-based congestion control protocol;single-path routing;multipath routing","","194","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To give us a better understanding of the nature of the vulnerabilities to supervisory control and data acquisition system (SCADA) systems and highlight the need to defend and protect the SCADA systems from ongoing cyber threats, we investigate the vulnerabilities and ways to protect them which are unique to SCADA systems. We achieve this by studying SCADA communication systems as well as taking a survey of common SCADA vendors; we focus our attention to SCADA on the electric power grid.

In this paper, we propose a complete human recognition system using 3D ear biometrics. The system consists of 3D ear detection, 3D ear identification, and 3D ear verification. For ear detection, we propose a new approach which uses a single reference 3D ear shape model and locates the ear helix and the antihelix parts in registered 2D color and 3D range images. For ear identification and verification using range images, two new representations are proposed. These include the ear helix/antihelix representation obtained from the detection algorithm and the local surface patch (LSP) representation computed at feature points. A local surface descriptor is characterized by a centroid, a local surface type, and a 2D histogram. The 2D histogram shows the frequency of occurrence of shape index values versus the angles between the normal of reference feature point and that of its neighbors. Both shape representations are used to estimate the initial rigid transformation between a gallery-probe pair. This transformation is applied to selected locations of ears in the gallery set and a modified iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm is used to iteratively refine the transformation to bring the gallery ear and probe ear into the best alignment in the sense of the least root mean square error.

To perform reliable sensing, in the basic operation mode on a single frequency band (non-hopping mode), one must allocate quiet times, that is, periodically interrupt data transmission that could impair the QoS of WRAN. This critical issue can be addressed by an alternative operation mode proposed in 802.22 called dynamic frequency hopping (DFH), where WRAN data transmission is performed in parallel with spectrum sensing without interruptions. DFH community, as described in this article, is a mechanism that coordinates multiple WRAN cells operating in the DFH mode, such that efficient frequency usage and reliable channel sensing are achieved.

The k-means clustering method first partitions the training instances into k clusters using Euclidean distance similarity. On each cluster, representing a density region of normal or anomaly instances, we build an ID3 decision tree. The decision tree on each cluster refines the decision boundaries by learning the subgroups within the cluster. To obtain a final decision on classification, the decisions of the k-means and ID3 methods are combined using two rules: 1) the nearest-neighbor rule and 2) the nearest-consensus rule. We perform experiments on three data sets: 1) network anomaly data (NAD), 2) Duffing equation data (DED), and 3) mechanical system data (MSD), which contain measurements from three distinct application domains of computer networks, an electronic circuit implementing a forced Duffing equation, and a mechanical system, respectively.

Both procedures are based on frequency-domain scattering-parameter measurements, and refer to a clamped wiring composed of a single-ended interconnection. One procedure exploits a black-box approach, requires a calibration fixture, and is suited for practical implementation. The other is based on circuit interpretation of coupling and propagation effects, and is aimed at a theoretical analysis of injection. The former procedure requires an accurate deembedding of fixture-related effects, and the latter requires a detailed knowledge of the geometry of the probe interior parts. The two procedures lead to probe circuit models topologically equivalent, with lumped-Pi structure, performing well in the frequency band of interest for BCI. In the derivation, it is shown that the probe input impedance is the central quantity for the characterization of the frequency-dependent properties of the ferrite core, and for the modeling of inductive coupling (dominant effect). The probe circuit models developed in this paper go over the frequency limitations of previous models, and allow for accurate description of the frequency-dependent voltage transfer ratio and series impedance of the probe.","1558-187X","","10.1109/TEMC.2007.902385","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4295213","Bulk current injection (BCI);complex magnetic permeability;conducted susceptibility;ferrites;injection probes","Probes;Integrated circuit modeling;Fixtures;Magnetic permeability;Frequency measurement;Magnetic cores;Calibration","conducting bodies;electronic equipment testing;ferrites;lumped parameter networks;magnetic cores;magnetic susceptibility;probes","series impedance;voltage transfer ratio;inductive coupling;ferrite core;frequency-dependent properties;fixture-related effects;propagation effects;black-box approach;single-ended interconnection;frequency-domain scattering-parameter measurements;lumped-parameter circuit modeling;bulk current injection;injection probes;circuit modeling","","89","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To avoid that the watermarking operation affects the decryption operation, a traditional watermarking algorithm is modified. The encryption and watermarking operations are commutative. Thus, the watermark can be extracted from the encrypted videos, and the encrypted videos can be re-watermarked. This scheme embeds the watermark without exposing video content's confidentiality, and provides a solution for signal processing in encrypted domain. Additionally, it increases the operation efficiency, since the encrypted video can be watermarked without decryption.

A weighted signature generation scheme is developed to integrate ADS with SNORT by extracting signatures from anomalies detected. HIDS extracts signatures from the output of ADS and adds them into the SNORT signature database for fast and accurate intrusion detection. By testing our HIDS scheme over real-life Internet trace data mixed with 10 days of Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Lincoln Laboratory (MIT/LL) attack data set, our experimental results show a 60 percent detection rate of the HIDS, compared with 30 percent and 22 percent in using the SNORT and Bro systems, respectively.

In the MPPT control, the output current of the solar arrays is controlled so that the output power converges on the maximum power in the prediction line previously determined based on the linearity between the maximum output power and the optimization current. The proportionality coefficient of the prediction line is automatically corrected using the hill-climbing method when the panel temperature of the solar arrays is changed.

This paper will focus on two field tests, performed in the Netherlands, applying multi-agent control by means of the PowerMatcher concept. In the PowerMatcher concept (http://www.powermatcher.net/) software agents are used as representatives of the power producing and/or consuming installations. Via market algorithms a strategy is determined to ensure, that their operational schemes are coordinated in order to balance supply and demand according to the business case. The algorithms in the PowerMatcher use a bottom-up electronic market mechanism. Building such a system, controlling primary user processes on one hand, assuring local autonomy, and operating on the electricity market on the other hand, appears to be feasible with mainstream ICT-components.

Thus, the ability to filter spoofed IP packets near victim servers is essential to their own protection and prevention of becoming involuntary DoS reflectors. Although an attacker can forge any field in the IP header, he cannot falsify the number of hops an IP packet takes to reach its destination. More importantly, since the hop-count values are diverse, an attacker cannot randomly spoof IP addresses while maintaining consistent hop-counts. On the other hand, an Internet server can easily infer the hop-count information from the Time-to-Live (TTL) field of the IP header. Using a mapping between IP addresses and their hop-counts, the server can distinguish spoofed IP packets from legitimate ones. Based on this observation, we present a novel filtering technique, called Hop-Count Filtering (HCF)-which builds an accurate IP-to-hop-count (IP2HC) mapping table-to detect and discard spoofed IP packets.

The development and use of accurate methods to predict incipient voltage instability is crucial in preventing such voltage collapse situations. A comparison of the common steady-state methods for voltage stability analysis was undertaken, along with a brief examination into the dynamic approach. Special attention is given to the modal analysis technique presented in [2], which provides both a relative proximity of the system to instability, as well identifies the key contributing factors to instability. A PC-based MATLAB prototype application was developed to assist power system operators in the assessment and analysis of the voltage stability of a power network, at any given operating point, using the modal analysis technique, in addition to useful features such as power flow analysis and traditional V-P/V-Q analysis. Using multiple practical test cases on the IEEE 30 bus system the modal analysis technique was shown to provide an accurate estimate of the system proximity to the voltage stability limit, and to consistently and correctly predict the critical buses and the weakest branches in the transmission system. These results clearly demonstrate the suitability of modal analysis technique as applied to voltage stability analysis, and the need for closer analysis, possible refinement to the method and incorporation into more commercial analysis packages.","2155-5532","978-1-4244-0894-8","10.1109/POWERENG.2007.4380124","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4380124","voltage stability;voltage instability;voltage collapse;steady state voltage stability analysis;modal analysis;Q-V curve","Power system stability;Power system analysis computing;Stability analysis;Modal analysis;Power system dynamics;Low voltage;Steady-state;MATLAB;Prototypes;Load flow analysis","","","","8","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Irrespective of the improvement methodology that is employed this paper assesses two fundamental mechanisms by which better changeovers might be achieved. First, improvement can occur by altering when tasks are conducted. Better allocation of tasks to the resources necessary to conduct them is sought, where the tasks themselves remain essentially unchanged. The second mechanism is to seek structural change to existing tasks, thereby intrinsically enabling them to be completed more quickly.

The proposed method relies on a novel technique to visualize the range information obtained from a 3D laser scanner. This technique converts the visually ambiguous 3D range information into a 2D map where natural features of a scene are highlighted. We show that by enhancing the features the user can easily find the corresponding points of the camera image points. Therefore, visually identifying laser- camera correspondences becomes as easy as image pairing. Once point correspondences are given, extrinsic calibration is done using the well-known PnP algorithm followed by a noninear refinement process. We show the performance of our approach through experimental results. In these experiments, we will use an omnidirectional camera.

By using local energy sources, high reliability can be achieved, and by using dc the number of conversion steps, and therefore also the losses, can be reduced. The dc microgrid can also be used to supply closely located sensitive ac loads during outages on the utility grid. The proposed dc microgrid can be operated in eight different operation modes described here, resulting in 23 transitions. The adaptive control system coordinates the control of converters, sources and switches used in the dc microgrid. The adaptive control system is tested in the simulation software packages PSCAD/EMTDC, and the results of the most interesting operation modes and transitions are presented. The results show that it is possible to use the proposed dc microgrid to supply sensitive electronic loads, and also during utility grid outages, supply closely located sensitive ac loads.

This paper presents a new method for recognition of whole-body key gestures in HRI. A human subject is first described by a set of features, encoding the angular relationship between a dozen body parts in 3-D. A feature vector is then mapped to a codeword of hidden Markov models. In order to spot key gestures accurately, a sophisticated method of designing a transition gesture model is proposed. To reduce the states of the transition gesture model, model reduction which merges similar states based on data-dependent statistics and relative entropy is used. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can be efficient and effective in HRI, for automatic recognition of whole-body key gestures from motion sequences","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2006.889491","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4154835","Gesture spotting;hidden Markov model (HMM);human–robot interaction (HRI);mobile robot;transition gesture model;whole-body gesture recognition","Service robots;Hidden Markov models;Humans;Biological system modeling;Robotics and automation;Manufacturing industries;Motion analysis;Intelligent robots;Computer science;Handicapped aids","gesture recognition;hidden Markov models;man-machine systems;robot vision;vectors","gesture spotting;whole-body key gesture recognition;human-robot interaction;3D feature encoding;feature vector mapping;hidden Markov models;transition gesture models;model reduction;motion sequences","","82","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our goal is to classify the event in the image as well as to provide a number of semantic labels to the objects and scene environment within the image. For example, given a rowing scene, our algorithm recognizes the event as rowing by classifying the environment as a lake and recognizing the critical objects in the image as athletes, rowing boat, water, etc. We achieve this integrative and holistic recognition through a generative graphical model. We have assembled a highly challenging database of 8 widely varied sport events. We show that our system is capable of classifying these event classes at 73.4% accuracy.

Often, the behavior is defined as the set of solutions of a system of differential equations. Models that specify a behavior usually involve latent variables in addition to the manifest variables the model aims at. We have also described a methodology for modeling interconnected systems, called tearing, zooming, and linking. The underlying mathematical language consists of terminals, modules, the interconnection graph, the module embedding, and the manifest variable assignment. The combination of module equations, interconnection constraints, and manifest variable assignment leads to a latent-variable representation for the behavior of the manifest variables the model aims. This methodology of tearing, zooming, and linking offers a systematic procedure for modeling interconnected systems that is much better adapted to the physics of interconnected systems than input/output-modeling procedures such as, for example, Simulink. The methodology of tearing, zooming, and linking has many things in common with bond graphs.","1941-000X","","10.1109/MCS.2007.906923","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4384643","","Interconnected systems;Joining processes;Hydraulic systems;Signal processing;Switches;Visualization;Physics;Feedback control;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems","differential equations;graph theory;interconnected systems","behavioral approach;open system;interconnected system;mathematical description;dynamical system;time trajectory;differential equation;interconnection graph;module embedding;manifest variable assignment;latent-variable representation;input-output-modeling procedure","","190","","74","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The reflectivity of smooth, optically thick materials can be modeled with Fresnel equations. In case of materials with a rough surface, diffuse scattering reduces the power reflected in the specular direction. Kirchhoff scattering theory can be employed to derive modified Fresnel equations which account for these losses by introducing a Rayleigh roughness factor calculated from the measured surface height distribution of the sample under observation. Using the resulting, analytically derived reflection coefficient based on material parameter and surface measurements in propagation models enables the simulation of arbitrary configurations. We present a set of calculated and measured reflection coefficients for a selection of common indoor building materials which are in good agreement, thus verifying our modeling approach. Furthermore, we illustrate by ray-tracing simulations the effect of wall and ceiling roughness on propagation in future indoor scenarios. Both, absolute power levels and propagation patterns are shown to be strongly influenced by scattering. In some cases, reflected transmissions with longer propagation paths can be more efficient than the shorter ones in terms of incurred losses.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2007.908559","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4380579","Kirchhoff approximation;ray-tracing;rough surface scattering;THz channel modeling;THz communication","Optical scattering;Rayleigh scattering;Power system modeling;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Communication systems;Building materials;Optical materials;Equations;Optical reflection","building materials;ceilings;electromagnetic wave reflection;electromagnetic wave scattering;indoor radio;picocellular radio;reflectivity;rough surfaces;submillimetre wave propagation;walls;wireless channels","THz communication systems;propagation channels;cellular indoor communication;indoor building materials;reflection coefficient;optically thick materials;Fresnel equations;smooth surface;rough surface;diffuse scattering;Kirchhoff scattering theory;modified Fresnel equations;Rayleigh roughness factor;surface height distribution;ray-tracing simulations;wall roughness;ceiling roughness","","135","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Univ.; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","","2007","16","11","2830","2841","This paper proposes a new algorithm to integrate image registration into image super-resolution (SR). Image SR is a process to reconstruct a high-resolution (HR) image by fusing multiple low-resolution (LR) images. A critical step in image SR is accurate registration of the LR images or, in other words, effective estimation of motion parameters. Conventional SR algorithms assume either the estimated motion parameters by existing registration methods to be error-free or the motion parameters are known a priori. This assumption, however, is impractical in many applications, as most existing registration algorithms still experience various degrees of errors, and the motion parameters among the LR images are generally unknown a priori. In view of this, this paper presents a new framework that performs simultaneous image registration and HR image reconstruction. As opposed to other current methods that treat image registration and HR reconstruction as disjoint processes, the new framework enables image registration and HR reconstruction to be estimated simultaneously and improved progressively. Further, unlike most algorithms that focus on the translational motion model, the proposed method adopts a more generic motion model that includes both translation as well as rotation. An iterative scheme is developed to solve the arising nonlinear least squares problem. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective in performing image registration and SR for simulated as well as real-life images.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2007.908074","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4337760","Image super-resolution (SR);image registration;nonlinear least squares methods","Least squares methods;Image registration;Image resolution;Strontium;Image reconstruction;Motion estimation;Parameter estimation;Sensor arrays;Iterative algorithms","image reconstruction;image registration;image resolution;iterative methods;least squares approximations;motion estimation","nonlinear least square technique;image registration;image super-resolution;high-resolution image;motion parameters estimation;a priori;image reconstruction;disjoint processes;translational motion model;iterative scheme","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Least-Squares Analysis;Models, Statistical;Nonlinear Dynamics;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","70","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents a unified view of several recently proposed algorithms for handling this class of optimization problems, placing them in a common majorization-minimization (MM) framework. One of the classes of algorithms considered (when using quadratic bounds on nondifferentiable log-priors) shares the infamous ¿singularity issue¿ (SI) of ¿iteratively re weighted least squares¿ (IRLS) algorithms: the possibility of having to handle infinite weights, which may cause both numerical and convergence issues. In this paper, we prove several new results which strongly support the claim that the SI does not compromise the usefulness of this class of algorithms. Exploiting the unified MM perspective, we introduce a new algorithm, resulting from using bounds for nonconvex regularizers; the experiments confirm the superior performance of this method, when compared to the one based on quadratic majorization. Finally, an experimental comparison of the several algorithms, reveals their relative merits for different standard types of scenarios.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2007.909318","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4358845","Image deconvolution;image restoration;majorization–minimization (MM) algorithms;optimization;regularization;wavelets;Image deconvolution;image restoration;majorization-minimization (MM) algorithms;optimization;regularization;wavelets","Image restoration;Noise reduction;Iterative algorithms;Deconvolution;Optimization methods;Convolution;Convergence of numerical methods;Image denoising;Computational efficiency;Telecommunications","image restoration;least squares approximations;minimisation;wavelet transforms","majorization-minimization algorithm;wavelet-based image restoration;singularity issue algorithm;iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm","Algorithms;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","289","","53","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike traditional rigid-link robot manipulators, continuum robot manipulators do not have rigid joints, hence these manipulators are extremely dexterous, compliant, and are capable of dynamic adaptive manipulation in unstructured environments. However, the development of high-performance control algorithms for these manipulators is quite a challenge, due to their unique design and the high degree of uncertainty in their dynamic models. In this paper, a controller for continuum robots, which utilizes a neural network feedforward component to compensate for dynamic uncertainties is presented. Experimental results using the OCTARM, which is a soft extensible continuum manipulator, are provided to illustrate that the addition of the neural network feedforward component to the controller provides improved performance.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2007.906248","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359261","Continuum robot;feedforward control;neural network;robot control;Continuum robot;feedforward control;neural network;robot control","Neural networks;Robot control;Manipulator dynamics;Sliding mode control;Shape control;Feedforward neural networks;Vehicle dynamics;Target tracking;Uncertainty;Kinematics","dexterous manipulators;feedforward neural nets;neurocontrollers;redundant manipulators","neural network controller;continuum robots;hyper-redundant robot manipulators;continuum robot manipulators;dynamic adaptive manipulation;high-performance control algorithms;OCTARM;soft extensible continuum manipulator;neural network feedforward component","","76","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Bandwidth Enhancement of Miniaturized Slot Antennas Using Folded, Complementary, and Self-Complementary Realizations","R. Azadegan; K. Sarabandi","Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor; NA","IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","","2007","55","9","2435","2444","Folded and self-complementary structures are considered as two effective approaches to increase the bandwidth of miniaturized antennas. A folded realization of a previously reported miniaturized slot antenna is devised and shown to provide more than 100% increase in the bandwidth as compared with that of the miniaturized slot antenna with the same size and efficiency. The complementary pair of the miniaturized folded slot, namely, the folded printed wire is also discussed in this paper. It is shown that the folded slot has a much higher radiation efficiency when compared with its complementary folded wire antenna. Another approach for bandwidth improvement is the implementation of the self-complementary structure of the same miniaturized topology to moderate the frequency dependence of the antenna input impedance. To examine this approach, a folded self-complementary miniature antenna is studied, where further increase in bandwidth is observed. A miniaturized folded slot, its complementary miniaturized folded printed wire, as well as their self-complementary realization, were fabricated and tested. These antennas can fit into a very small rectangular area with dimensions as small as 0.065lambdao x 0.065lambdao. While the folded slot ranks the highest in the efficiency/gain, the self-complementary structure falls between the slot and printed wire since it consists of equal proportions of the both slots and strips. A self-complementary H-shape antenna is also introduced to demonstrate that by relaxing the miniaturization to a moderate value, a significant improvement in bandwidth can be accomplished. With yet small dimensions of 0.13lambdao x 0.24lambdao, a very wide bandwidth of (2.3:1) is obtained. For the case of no dielectric substrate, even wider bandwidth of (3:1) is achievable.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2007.904086","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4298165","Folded dipole;folded slot;miniaturized antenna;self-complementary antenna;slot antenna","Bandwidth;Slot antennas;Wire;Dipole antennas;Topology;Impedance;Laboratories;Antenna accessories;Resonance;Antennas and propagation","dipole antennas;slot antennas","self complementary structures;folded printed wire;frequency dependence;antenna input impedance;H shape antenna;folded dipole;folded structures;miniaturized slot antennas;bandwidth enhancement","","25","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike a conventional passive-elastic ankle-foot prosthesis, this prosthesis can provide active mechanical power during the stance period of walking. The basic architecture of the prosthesis is a unidirectional spring, configured in parallel with a force-controllable actuator with series elasticity. With this architecture, the ankle-foot prosthesis matches the size and weight of the human ankle, and is also capable of delivering high mechanical power and torque observed in normal human walking. We also propose a biomimetic control scheme that allows the prosthesis to mimic the normal human ankle behavior during walking. To evaluate the performance of the prosthesis, we measured the rate of oxygen consumption of three unilateral transtibial amputees walking at self-selected speeds to estimate the metabolic walking economy. We find that the powered prosthesis improves amputee metabolic economy from 7% to 20% compared to the conventional passive-elastic prostheses (Flex-Foot Ceterus and Freedom Innovations Sierra), even though the powered system is twofold heavier than the conventional devices. This result highlights the benefit of performing net positive work at the ankle joint to amputee ambulation and also suggests a new direction for further advancement of an ankle-foot prosthesis.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-0787-3","10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4352965","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4352965","","Prosthetics;Legged locomotion;Humans;Springs;Actuators;Elasticity;Torque;Biomimetics;Velocity measurement;Technological innovation","actuators;biomechanics;biomimetics;elasticity;medical control systems;patient rehabilitation;prosthetics","powered ankle-foot prosthesis;amputee ambulation;mechanical design;clinical evaluation;motorized ankle-foot prosthesis;unidirectional spring;force-controllable actuator;series elasticity;mechanical power;biomimetic control scheme;oxygen consumption;metabolic walking economy","Adult;Amputees;Ankle;Computer-Aided Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Foot;Humans;Knee Prosthesis;Male;Middle Aged;Orthotic Devices;Prosthesis Design","72","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Wavelet analysis is used to decompose the EEG into delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma sub-bands. Three parameters are employed for EEG representation: standard deviation (quantifying the signal variance), correlation dimension, and largest Lyapunov exponent (quantifying the non-linear chaotic dynamics of the signal). The classification accuracies of the following techniques are compared: 1) unsupervised-means clustering; 2) linear and quadratic discriminant analysis; 3) radial basis function neural network; 4) Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation neural network (LMBPNN). To reduce the computing time and output analysis, the research was performed in two phases: band-specific analysis and mixed-band analysis. In phase two, over 500 different combinations of mixed-band feature spaces consisting of promising parameters from phase one of the research were investigated. It is concluded that all three key components of the wavelet-chaos-neural network methodology are important for improving the EEG classification accuracy. Judicious combinations of parameters and classifiers are needed to accurately discriminate between the three types of EEGs. It was discovered that a particular mixed-band feature space consisting of nine parameters and LMBPNN result in the highest classification accuracy, a high value of 96.7%.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2007.891945","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4291661","Chaos;EEG sub-bands;epilepsy;neural network classification;wavelet","Epilepsy;Electroencephalography;Performance analysis;Neurons;Biomedical engineering;Signal analysis;Wavelet analysis;Chaos;Radial basis function networks;Backpropagation","biomedical engineering;electroencephalography;Lyapunov methods;medical signal processing;patient diagnosis;patient monitoring;radial basis function networks","mixed band wavelet chaos neural network methodology;epilepsy;epileptic seizure detection;electroencephalograms;EEG;wavelet analysis;standard deviation;correlation dimension;Lyapunov exponent;unsupervised means clustering;linear discriminant analysis;quadratic discriminant analysis;radial basis function neural network;Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation neural network LMBPNN;computing time;output analysis;band specific analysis;mixed band analysis","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Discriminant Analysis;Epilepsy;Humans;Neural Networks (Computer);Nonlinear Dynamics;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","298","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, it is not necessary to compensate the dead time effect and the possibility of arm short is strongly eliminated. The current control of PWM power converters can easily adopt the proposed switching strategy by using the polarity information of the reference current instead of the real current, thus eliminating the problems that commonly arise from real current detection. In order to confirm the usefulness of the proposed switching strategy, experimental tests were done using a single-phase inverter with passive loads, a three-phase inverter for induction motor drives, a three-phase ac/dc PWM converter, a three-phase active power filter, and a class-D amplifier, the results of which are presented in this paper","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2006.888793","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4084648","Dead time effect;power converters;pulse width modulation;switching strategy","Pulse width modulation converters;Pulse width modulation;Switching converters;Pulse width modulation inverters;Active filters;Pulse amplifiers;AC motors;Switching circuits;Voltage;Minimization methods","AC-DC power convertors;active filters;power amplifiers;power filters;PWM invertors;PWM power convertors;switching convertors","switching strategy;pulse width modulation power converters;PWM;on-off switching action;current polarity;dead time effect;current control;single-phase inverter;passive loads;three-phase inverter;induction motor drives;three-phase AC-DC PWM converter;three-phase active power filter;class-D amplifier","","73","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Univ. of Singapore; NA","IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","","2007","4","2","265","273","In this paper, we develop a framework to classify supply chain risk-management problems and approaches for the solution of these problems. We argue that risk-management problems need to be handled at three levels: 1) strategic, 2) operational, and 3) tactical. In addition, risk within the supply chain might manifest itself in the form of deviations, disruptions, and disasters. To handle unforeseen events in the supply chain, there are two obvious approaches: 1) to design chains with built-in risk tolerance and 2) to contain the damage once the undesirable event has occurred. Both of these approaches require a clear understanding of undesirable events that may take place in the supply chain and the associated consequences and impacts from these events. Having described these approaches, we then focus our efforts on mapping out the propagation of events in the supply chain due to supplier nonperformance, and employ our insight to develop two mathematical programming-based preventive models for strategic level deviation and disruption management. The first model, a simple integer quadratic optimization model, adapted from the Markowitz model, determines optimal partner selection with the objective of minimizing both the operational cost and the variability of total operational cost. The second model, a simple mixed integer programming optimization model, adapted from the credit risk minimization model, determines optimal partner selection such that the supply shortfall is minimized even in the face of supplier disruptions.

"Fading Channel Prediction for Mobile Radio Adaptive Transmission Systems","A. Duel-Hallen","North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh","Proceedings of the IEEE","","2007","95","12","2299","2313","Adaptive transmission methods can potentially aid the achievement of high data rates required for mobile radio multimedia services. To realize this potential, the transmitter needs accurate channel state information (CSI) for the upcoming transmission frame. In most mobile radio systems, the CSI is estimated at the receiver and fed back to the transmitter. However, unless the mobile speed is very low, the estimated CSI cannot be used directly to select the parameters of adaptive transmission systems, since it quickly becomes outdated due to the rapid channel variation caused by multipath fading. To enable adaptive transmission for mobile radio systems, prediction of future fading channel samples is required. Several fundamental issues arise in the design and testing of fading prediction algorithms for adaptive transmission systems. These include complexity, robustness, choice of an appropriate channel model for algorithm validation, channel estimation and noise reduction required for reliable prediction, and design and analysis of adaptive transmission methods aided by fading prediction algorithms. We use these criteria in the review of recent advances in the area of fading channel prediction. We also demonstrate that reliable fading prediction makes adaptive transmission feasible in diverse wireless communication systems.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2007.904443","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4389753","Adaptive modulation (AM);adaptive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems;adaptive orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM);adaptive spread spectrum systems;adaptive transmission;fading channel prediction","Fading;Land mobile radio;Adaptive systems;Algorithm design and analysis;Radio transmitters;Prediction algorithms;Channel state information;Receivers;System testing;Noise robustness","channel estimation;fading channels;mobile radio;multimedia systems;multipath channels;radio transmitters","fading channel prediction;mobile radio multimedia services;adaptive transmission system;channel state information;CSI;multipath fading;channel estimation;noise reduction;diverse wireless communication system","","156","","72","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Seven research groups worldwide participated in the contest, testing eight algorithms following different philosophies [component substitution, multiresolution analysis (MRA), detail injection, etc.]. Several complete data sets from two different sensors, namely, QuickBird and simulated Pleiades, were delivered to all participants. The fusion results were collected and evaluated, both visually and objectively. Quantitative results of pansharpening were possible owing to the availability of reference originals obtained either by simulating the data collected from the satellite sensor by means of higher resolution data from an airborne platform, in the case of the Pleiades data, or by first degrading all the available data to a coarser resolution and saving the original as the reference, in the case of the QuickBird data.

Hence, the need for energy efficient infrastructure is becoming increasingly more important since it impacts upon the network operational lifetime. Sensor node clustering is one of the techniques that can expand the lifespan of the whole network through data aggregation at the cluster head. In this paper, we present an energy-aware clustering for wireless sensor networks using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm which is implemented at the base station. We define a new cost function, with the objective of simultaneously minimizing the intra-cluster distance and optimizing the energy consumption of the network. The performance of our protocol is compared with the well known cluster-based protocol developed for WSNs, LEACH (low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy) and LEACH-C, the later being an improved version of LEACH. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed protocol can achieve better network lifetime and data delivery at the base station over its comparatives.","2166-9589","978-1-4244-1143-6","10.1109/PIMRC.2007.4394521","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4394521","","Wireless sensor networks;Particle swarm optimization;Base stations;Protocols;Energy consumption;Clustering algorithms;Energy efficiency;Land mobile radio;Mobile communication;Computer networks","particle swarm optimisation;protocols;wireless sensor networks","energy-aware clustering;wireless sensor networks;particle swarm optimization;nonreplenishable energy supply;energy efficient infrastructure;network operational lifetime;sensor node clustering;data aggregation;cost function;intra-cluster distance;energy consumption;cluster-based protocol;WSN;LEACH;low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy;LEACH-C;data delivery","","120","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A major advantage of using PK-based protocols is that they do not require the private key stored in the FPGA to leave the device, thus increasing security.

The weights are obtained as regression coefficients between the MS bands and the spatially degraded panchromatic (Pan) image, with the aim of capturing the spectral responses of the sensors. Once it has been integrated into the Gram-Schmidt spectral-sharpening method, which is implemented in environment for visualizing images (ENVI) program, and into the generalized intensity-hue-saturation fusion method, the proposed preprocessing module allows the production of fused images of the same spatial sharpness but of increased spectral quality with respect to the standard implementations.

High density wireless networks, by design, face significant challenges due to increased interference resulting from the close proximity of co-channel cells. We demonstrate that power control can be used to mitigate interference in such an environment. It is well-known that variable transmit powers result in asymmetric links in the network, and can potentially lead to throughput starvation of some nodes. We first show that in order to perform starvation-free power control in 802.11 networks, a cross-layer approach is required, whereby the transmit powers and the carrier sensing parameter of the MAC layer of the nodes should be jointly tuned. We then propose a framework that determines optimum settings for these parameters with the objective of maximizing the network-wide throughput for elastic traffic. Within this framework, we devise a distributed power control algorithm that uses a Gibbs sampler. OPNET simulations and experiments over a proof of concept testbed demonstrate that in a dense network the proposed power control algorithm yields significant improvement in client throughput.","0743-166X","1-4244-1047-9","10.1109/INFCOM.2007.69","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4215651","","Interference;Power control;Throughput;Costs;Bandwidth;Urban areas;Wireless networks;Communication system traffic control;Traffic control;Testing","interference suppression;sampling methods;telecommunication control;telecommunication traffic;wireless channels;wireless LAN","802.11 wireless LAN;interference mitigation;WiFi device;co-channel cell;cross-layer approach;MAC layer;medium access control;distributed power control algorithm;Gibbs sampler;OPNET simulation;elastic traffic","","132","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The observed symbols are first modeled as channel responses in a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) model, while the channel inputs are conceptually considered sparse positive pulse trains carrying the information about the symbol arising times. Our decomposition approach compensates channel responses and aims at reconstructing the input pulse trains directly. The algorithm is derived first for the overdetermined noiseless MIMO case. A generalized scheme is then provided for the underdetermined mixtures in noisy environments.

Conventional DFT-based channel estimations improve the performance by suppressing time domain noise. However, they potentially require information on channel impulse responses and may also result in mean-square error (MSE) floor due to incorrect channel information such as channel delay spread. In contrast, our purposed channel estimation can improve the performance by deciding significant channel taps adaptively without requiring any channel statistical information. Significant channel taps are detected on the basis of a predetermined threshold. The optimal threshold to reduce the MSE of the estimation is also derived, and it is confirmed by computer simulation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can improve the MSE performance ~6.5 dB compared with the conventional DFT-based estimation, and the MSE floor is not observed in any channels.","1751-8636","","10.1049/iet-com:20050337","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4167659","","","channel estimation;discrete Fourier transforms;mean square error methods;multipath channels;OFDM modulation;transient response","DFT-based channel estimation;discrete Fourier transform;OFDM system;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system;channel impulse response;mean-square error","","67","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals"

The adaptive critic NN controller architecture based on state feedback includes two NNs: the critic NN is used to approximate the ""strategic"" utility function, whereas the action NN is employed to minimize both the strategic utility function and the unknown nonlinear dynamic estimation errors. The critic and action NN weight updates are derived by minimizing certain quadratic performance indexes. Using the Lyapunov approach and with novel weight updates, the uniformly ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop tracking error and weight estimates is shown in the presence of NN approximation errors and bounded unknown disturbances. The proposed NN controller works in the presence of multiple nonlinearities, unlike other schemes that normally approximate one nonlinearity.

Our method relies on the accurate segmentation of the vasculature of the retina followed by the determination of spatial features describing the density, average thickness, and average orientation of the vasculature in relation to the position of the optic nerve. Localization of the macula follows using knowledge of the optic nerve location to detect the horizontal raphe of the retina using a geometric model of the vasculature. We report 90.4% detection performance for the optic nerve and 92.5% localization performance for the macula for red-free fundus images representing a population of 345 images corresponding to 269 patients with 18 different pathologies associated with DR and other common retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2007.902801","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359034","Bayesian classifier;diabetic retinopathy;feature analysis;macula localization;optic nerve detection;red-free fundus imagery;vascular segmentation;diabetic retinopathy;red-free fundus imagery;vascular segmentation;optic nerve detection;macula localization;feature analysis;Bayesian classifier","Humans;Retina;Biomedical optical imaging;Geometrical optics;Image analysis;Availability;Optical imaging;Biomedical imaging;Medical diagnostic imaging;Image processing","biomedical optical imaging;diseases;eye;feature extraction;image segmentation;medical image processing;photography","automatic detection;anatomic structures;human retinal imagery;IEEE electronic imaging devices;image processing;retinal disease diagnosis;diabetic retinopathy;computer-based screening;automated image analysis;optic nerve;macula localization;digital fundus photography;red-free fundus photography;vasculature segmentation;retina","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Fluorescein Angiography;Fundus Oculi;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Macula Lutea;Macula Lutea;Optic Nerve;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photography;Retina;Retinal Diseases;Retinal Diseases;Retinal Vessels;Sensitivity and Specificity","142","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Tannenbaum","Univ. of Waterloo, Waterloo; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","","2007","16","11","2787","2801","This paper addresses the problem of image segmentation by means of active contours, whose evolution is driven by the gradient flow derived from an energy functional that is based on the Bhattacharyya distance. In particular, given the values of a photometric variable (or of a set thereof), which is to be used for classifying the image pixels, the active contours are designed to converge to the shape that results in maximal discrepancy between the empirical distributions of the photometric variable inside and outside of the contours. The above discrepancy is measured by means of the Bhattacharyya distance that proves to be an extremely useful tool for solving the problem at hand. The proposed methodology can be viewed as a generalization of the segmentation methods, in which active contours maximize the difference between a finite number of empirical moments of the ldquoinsiderdquo and ldquooutsiderdquo distributions. Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed methodology is very versatile and flexible in the sense that it allows one to easily accommodate a diversity of the image features based on which the segmentation should be performed. As an additional contribution, a method for automatically adjusting the smoothness properties of the empirical distributions is proposed. Such a procedure is crucial in situations when the number of data samples (supporting a certain segmentation class) varies considerably in the course of the evolution of the active contour. In this case, the smoothness properties of the empirical distributions have to be properly adjusted to avoid either over- or underestimation artifacts. Finally, a number of relevant segmentation results are demonstrated and some further research directions are discussed.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2007.908073","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4337766","Active contours;Bhattacharyya distance;image segmentation;kernel density estimation","Image segmentation;Active contours;Biomedical imaging;Biomedical computing;Photometry;Pixel;Image converters;Shape;Kernel;Hospitals","gradient methods;image classification;image resolution;image segmentation","active contours;photometric variable;image pixel classification;Bhattacharyya gradient flow;image segmentation","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","214","","59","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the proposed MPEA scheme, the MPED mechanism, operating like a traditional hill-climbing method, drives the output power gradually increasing to its maximum value by regulating the direction of current command according to the power variation trend. The MPDS control produces an additional step of current command based on the instantaneous difference of generator speeds, so that it can prevent the wind turbine from stalling at the suddenly dropping wind speed and achieve the object of maximum power extraction instantly as a stiff wind flowing through the wind turbine.

Due to sophisticated tool specifications and process flows in semiconductor manufacturing, queueing models can be very complicated. Research efforts have been on the improvement of model assumptions and model input, mainly in the first moment (averages) and the second moment (variations). However, practices show that implementation of classical queueing theory in semiconductor industry has been unsatisfactory. In this paper, open problems on queueing modeling of SMS are discussed. A potential solution is also proposed by relaxing the independent assumptions in the classical queueing theory. Cycle time reduction has constantly been a key focus of semiconductor manufacturing. Compared with simulation, queueing theory-based analytical modeling is much faster in estimating manufacturing system performance and providing more insights for performance improvement. Therefore, queueing modeling attracts generous semiconductor research grants. Unfortunately, existing queueing models focus on simple extensions of the classical queueing theory and fail to question its applicability to the complicated SMS. Hence, related researches have not been employed widely in the semiconductor industry. In this paper, we conduct a survey on the important works and also present some open problems. We also propose a novel solution by relaxing a key assumption in the classical queueing theory. We are currently funded by Intel to explore this potential solution, and we hope it can foster an interesting research field for the years to come.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2007.906348","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4312834","Cycle time;manufacturing systems;queueing theory;semiconductor manufacturing","Queueing analysis;Manufacturing systems;Semiconductor device manufacture;Analytical models;Job shop scheduling;Industrial engineering;Electronics industry;Performance analysis;Automation;Stochastic processes","integrated circuit manufacture;queueing theory;scheduling","semiconductor manufacturing systems;open problem;cycle time reduction;queueing theory-based analytical modeling","","90","","66","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The idea behind the active speed stall control concept is to make a rotor that is as simple as possible, and therefore very robust and suitable for offshore wind turbines. This is done by removing the pitch control of the blades. Above rated wind speed, the power is not controlled by controlling the pitch, but by controlling the rotor speed: the rotor speed is so much reduced that the aerodynamic power is limited to the rated value. A rough 10 MW permanent-magnet direct- drive generator design is presented, indicating that such a generator is feasible. It is shown that for a thorough evaluation of active speed stall control, more knowledge is required about changes in the wind speed. However, a considerable increase in generator system cost is necessary to enable active speed stall control.","","1-4244-0742-7","10.1109/IEMDC.2007.383632","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4270852","wind turbine;synchronous generator;permanent-magnet generator;direct-drive","Wind turbines;Wind energy generation;Control systems;Wind speed;Power generation;Rotors;Blades;Aerodynamics;Robustness;Permanent magnet motors","permanent magnet generators;rotors;turbogenerators;velocity control;wind turbines","wind turbine direct-drive generator;active speed stall control;pitch control;rotor speed;permanent magnet generators;power 10 MW","","60","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The electrical field strength and voltages evaluated using either the single-cavity resonator (eigen mode) model or simply the prototype model have been presented and compared against the direct EM computation of the complete filter structure. Close agreement has been found between the full EM modeling and the scaling of a single resonator or even prototype network analysis only. This procedure is expected to simplify the multipaction and ionization breakdown analysis of filters and filter-based diplexers and multiplexers. The method presented is general and is applicable to all filter types that can be described in a circuit model. Practical issues such as the multicarrier operation, sharp edge condition, design margin, and prevention techniques are also covered.","1557-9581","","10.1109/MMM.2007.904712","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4383439","","Radio frequency;Electric breakdown;Microwave filters;Electrons;Radio transmitters;Ionization;Vacuum breakdown;Breakdown voltage;Plasma temperature;Performance analysis","cavity resonators;computational electromagnetics;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;electric field measurement;multiplexing equipment;radiofrequency filters","power-handling capability;RF filters;cross-coupled prototype network theory;EM modeling techniques;breakdown threshold analysis;electrical field strength;single-cavity resonator;eigenmode model;prototype network analysis;multipaction breakdown analysis;ionization breakdown analysis;filter-based diplexers;filter-based multiplexers","","69","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The keys to its performance are effective techniques for enforcing local photometric consistency and global visibility constraints.

While single radio mesh nodes operating on a single channel suffer from capacity constraints, equipping mesh routers with multiple radios using multiple nonoverlap- ping channels can significantly alleviate the capacity problem and increase the aggregate bandwidth available to the network. However, the assignment of channels to the radio interfaces poses significant challenges. The goal of channel assignment algorithms in multiradio mesh networks is to minimize interference while improving the aggregate network capacity and maintaining the connectivity of the network. In this article we examine the unique constraints of channel assignment in wireless mesh networks and identify the key factors governing assignment schemes, with particular reference to interference, traffic patterns, and multipath connectivity.

Proper modulation of the new inverter would therefore require careful integration of the selective shoot-through process to the basic switching concepts to achieve maximal voltage-boost, minimal harmonic distortion, lower semiconductor stress, and minimal number of device commutations per switching cycle. To date, the theoretical background on Z-source NPC modulation has not been fully established, and it is the theme of this paper to propose a number of enhanced voltage-boost pulsewidth modulation (PWM) strategies for controlling the Z-source NPC inverter.

However, theory and methods for exploiting the potential of reconfigurable RF front-ends are not fully developed. In this paper, we study the impact of reconfigurable antenna arrays on maximizing the capacity of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) wireless communication links in sparse multipath environments. There is growing experimental evidence that physical wireless channels exhibit a sparse multipath structure, even at relatively low antenna dimensions. We propose a model for sparse multipath channels and show that sparse channels afford a new dimension over which capacity can be optimized: the distribution or configuration of the sparse statistically independent degrees of freedom (DoF) in the available spatial signal space dimensions. Our results show that the configuration of the sparse DoF has a profound impact on capacity and also characterize the optimal capacity-maximizing channel configuration at any operating SNR. We then develop a framework for realizing the optimal channel configuration at any SNR by systematically adapting the antenna spacings at the transmitter and the receiver to the level of sparsity in the physical multipath environment. Surprisingly, three canonical array configurations are sufficient for near-optimum performance over the entire SNR range. In a sparse scattering environment with randomly distributed paths, the capacity gain due to the optimal configuration is directly proportional to the number of antennas.

The proposed system can be considered as a fundamentally improved version of the conventional three-phase Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) system which is widely used in power system applications.

Prior research literature, while not exclusively focusing on CMM level 5 projects, has identified a host of factors as determinants of software development effort, quality, and cycle time. In this study, we focus exclusively on CMM level 5 projects from multiple organizations to study the impacts of highly mature processes on effort, quality, and cycle time. Using a linear regression model based on data collected from 37 CMM level 5 projects of four organizations, we find that high levels of process maturity, as indicated by CMM level 5 rating, reduce the effects of most factors that were previously believed to impact software development effort, quality, and cycle time. The only factor found to be significant in determining effort, cycle time, and quality was software size. On the average, the developed models predicted effort and cycle time around 12 percent and defects to about 49 percent of the actuals, across organizations. Overall, the results in this paper indicate that some of the biggest rewards from high levels of process maturity come from the reduction in variance of software development outcomes that were caused by factors other than software size","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2007.29","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4084133","Cost estimation;time estimation;software quality;productivity.","Software quality;Coordinate measuring machines;Programming;Costs;Capability maturity model;Object oriented modeling;Productivity;Best practices;ISO standards;Six sigma","Capability Maturity Model;regression analysis;software cost estimation;software development management;software quality","software development effort;software quality;software cycle time estimation;CMM level 5 project;Capability Maturity Model;software development process improvement;organization productivity;linear regression model;software cost estimation","","103","","57","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The kernel of this transform, i.e., the range-frequency-dependent azimuth time rescaling, is implemented using only complex multiplications and fast Fourier transforms based on the scaling principle, which has been successfully applied in the equalization of the space-variant range cell migration in SAR processing. In addition, the moving target is coarsely focused according to the SAR geometry and the platform velocity while exploiting the scaling principle. This preliminary focusing is helpful in the isolation of the moving target from ground clutter, so as to facilitate a more refined processing with respect to each mover.

The backward sweep is used to build the relationship between branch currents and bus current injections of a distribution system, and then the forward sweep can use the aforementioned relationship to calculate bus voltages. The forward/backward sweep technique is a powerful method and has been widely used in distribution system analysis; however, it cannot be used for harmonic analysis directly. Therefore, the proposed method designs some specific data formats, integrates them into the commonly used forward/backward sweep technique, and derives useful formulas to calculate the effects of system status induced by harmonic pollution. The proposed method is more efficient than the conventional harmonic analysis algorithms since the time-consuming procedure of the admittance matrix inverse is not necessary in the solution procedure.

Compared with existing H.264 rate control schemes, our scheme has offered several new features. First, the inter-dependency between rate-distortion optimization (RDO) and rate control in H.264 is resolved via quantization parameter estimation and update. Second, since the bits of the header information may occupy a larger portion of the total bit budget, which is especially true when being coded at low bit rates, a rate model for the header information is developed to estimate header bits more accurately. The number of header bits is modeled as a function of the number of nonzero motion vector (MV) elements and the number of MVs. Third, a new source rate model and a distortion model are proposed. For this purpose, coded 4 times 4 blocks are identified and the number of source bits and distortion are modeled as functions of the quantization stepsize and the complexity of coded 4 times 4 blocks. Finally, a R-D optimized bit allocation scheme among macroblocks (MBs) is proposed to improve picture quality. Built upon the above ideas, a rate control algorithm is developed for the H.264 baseline-profile encoder under the constant bit rate constraint. It is shown by experimental results that the new algorithm can control bit rates accurately with the R-D performance significantly better than that of the rate control algorithm implemented in the H.264 software encoder JM8.1a","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2007.894053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4162551","H.264;optimal bit allocation;rate control;rate-distortion (R-D) optimization","Rate distortion theory;Quadratic programming;Bit rate;Quantization;Rate-distortion;Software algorithms;Video coding;Encoding;Parameter estimation;Software performance","computational complexity;data compression;image motion analysis;video coding","rate control scheme;distortion models;H.264 video encoding;rate-distortion optimization;quantization parameter estimation;nonzero motion vector;source rate model;quantization stepsize;optimized bit allocation scheme;picture quality;H.264 baseline-profile encoder;constant bit rate constraint","","172","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A set of tests performed in controlled and real scenarios proves the suitability of the proposed IMM-EKF implementation as compared with low-cost GNSS-based solutions, dead reckoning systems, single-model EKF, and other filtering approaches of the current literature.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2007.902642","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4298913","Data fusion;inertial sensors;integrity;interactive multimodel (IMM);navigation systems;satellite navigation","Road vehicles;Global Positioning System;Satellite navigation systems;Vehicle safety;Safety devices;Consumer electronics;Costs;Monitoring;Sensor fusion;Sensor systems","Global Positioning System;inertial navigation;Kalman filters;nonlinear filters;road safety;road vehicles","interactive multimodel method;extended Kalman filter;inertial navigation system;satellite-based augmentation system;Global Positioning System;continuous positioning;satellite visibility;traveler information services;electronic fee-collection systems;vehicle localization;safety systems;Global Navigation Satellite System;INS;SBAS;GPS;road vehicle navigation;high-integrity IMM-EKF","","123","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Type-2 FLCs: A New Generation of Fuzzy Controllers","H. Hagras","Essex Univ., Colchester","IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","","2007","2","1","30","43","Type-1 fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs) have been applied to date with great success to many different applications. However, for dynamic unstructured environments and many real-world applications, there is a need to cope with large amounts of uncertainties. The traditional type-1 FLC using crisp type-1 fuzzy sets cannot directly handle such uncertainties. A type-2 FLC using type-2 fuzzy sets can handle such uncertainties to produce a better performance. Hence, type-2 FLCs will have the potential to overcome the limitations of type-1 FLCs and produce a new generation of fuzzy controllers with improved performance for many applications, which require handling high levels of uncertainty. This paper introduces briefly the interval type-2 FLC and its benefits. We also present briefly the type-2 FLC application to three challenging domains: industrial control, mobile robots control and ambient intelligent environments control.","1556-6048","","10.1109/MCI.2007.357192","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4195040","","Fuzzy control;Uncertainty;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy logic;Industrial control;Mobile robots;Robot control;Intelligent control;Intelligent robots;Ambient intelligence","fuzzy control;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory;industrial control;intelligent control;mobile robots","type-1 fuzzy logic controllers;type-1 fuzzy sets;type-2 fuzzy logic controllers;type-2 fuzzy sets;industrial control;mobile robot control;ambient intelligent environment control","","287","","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

DOA estimation algorithms are hindered by the effects of background noise and reverberation. Methods based on the time-differences-of-arrival (TDOA) are commonly used to determine the azimuth angle of arrival of an acoustic source. TDOA-based methods compute each relative delay using only two microphones, even though additional microphones are usually available. This paper deals with DOA estimation based on spatial spectral estimation, and establishes the parameterized spatial correlation matrix as the framework for this class of DOA estimators. This matrix jointly takes into account all pairs of microphones, and is at the heart of several broadband spatial spectral estimators, including steered-response power (SRP) algorithms. This paper reviews and evaluates these broadband spatial spectral estimators, comparing their performance to TDOA-based locators. In addition, an eigenanalysis of the parameterized spatial correlation matrix is performed and reveals that such analysis allows one to estimate the channel attenuation from factors such as uncalibrated microphones. This estimate generalizes the broadband minimum variance spatial spectral estimator to more general signal models. A DOA estimator based on the multichannel cross correlation coefficient (MCCC) is also proposed. The performance of all proposed algorithms is included in the evaluation. It is shown that adding extra microphones helps combat the effects of background noise and reverberation. Furthermore, the link between accurate spatial spectral estimation and corresponding DOA estimation is investigated. The application of the minimum variance and MCCC methods to the spatial spectral estimation problem leads to better resolution than that of the commonly used fixed-weighted SRP spectrum. However, this increased spatial spectral resolution does not always translate to more accurate DOA estimation","1558-7924","","10.1109/TASL.2006.889795","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4156192","Circular arrays;delay-and-sum beamforming (DSB);direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation;linear spatial predic tion;microphone arrays;multichannel cross correlation coefficient (MCCC);spatial correlation matrix;time delay estimation","Direction of arrival estimation;Microphones;Background noise;Reverberation;Spatial resolution;Acoustic applications;Cameras;Teleconferencing;Azimuth;Delay","acoustic correlation;direction-of-arrival estimation;matrix algebra;microphones;time-of-arrival estimation","direction of arrival estimation;parameterized spatial correlation matrix;DoA;acoustic sources;background noise;time-differences-of-arrival;azimuth angle of arrival;acoustic source;microphones;broadband spatial spectral estimation;steered-response power algorithms;multichannel cross correlation coefficient","","45","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It operates without the use of existing infrastructure. One of the principal routing protocols used in ad-hoc networks is AODV (ad-hoc on demand distance vector) protocol. The security of the AODV protocol is compromised by a particular type of attack called 'black hole' attack. In this attack a malicious node advertises itself as having the shortest path to the node whose packets it wants to intercept. To reduce the probability it is proposed to wait and check the replies from all the neighboring nodes to find a safe route.

This work studies the improvement in TC obtainable with successive interference cancellation (SIC), an important receiver technique that has been shown to achieve the capacity of several classes of multiuser channels, but has not been carefully evaluated in the context of ad hoc wireless networks. This paper develops closed-form upper bounds and easily computable lower bounds for the TC of ad hoc networks with SIC receivers, for both perfect and imperfect SIC. The analysis applies to any multiuser receiver that cancels the K strongest interfering signals by a factor z isin [0, 1]. In addition to providing the first closed-form capacity results for SIC in ad hoc networks, design-relevant insights are made possible. In particular, it is shown that SIC should be used with direct sequence spread spectrum. Also, any imperfections in the interference cancellation rapidly degrade its usefulness. More encouragingly, only a few - often just one - interfering nodes need to be canceled in order to get the vast majority of the available performance gain.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2007.901153","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4276942","Ad hoc networks;successive interference cancellation;transmission capacity (TC)","Silicon carbide;Interference cancellation;Capacity planning;Multiuser channels;Wireless networks;Upper bound;Computer networks;Signal analysis;Spread spectrum communication;Degradation","ad hoc networks;interference suppression;Poisson equation","direct sequence spread spectrum;closed-form upper bounds;multiuser channels;maximum spatial intensity;successive interference cancellation;wireless ad hoc networks;transmission capacity","","216","","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A self-managed software architecture is one in which components automatically configure their interaction in a way that is compatible with an overall architectural specification and achieves the goals of the system. The objective is to minimise the degree of explicit management necessary for construction and subsequent evolution whilst preserving the architectural properties implied by its specification.

Previous robots that automate this technique impose constraints on naturalistic walking due to their kinematic structure, and are typically operated in a stiff mode, limiting the ability of the patient or human trainer to influence the stepping pattern. We developed a pneumatic gait training robot that allows for a full range of natural motion of the legs and pelvis during treadmill walking, and provides compliant assistance. However, we observed an unexpected consequence of the devices compliance: unimpaired and SCI individuals invariably began walking out-of-phase with the device. Thus, the robot perturbed rather than assisted stepping. To address this problem, we developed a novel algorithm that synchronizes the device in real-time to the actual motion of the individual by sensing the state error and adjusting the replay timing to reduce this error. This paper describes data from experiments with individuals with SCI that demonstrate the effectiveness of the synchronization algorithm, and the potential of the device for relieving the trainers of strenuous work while maintaining naturalistic stepping.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2007.903922","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4303096","Backdrivable;gait rehabilitation;pneumatic;robot;spinal cord injury;stroke;synchronization","Motion control;Robot control;Legged locomotion;Robotics and automation;Rehabilitation robotics;Automatic control;Manuals;Spinal cord injury;Kinematics;Humans","biomechanics;medical robotics;patient rehabilitation;synchronisation","pneumatic robot;control algorithm;body-weight-supported gait training;neurologic injury;locomotor training;treadmill;rehabilitation;spinal cord injury;stroke;synchronization algorithm","Algorithms;Body Weight;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Exercise Test;Exercise Test;Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Humans;Man-Machine Systems;Movement;Robotics;Robotics;Therapy, Computer-Assisted;Therapy, Computer-Assisted;User-Computer Interface","159","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Basically, the robot consists of a set of three wires independently driven by three electric motors. The wires are connected to the patient's upper limb by means of a splint and are supported by a transportable frame, located above the patient. By controlling wire length, rehabilitation treatment (based on the passive or active-assistive spatial motion of the limb) can be delivered over a wide working space. The arm trajectory is set by the therapist through a very simple teaching-by-showing procedure, enabling most common ldquohands onrdquo therapy exercises to be reproduced by the robot. Compared to other rehabilitation robots, NeReBot offers the advantages of a low-cost mechanical structure, intrinsically safe treatment thanks to the use of wires, high acceptability by the patient, who does not feel constrained by an ldquoindustrial-likerdquo robot, transportability (it can be easily placed aside a hospital bed and/or a wheelchair), and a good trade-off between low number of DoF and spatial performance. These features and the very encouraging results of the first clinical trials make the NeReBot a good candidate for adoption in the rehabilitation treatment of subacute stroke survivors. Clinical trials were performed with a 12-patient experimental group and a 12-patient control group. Resulted that the patients who received robotic therapy in addition to conventional therapy showed greater reductions in motor impairment (in terms of Medical Research Council score, the upper limb subsection of the Fugl-Meyer score, and the Motor Status Score) and improvements in functional abilities (as measured by the Functional Independence Measure and its motor component). No adverse effects occurred and the robotic approach was very well accepted. According to these results, the NeReBot therapy may efficaciously complement standard poststroke multidisciplinary rehabilitation and offer novel therapeutic strategies for neurological rehabilitation.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2007.908560","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359232","Rehabilitation;stroke;subacute phase;upper limb;wire-driven robot;Upper limb;wire-driven robot;sub-acute phase;rehabilitation;stroke","Testing;Rehabilitation robotics;Medical treatment;Wires;Orbital robotics;Mobile robots;Clinical trials;Medical robotics;Electric motors;Motion control","biomechanics;medical robotics;neurophysiology;patient rehabilitation","wire-based robot;neurorehabilitation;clinical tests;poststroke upper-limb rehabilitation;electric motors;arm trajectory;robotic therapy;NeReBot therapy;post-stroke multidisciplinary rehabilitation","Arm;Elbow;Electrophysiology;Fingers;Hand;Hemiplegia;Hemiplegia;Humans;Motor Activity;Movement;Muscle Strength;Nervous System Diseases;Recovery of Function;Robotics","133","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Decomposing the single input image into two images is a massively ill-posed problem: In the absence of additional knowledge about the scene being viewed, there are an infinite number of valid decompositions. In this paper, we focus on an easier problem: user assisted separation in which the user interactively labels a small number of gradients as belonging to one of the layers. Even given labels on part of the gradients, the problem is still ill-posed and additional prior knowledge is needed. Following recent results on the statistics of natural images, we use a sparsity prior over derivative filters. This sparsity prior is optimized using the iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) approach. Our results show that using a prior derived from the statistics of natural images gives a far superior performance compared to a Gaussian prior and it enables good separations from a modest number of labeled gradients.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4288165","","Reflection;Glass;Statistics;Painting;Polarization;Lenses;Layout;Reflectivity;Protection;Stereo vision","computer graphics;image processing;interactive systems;least squares approximations;reflection","user assisted separation;reflections;sparsity prior;linear superposition;natural image statistics;iterative reweighted least squares approach;Gaussian prior","Algorithms;Artifacts;Artificial Intelligence;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Refractometry;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","163","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, we show that for a system with M transmit antennas and users equipped with N antennas, the sum rate scales like MloglognN for DPC, and beamforming when M is fixed and for any N (either growing to infinity or not). On the other hand, when both M and N are fixed, the sum rate of time sharing to the strongest user scales like min(M,N)loglogn. Therefore, the asymptotic gain of DPC over time sharing for the sum rate is (M/min(M,N)) when M and N are fixed. It is also shown that if M grows as logn, the sum rate of DPC and beamforming will grow linearly in M, but with different constant multiplicative factors.

Theoretically, the electrical performance of the antenna was satisfactory over a temperature range of 15degC-35degC, and stable for patient-antenna distances to as low as 4 cm. In an experimental cylindrical setup using six elements of the final patch design, we measured the impedance characteristics of the antenna 1) to establish its performance in the applicator and 2) to validate the simulations. For this experimental setup we simulated and measured comparable values: -21 dB reflection at 433 MHz and a bandwidth of 18.5 MHz.

Minimizing the number of switching devices has been in power converters that is the main method to reduce drive costs. Single-switch-per-phase converters have been cost effective due to the compactness of the converter package resulting in a possible reduction in their cost. However, some of the single-switch-per-phase converters have the drawbacks that include higher losses and low-system efficiency. In order to overcome these shortcomings, the choice narrows down to the split ac converter through the quantitative analysis in terms of device ratings, cost, switching losses, conduction losses, and converter efficiency. Simulations to verify the characteristics of the converter circuit and control feasibility are presented. The motor drive is realized with a novel two-phase flux-reversal-free-stator SRM and a split ac converter. The efficiency with various loads is numerically estimated and experimentally compared from the viewpoint of subsystem and system in details.

"Optimal Spinning Reserve for a Wind-Thermal Power System Using EIPSO","T. Lee","NA","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","","2007","22","4","1612","1621","This paper presents an evolutionary iteration particle swarm optimization (EIPSO) algorithm to solve the nonlinear optimal scheduling problem. A new index called iteration best is incorporated into particle swarm optimization (PSO) to improve the solution quality. The new PSO, named iteration PSO (IPSO), is embedded into evolutionary programming (EP) to further improve the computational efficiency. The EIPSO is then applied to solve the optimal spinning reserve for a wind-thermal power system (OSRWT). Results are used to evaluate the effects of wind generation on the spinning reserve selection of a power system. The OSRWT program considers the outage cost as well as the total operation cost of thermal units to evaluate the level of spinning reserve. The up spinning reserve (USR) and down spinning reserve (DSR) are also introduced into the OSRWT problem.

The obtained modeling shows that modulated multilevel voltages are obtained by combination of eight different three-level functions, which are called modulation functions. Therefore, a space-vector scheme without using a Park transform is explained. Based on this algorithm, the location of the reference voltage vector can be easily determined. Then, the voltage vectors are selected to generate corresponding levels and simultaneously their durations are calculated. More over, the redundancies of different switch configurations for the generation of intermediate voltages are used to limit the deviation of capacitor voltages. Experimental results are given to illustrate the proposed control strategy of the three-phase three-level diode clamped inverter.

Hence, a modulator must use some secondary criteria such as cell voltage balancing to fully define the converter switched state. Alternatively, the modulator can be adapted to directly specify the cell states, such as has been proposed for the harmonically optimal phase disposition (PD) strategy. However the techniques reported to date can lead to uneven distribution of switching transitions between cells, and the synthesis of narrow switched phase leg pulses. This paper presents an improved strategy that decouples the tasks of voltage level selection and switching event distribution. Conventional PD and centered space vector pulsewidth modulation (CSVPWM) strategies are used to define the target voltage level for the converter, and a finite state machine is then used to distribute the transitions to the converter cells in a cyclical fashion. Experimental results for a four-level flying capacitor inverter are presented, verifying that the natural balancing properties of this converter has been preserved, the cell switching utilization is equal and the expected harmonic gains of PD and CSVPWM compared to phase shifted carrier PWM have been achieved","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2006.889932","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4118318","Flying capacitor;multicell;multilevel space vector modulation (SVM);natural balance;phase disposition (PD);stacked multicell (SMC)","Capacitors;Decoding;Voltage;Pulse width modulation converters;Phase modulation;Leg;Switching converters;Pulse width modulation inverters;Space vector pulse width modulation;Pulse modulation","capacitors;finite state machines;invertors;PWM power convertors;switching convertors","optimal modulation;flying capacitor;stacked multicell converters;state machine decoder;cell voltage balancing;optical phase deposition strategy;voltage level selection;switching event distribution;centered space vector pulsewidth modulation;finite state machine;cell switching utilization","","159","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The problem becomes more difficult in very reverberant conditions, with an increasing number of sources, and geometric configurations of the sources such that finding directionality is not sufficient for source separation. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that exploits higher order frequency dependencies of source signals in order to separate them when they are mixed. In the frequency domain, this formulation assumes that dependencies exist between frequency bins instead of defining independence for each frequency bin. In this manner, we can avoid the well-known frequency permutation problem. To derive the learning algorithm, we define a cost function, which is an extension of mutual information between multivariate random variables. By introducing a source prior that models the inherent frequency dependencies, we obtain a simple form of a multivariate score function. In experiments, we generate simulated data with various kinds of sources in various environments. We evaluate the performances and compare it with other well-known algorithms. The results show the proposed algorithm outperforms the others in most cases. The algorithm is also able to accurately recover six sources with six microphones. In this case, we can obtain about 16-dB signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) improvement.

The problem is classified as constrained mixed integer nonlinear programming with multimodal characteristics. The objective functions considered are the system real power losses, fuel cost, and the gaseous emissions of the generating units. Two different types of fuel cost functions are considered in this study, namely the conventional quadratic function and the augmented quadratic function to introduce more accurate modeling that incorporates the valve loading effects. The latter model presents nondifferentiable and nonconvex regions that challenge most gradient-based optimization algorithms. The proposed algorithm makes use of the PSO, known for its global searching capabilities, to allocate the optimal control settings while Newton-Raphson algorithm minimizes the mismatch of the power flow equations. A hybrid inequality constraint handling mechanism that preserves only feasible solutions without the need to augment the original objective function is incorporated in the proposed approach. To demonstrate its robustness, the proposed algorithm was tested on the IEEE 30-bus system with six generating units. Several cases were investigated to test and validate the consistency of detecting optimal or near optimal solution for each objective. Results are compared to solutions obtained of MATPOWER software outcomes that employs sequential quadratic programming algorithm to solve the OPF.

"RFID Indoor Tracking based on Inter-tags Distance Measurement","A. Bekkali; M. Matsumoto","GITS, Waseda Univ., Tokyo; GITS, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan","2007 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium","","2007","","","1","1","Summary form only given. Indoor tracking and localization is a crucial ingredient in many ubiquitous computing applications and robotics. In many applications there is the need to know the location of the objects. While in the near future everything will be tagged with radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, the localization of these tags in their environment is becoming an important feature for the RFID based ubiquitous computing applications. Due to its lower cost and its technical capabilities, RFID tagged object tracking can have a wide diverse variety of applications including scientific, military, and public safety. In this paper we propose a tracking algorithm for objects attached by UHF RFID tags by means of two RFID antennas and landmarks to reduce the localization cost and environment complexity. This algorithm uses RFID map made from passive or active references tags with known location (landmarks) to locate any unknown tag detected by the RFID reader antennas. It measures the distances between the readers and the common detected tags using the large scale path loss propagation model, and calculates the distance between the unknown tag and all the detected landmarks (inter-tags distance). With the multilateration technique the system is able to estimate the position of the unknown tag. The location estimation of the target will be independent to the reader's position. The research challenge corresponds to achieve an accurate indoor tracking system using two mobile RFID readers taking in consideration the limitation of RFID technology. This tracking algorithm is based on received signal strength (RSS) measurement to measure the reader-tags distance and target-landmarks distance to estimate the target location.

In such a circuit, the oscillator jitter, tuning response, start-up transient, and frequency switching transient play an important role in the TDCs measurement time and accuracy. In this work, we discuss the design of an optimized, differential CML-based ring oscillator and its impact on a TDC design. Simulation results from the new oscillator show that the oscillator's short start-up and frequency switching transients have negligible effects on the accuracy of the TDC measurements.

The arrival of the first and second voltage traveling waves at both ends of the power cables can be identified reliably. The developed wavelet processing scheme is applied on the modal coordinates instead of the phase coordinates. The proposed scheme has the ability to eliminate the impact of the change in the propagation velocity of the traveling waves on the fault-location calculations. This will help solve the problem of cable changing parameters, especially the change of the relative permittivity of the cable with age. The method is valid even with faults that are very close to busbars. Characteristics of the proposed fault-location scheme are analyzed by extensive simulation studies using Alternative Transients Program/Electromagnetic Transients Program.

The attraction of producing, and exploiting nanoparticles (NPs; one dimension less than 100 nm) is a consequence of the fact that the properties are often strikingly different from bulk forms composed from the same material. As a consequence, the field of nanotechnology has generated substantial interest resulting in incorporation of NPs into a wide variety of products including electronics, food, clothing, medicines, cosmetics and sporting equipment. While there is general recognition that nanotechnology has the potential to advance science, quality of life and to generate substantial financial gains, a number of reports suggest that potential toxicity should be considered in order to allow the safe and sustainable development of such products. For example, substances which are ordinarily innocuous can elicit toxicity due to the altered chemical and physical properties that become evident within nano dimensions leading to potentially detrimental consequences for the producer, consumer or environment. Research into respirable air pollution particles (PM10) has focused on the role of ultra fine particle (diameter less than 100 nm) in inducing oxidative stress leading to inflammation and resulting in exacerbation of preexisting respiratory and cardiovascular disease. Epidemiological studies have repeatedly found a positive correlation between the level of particulate air pollution and increased morbidity and mortality rates in both adults and children. Such studies have also identified a link between respiratory ill health and the number of ambient ultrafine particles. In vivo and in vitro toxicology studies confirm that for low solubility, low toxicity materials such as TiO2, carbon black and polystyrene beads, ultrafine particles are more toxic and inflammogenic than fine particles. In many of these studies the term ""ultrafine particle"" can be directly exchanged for nanoparticle, as these particles are manufactured industrially. In such studies the NPs generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) to a greater extent than larger particles leading to increased transcription of pro-inflammatory mediators via intracellular signaling pathways including calcium and oxidative stress. To date, only limited NP compositions and structures have been tested, including materials such as carbon, polystyrene beads and TiO2 as surrogate particles that aimed to represent particulate air pollution. All of these materials are generally low toxicity and low solubility. Much work is required to identify whether the conclusions made for such materials can be extrapolated to engineered nanoparticles varying not only in size but also, shape, composition, structure, surface area, surface coating, and aggregation state. Therefore, it is necessary to reveal if the diversity of NPs available will confer to a varied extent and mechanisms of toxicity.","1558-2639","","10.1109/TNB.2007.909005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4378199","Air pollution;calcium;nanoparticles;NF-$\kappa$B;oxidative stress;quantum dots;ultrafine;air pollution, , , , , ,;nanoparticles;ultrafine;oxidative stress;calcium;NF-º B;quantum dots","Air pollution;Toxicology;Nanotechnology;Biological materials;Nanoparticles;Stress;Organic materials;Carbon dioxide;Composite materials;Surface contamination","air pollution;carbon;cellular biophysics;molecular biophysics;nanobiotechnology;nanoparticles;polymers;solubility;titanium compounds;toxicology","air pollution;nanoparticle toxicology;cellular interactions;molecular interactions;ultrafine particle;reactive oxygen species;toxicity;solubility;carbon black;polystyrene beads","Adult;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cell Physiology;Child;Hazardous Waste;Humans;Industrial Waste;Inflammation;Inflammation;Inhalation Exposure;Lung Diseases;Lung Diseases;Nanoparticles;Oxidative Stress;Particle Size;Particulate Matter;Particulate Matter;Reactive Oxygen Species;Silicones;Silicones","212","","114","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A group of ten PD patients treated with subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) and ten normal control subjects followed a protocol of typical daily activities and the whole period of the measurement was recorded by video. Walking periods were recognized using two sensors on shanks and lying periods were detected using a sensor on trunk. By calculating kinematics features of the trunk movements during the transitions between sitting and standing postures and using a statistical classifier, sit-to-stand (SiSt) and stand-to-sit (StSi) transitions were detected and separated from other body movements. Finally, a fuzzy classifier used this information to detect periods of sitting and standing. The proposed method showed a high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of basic body postures allocations: sitting, standing, lying, and walking periods, both in PD patients and healthy subjects. We found significant differences in parameters related to SiSt and StSi transitions between PD patients and controls and also between PD patients with and without STN-DBS turned on. We concluded that our method provides a simple, accurate, and effective means to objectively quantify physical activities in both normal and PD patients and may prove useful to assess the level of motor functions in the latter.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2007.896591","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359998","Biomedical signal processing;fuzzy logic;Parkinson's disease (PD);physical activity;subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS);wearable technology;Biomedical signal processing;fuzzy logic;Parkinson's disease (PD);physical activity;subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS);wearable technology","Patient monitoring;Parkinson's disease;Legged locomotion;Medical treatment;Brain stimulation;Protocols;Nuclear measurements;Kinematics;Sensitivity and specificity;PD control","biomechanics;biomedical equipment;biomedical measurement;bone;brain;diseases;fuzzy logic;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;patient monitoring","ambulatory monitoring;physical activities;patients;Parkinson disease;body-fixed inertial sensors;subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation;shanks;kinematics;trunk movements;statistical classifier;sit-to-stand transition;stand-to-sit transition;body movements;fuzzy classifier;sitting;standing;body postures;lying;walking","Acceleration;Activities of Daily Living;Artificial Intelligence;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electric Stimulation Therapy;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Motor Activity;Parkinson Disease;Parkinson Disease;Parkinson Disease;Treatment Outcome","126","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A wideband ring oscillator-based frequency synthesizer having a large frequency step was used to downconvert a cluster of channels to a sliding low-IF frequency, while the second downconversion to baseband was performed in the digital domain. Eliminating the inductors and using a small-area oscillator has reduced both the parasitic magnetic and substrate coupling, allowing single-chip integration of the sensitive tuner and the noisy digital demodulator. A significant reduction in die area was achieved by using a single oscillator to cover the entire satellite TV spectrum, while a noise attenuator was cascaded with the PLL passive loop filter to reduce the equivalent VCO tuning gain.

Assuming that the occluded vehicles are segmented from the road background by a previously proposed vehicle segmentation method and that a deformable model is geometrically fitted onto the occluded vehicles, the proposed method first deduces the number of vertices per individual vehicle from the camera configuration. Second, a contour description model is utilized to describe the direction of the contour segments with respect to its vanishing points, from which individual contour description and vehicle count are determined. Third, it assigns a resolvability index to each occluded vehicle based on a resolvability model, from which each occluded vehicle model is resolved and the vehicle dimension is measured. The proposed method has been tested on 267 sets of real-world monocular traffic images containing 3074 vehicles with multiple-vehicle occlusions and is found to be 100% accurate in calculating vehicle count, in comparison with human inspection. By comparing the estimated dimensions of the resolved generalized deformable model of the vehicle with the actual dimensions published by the manufacturers, the root-mean-square error for width, length, and height estimations are found to be 48, 279, and 76 mm, respectively.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2007.902647","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4298908","Deformable model;occlusion;occlusion reasoning;resolvability;vehicle counting;vehicle segmentation;vehicle tracking","Road vehicles;Traffic control;Image segmentation;Deformable models;Image resolution;Image sequences;Cameras;Testing;Humans;Inspection","image segmentation;image sequences;mean square error methods;road vehicles;target tracking;traffic engineering computing","vehicle count;multiple-vehicle occlusions;monocular traffic image sequence;road vehicle;vehicle segmentation;deformable model;contour description model;resolvability index;resolvability model;root-mean-square error;vehicle tracking","","51","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The organizational culture of NASA, for example, was specifically identified by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) as one of the causes of faulty communication leading to a terribly tragic event. The Challenger investigations of 20 years earlier, on the other hand, focused primarily on physical events, secondarily on professional judgments, and only little on the social and cultural context of the disaster.

Hybrid control is a general approach for control of a switching-based hybrid system (HS). This class of HS includes a continuous process controlled by a discrete controller with a finite number of states. In the case of ac motor drives, in contrast to conventional vector control like proportional-integral control or predictive control, where the inverter is not taken into account by the controller, hybrid control integrates the inverter model and considers the state of the inverter as a control variable. It allows to obtain faster torque dynamics than vector-control algorithms. The hybrid control algorithm requires both computing velocity for real-time implementation and code flexibility for management of low-performance functions and analog-digital interfaces. Codesign appears as a promising methodology for partitioning hybrid-control algorithm between software (flexible) and hardware (velocity) while taking care of overall time constrains. In this paper, the implementation of hybrid-control algorithm for a PMSM drive is performed through a codesign approach on an Excalibur board, embedding a CPU-core (Nios-2 by Altera) inside an APEX20KE200EFC484-2X field-programmable gate array. The partitioning of software and hardware parts is explained. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the implementation.

An analytic model for the zero-load latency of each network that considers the effects of the topology on the performance of a 3D NoC is developed. Tradeoffs between the number of nodes utilized in the third dimension, which reduces the average number of hops traversed by a packet, and the number of physical planes used to integrate the functional blocks of the network, which decreases the length of the communication channel, is evaluated for both the latency and power consumption of a network.

"Storage of fluctuating wind energy","E. Lerch","SIEMENS AG PTD SE PTI NC P.O. Box 3220 91050 Erlangen, Germany","2007 European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","","2007","","","1","8","Over the last 15 years wind energy becomes more and more important in Germany. The total installed capacity of wind generation was 19300 MW (June 2006) with new installation of about 900 MW in the first 3 months in 2006. In 2010 the contribution of renewable energy to the gross electricity consumption shall be 12.5 per cent (renewable energy sources act EEG) and in 2020 20 per cent. The acceptance of utilisation of wind power in Germany is very high. Wind energy supply varies over day time, over the year and regional. In addition demand of electrical power varies over daytime and over the year but not correlated with the variation of wind. The average full load hours of the German wind generation is about 1600 h/a and will increase 2010 to about 1960 h/a based on increasing off-shore wind parks in Germany. In 2010 24 GW wind plants are planned on-shore, in the North Sea additional 4.4 GW off-shore wind parks and in the Baltic Sea about 1 GW off-shore wind generation. This will increase 2015 to 8.4 GW (North Sea) and 1.4 GW (Baltic Sea). The load centers in Germany are in the central and southern parts of Germany far away from the main wind park locations at the coasts or off-shore. To transport this high power to the load centers some hundred kilometre of new AC and DC lines have to be built together with new compensation and control equipment to strengthen and operate the system securely. 4 main corridors each with a capacity of 2000-4000 MW are necessary to bring the power to the load centers. In the last years there is a discussion about the necessity of such a large improvement of the system and the possibilities to solve the transportation targets closer related to the average available wind power and not related to the size of installed wind power capacity. A possible alternative is the installation of energy storage systems based on compressed air (so called compressed air energy storage CAES) stored in large underground caverns. The paper will show the available technology and the possibilities to combine this storage equipment with wind parks to use wind parks in a way of quasi conventional power plants.","","978-92-75815-10-8","10.1109/EPE.2007.4417781","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4417781","wind energy;wind generator systems;renewable energy systems;energy storage","Energy storage;Wind energy;Wind energy generation;Renewable energy resources;Energy consumption;Electroencephalography;Control equipment;Transportation;Paper technology;Power generation","energy storage;wind power","fluctuating wind energy;energy storage;wind generation;renewable energy;wind energy","","6","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The system collects locally-generated peer feedbacks and aggregates them to yield the global reputation scores. Surprisingly, most previous work ignored the distribution of peer feedbacks. We use a trust overlay network (TON) to model the trust relationships among peers. After examining the eBay transaction trace of over 10,000 users, we discover a power-law distribution in user feedbacks. Our mathematical analysis justifies that power-law distribution is applicable to any dynamically growing P2P systems, either structured or unstructured. We develop a robust and scalable P2P reputation system, PowerTrust, to leverage the power-law feedback characteristics. The PowerTrust system dynamically selects small number of power nodes that are most reputable using a distributed ranking mechanism. By using a look-ahead random walk strategy and leveraging the power nodes, PowerTrust significantly improves in global reputation accuracy and aggregation speed. PowerTrust is adaptable to dynamics in peer joining and leaving and robust to disturbance by malicious peers. Through P2P network simulation experiments, we find significant performance gains in using PowerTrust.

We have demonstrated that with careful design optimization, the presented light-trapping structure can lead to a remarkable cell-efficiency enhancement for the cells with very thin silicon active layers (typically 2.0-10.0 mum) due to the significantly enhanced absorption in the wavelength range of 800-1100 nm. On the other hand, less enhancement has been predicted for much thicker cells (i.e.,>100 mum) due to the limited absorption increase in this wavelength range. According to our simulation, the overall cell efficiency can be doubled for a 2.0-mum-thick cell with light-trapping structure. It is found that the improvement is mainly contributed by the optimized AR coating and diffraction grating with the corresponding relative improvements of 36% and 54%, respectively.

However, algorithms that approach the DPC sum capacity do not appear viable in the forseeable future, which motivates lower complexity interference suppression techniques. Block diagonalization (BD) is a linear preceding technique for downlink multiuser MIMO systems. With perfect channel knowledge at the transmitter, BD can eliminate other users' interference at each receiver. In this paper, we study the sum capacity of BD with and without receive antenna selection. We analytically compare BD without receive antenna selection to DPC for a set of given channels. It is shown that (1) if the user channels are orthogonal to each other, then BD achieves the same sum capacity as DPC; (2) if the user channels lie in the same subspace, then the gain of DPC over BD can be upper bounded by the minimum of the number of transmit and receive antennas. These observations also hold for BD with receive antenna selection. Further, we study the ergodic sum capacity of BD with and without receive antenna selection in a Rayleigh fading channel. Simulations show that BD can achieve a significant part of the total throughput of DPC. An upper bound on the ergodic sum capacity gain of DPC over BD is proposed for easy estimation of the gap between the sum capacity of DPC and BD without receive antenna selection.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2007.05831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4251145","","MIMO;Broadcasting;Receiving antennas;Interference suppression;Downlink;Transmitters;Interference elimination;Fading;Throughput;Upper bound","broadcast channels;Gaussian channels;interference suppression;linear predictive coding;MIMO communication;multiuser channels;Rayleigh channels;receiving antennas;transmitting antennas","ergodic sum capacity gain;Rayleigh fading channel;transmitting antennas;receiving antenna selection;linear preceding technique;interference suppression techniques;DPC sum capacity;dirty paper coding;Gaussian channel;downlink multiple input multiple output system;multiuser MIMO broadcast channel","","87","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike most existing denoising algorithms, using the SURE makes it needless to hypothesize a statistical model for the noiseless image. A key point of our approach is that, although the (nonlinear) processing is performed in a transformed domain-typically, an undecimated discrete wavelet transform, but we also address nonorthonormal transforms-this minimization is performed in the image domain. Indeed, we demonstrate that, when the transform is a ldquotightrdquo frame (an undecimated wavelet transform using orthonormal filters), separate subband minimization yields substantially worse results. In order for our approach to be viable, we add another principle, that the denoising process can be expressed as a linear combination of elementary denoising processes-linear expansion of thresholds (LET). Armed with the SURE and LET principles, we show that a denoising algorithm merely amounts to solving a linear system of equations which is obviously fast and efficient. Quite remarkably, the very competitive results obtained by performing a simple threshold (image-domain SURE optimized) on the undecimated Haar wavelet coefficients show that the SURE-LET principle has a huge potential.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2007.906002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4337754","","Image denoising;Noise reduction;PSNR;Discrete wavelet transforms;Wavelet coefficients;Biomedical imaging;Gaussian noise;Wavelet domain;Filters;Linear systems","discrete wavelet transforms;Haar transforms;image denoising;mean square error methods","image denoising;mean squared error;Steins unbiased risk estimate;discrete wavelet transform;nonorthonormal transforms;linear expansion of thresholds;linear equations system;Haar wavelet coefficients;SURE-LET principle","Algorithms;Artifacts;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Models, Statistical;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","213","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, developing such a system is always challenging due to the richness, ambiguity, and dynamic nature of facial actions. Although a number of research groups attempt to recognize facial action units (AUs) by improving either the facial feature extraction techniques or the AU classification techniques, these methods often recognize AUs or certain AU combinations individually and statically, ignoring the semantic relationships among AUs and the dynamics of AUs. Hence, these approaches cannot always recognize AUs reliably, robustly, and consistently. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that systematically accounts for the relationships among AUs and their temporal evolutions for AU recognition. Specifically, we use a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) to model the relationships among different AUs. The DBN provides a coherent and unified hierarchical probabilistic framework to represent probabilistic relationships among various AUs and to account for the temporal changes in facial action development. Within our system, robust computer vision techniques are used to obtain AU measurements. Such AU measurements are then applied as evidence to the DBN for inferring various AUs. The experiments show that the integration of AU relationships and AU dynamics with AU measurements yields significant improvement of AU recognition, especially for spontaneous facial expressions and under more realistic environment including illumination variation, face pose variation, and occlusion.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1094","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4293201","Facial Action Unit Recognition;Facial Expression Analysis;Facial Action Coding System;Bayesian Networks","Face recognition;Gold;Facial features;Humans;Robustness;Real time systems;Facial animation;Computer vision;Lighting;Bayesian methods","Bayes methods;computer vision;face recognition;feature extraction;image classification","occlusion;face pose variation;illumination variation;facial expressions;computer vision;unified hierarchical probabilistic framework;dynamic Bayesian network;AU classification techniques;facial feature extraction techniques;semantic relationships;dynamic relationships;facial action unit recognition","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Bayes Theorem;Biometry;Face;Face;Facial Expression;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Semantics;Sensitivity and Specificity","220","","41","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Surface EMG sensors were used to record a sequence of forearm EMG potential signals via a PC sound card and a novel 3-D electromagnetic positioning system together with a data-glove mounted with 11 miniature electromagnetic sensors used to acquire corresponding human hand pose in real time. The synchronized measurements of hand posture and associated EMG signals stored as prototypes embody a numerical expression of the current hand shape in the form of a series of data frames, each comprising a set of postures and associated EMG data. This allows a computer generated graphical 3-D model, combined with synthesized EMG signals, to be used to evaluate the approach. This graphical user interface could also enable handicapped users to practice controlling a robotic prosthetic hand using EMG signals derived from their forearm muscles. We believe this task might be made easier using a dictionary of stored task-specific prototype data frames acquired from able-bodied users. By comparing the resulting EMG data frames with stored prototypes, the most likely data frame sequence can be identified and used to control a robotic hand so that it carries out the user's desire. We explore the feasibility of this approach by applying frequency analysis on the signal derived from a multichannel EMG measurement device and identify pattern recognition techniques in the time and frequency domains to determine plausible hand shapes. This approach offers several advantages over existing methods. First, it simplifies the classification procedure, saving computational time and the requirement for the optimization process, and second, it increases the number of recognizable hand shapes, which in turn improves the dexterity of the prosthetic hand and the quality of life for amputees. The database of EMG prototypes could be employed to optimize the accuracy of the system within a machine learning paradigm.

The basic approach used in this algorithm is to extract the fundamental component of load current and source voltage by using wavelet-transform decomposition. Then, the amplitude, phase angle, and frequency of fundamental component are calculated using the well-known LS algorithm, which is relatively simple and fast.

The objective of the proposed technique is to capture the fundamental phase angle and angular frequency of three-phase clean, distorted, balanced or unbalanced ac utilities. The PLL gives fast, accurate angular frequency and phase locking and is robust to utility distortion such as line notching, random noise, voltage imbalance, phase loss, phase imbalance, harmonics, dc offsets and frequency variation. The analysis presented substantiates the immunity of the proposed PLL to unbalanced and distorted utility conditions. The PLL technique is simulated and digital signal processor (DSP)-implemented for a three-phase system to verify the analytical results. The simulated and experimental results, for numerous utility conditions, demonstrate its phase-tracking ability, whereas the conventional technique fails to lock accurately in highly distorted, three-phase grid-connected operation.","1751-8679","","10.1049/iet-epa:20070036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4374061","","","digital signal processing chips;distortion;filtering theory;phase locked loops;PI control;power system control","three-phase phase-lock loop;distorted utilities;ac utility voltages;proportional-integral-controlled moving average filter;angular frequency;fundamental phase angle;digital signal processor;three-phase system;phase-tracking ability;three-phase grid-connected operation","","31","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals"

This score function is the likelihood ratio: the ratio of the probability density function (pdf) of a measurement having originated from a track, to the pdf of this measurement having a different origin. The likelihood ratio score is derived rigorously starting from the fully Bayesian MHT (hypothesis oriented, based on combinatorial analysis of the general multitarget problem), which is shown to be amenable under some (reasonable) assumptions to the track-oriented MHT (TOMHT). The latter can be implemented efficiently using multidimensional assignment (MDA). The main feature of a likelihood ratio is the fact that it is a (physically) dimensionless quantity and, consequently, can be used for the association of different numbers of measurements and/or measurements of different dimension. The explicit forms of the likelihood ratio are discussed both for the commonly used Kalman tracking filter, as well as for the interacting multiple model (IMM) estimator. The issues of measurements of different dimension and different coordinate systems together with the selection of certain MHT design parameters - the spatial densities of the false measurements and new targets - are also discussed.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2007.357141","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4194779","","Target tracking;Density measurement;Bayesian methods;Multidimensional systems;Coordinate measuring machines;Probability density function;Kalman filters;Signal processing;Data processing;Data engineering","belief networks;probability;target tracking","dimensionless score function;multiple hypothesis tracking;measurement-to-track association;assignment decision;track oriented version;multiple hypothesis tracker;Bayesian MHT;Kalman tracking filter;interacting multiple model","","62","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compressed sensing (CS) is an emerging field which is based on the revelation that a small collection of linear projections of a sparse signal contains enough information for reconstruction. In this paper, we propose an application of compressed sensing in the field of biomedical signal processing, particularly electroencophelogram (EEG) collection and storage. A compressed sensing framework is introduced for efficient representation of multichannel, multiple trial EEG data. The proposed framework is based on the revelation that EEG signals are sparse in a Gabor frame. The sparsity of EEG signals in a Gabor frame is utilized for compressed sensing of these signals.

In order to be able to avoid the occurrence of visually inconsistent results, we pose all of the above image-editing tasks in the form of a discrete global optimization problem. The objective function of this problem is always well-defined, and corresponds to the energy of a discrete Markov random field (MRF). For efficiently optimizing this MRF, a novel optimization scheme, called priority belief propagation (BP), is then proposed, which carries two very important extensions over the standard BP algorithm: ldquopriority-based message schedulingrdquo and ldquodynamic label pruning.rdquo These two extensions work in cooperation to deal with the intolerable computational cost of BP, which is caused by the huge number of labels associated with our MRF. Moreover, both of our extensions are generic, since they do not rely on the use of domain-specific prior knowledge. They can, therefore, be applied to any MRF, i.e., to a very wide class of problems in image processing and computer vision, thus managing to resolve what is currently considered as one major limitation of the BP algorithm: its inefficiency in handling MRFs with very large discrete state spaces. Experimental results on a wide variety of input images are presented, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our image-completion framework for tasks such as object removal, texture synthesis, text removal, and image inpainting.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2007.906269","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4337762","Belief propagation (BP);image completion;Markov random fields (MRFs);optimization;texture synthesis","Belief propagation;Dynamic scheduling;Markov random fields;Scheduling algorithm;Processor scheduling;Computational efficiency;Image processing;Computer vision;Image resolution;State-space methods","image texture;Markov processes;optimisation;scheduling","computer vision;image processing;domain-specific prior knowledge;dynamic label pruning;priority-based message scheduling;discrete Markov random field;discrete global optimization problem;image-editing tasks;image inpainting;texture synthesis;belief propagation;image completion;object removal;text removal","Algorithms;Artifacts;Artificial Intelligence;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","212","","41","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The base station (BS) transmitter is equipped with a scheduler using a simple opportunistic beamforming strategy, which associates an intended user for each of the transmitted data streams. For the case when the channel of the scheduled users is available at the BS, we propose a general method for joint design of the transmit and the receive beamformers according to different optimization criteria, including weighted sum rate maximization, weighted sum mean square error minimization, minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) maximization and sum power minimization under a minimum SINR constraint. The proposed method can handle multiple antennas at the BS and at the mobile user with single and/or multiple data streams per scheduled user. The optimization problems encountered in the beamformer design (e.g., covariance rank constraint) are not convex in general. Therefore, the problem of finding the global optimum is intrinsically nontractable. However, by exploiting the uplink-downlink SINR duality, we decompose the original optimization problem as a series of simpler optimization problems which can be efficiently solved by using standard convex optimization tools. Even though each subproblem is optimally solved, there is no guarantee that the global optimum has been found due to the nonconvexity of the problem. However, the simulations show that the algorithms converge fast to a solution, which can be a local optimum, but is still efficient.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2007.896292","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4291846","Beamforming;broadcast channels;convex optimization;geometric programming;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems","MIMO;Downlink;Signal to noise ratio;Constraint optimization;Design optimization;Minimization methods;Base stations;Transmitters;Array signal processing;Design methodology","broadcast channels;convex programming;MIMO communication;mobile radio;multiuser channels;wireless channels","Tx-Rx beamformers;MIMO downlink channel;single-cell multiple-input multiple-output channel;linear transmission strategy;linear reception strategy;base station transmitter;data streams;weighted sum rate maximization;weighted sum mean square error minimization;minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;sum power minimization;multiple antennas;convex optimization tools;broadcast channel","","110","","66","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, it is shown that a time-varying dynamical pattern can be effectively represented in a time-invariant and spatially distributed manner through deterministic learning. Second, a definition for characterizing similarity of dynamical patterns is given based on system dynamics inherently within dynamical patterns. Third, a mechanism for rapid recognition of dynamical patterns is presented, by which a test dynamical pattern is recognized as similar to a training dynamical pattern if state synchronization is achieved according to a kind of internal and dynamical matching on system dynamics. The synchronization errors can be taken as the measure of similarity between the test and training patterns. The significance of the paper is that a completely dynamical approach is proposed, in which the problem of dynamical pattern recognition is turned into the stability and convergence of a recognition error system.

Second, the edges are extracted from the enhanced image by the two-stage edge detection operator that identifies the edge candidates based on the local characteristics of the image and then determines the true edge pixels using the edge detection operator based on the extremum of the gradient values.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to solve the supervised dimensionality reduction problem by encoding an image object as a general tensor of second or even higher order. First, we propose a discriminant tensor criterion, whereby multiple interrelated lower dimensional discriminative subspaces are derived for feature extraction. Then, a novel approach, called k-mode optimization, is presented to iteratively learn these subspaces by unfolding the tensor along different tensor directions. We call this algorithm multilinear discriminant analysis (MDA), which has the following characteristics: 1) multiple interrelated subspaces can collaborate to discriminate different classes, 2) for classification problems involving higher order tensors, the MDA algorithm can avoid the curse of dimensionality dilemma and alleviate the small sample size problem, and 3) the computational cost in the learning stage is reduced to a large extent owing to the reduced data dimensions in k-mode optimization. We provide extensive experiments on ORL, CMU PIE, and FERET databases by encoding face images as second- or third-order tensors to demonstrate that the proposed MDA algorithm based on higher order tensors has the potential to outperform the traditional vector-based subspace learning algorithms, especially in the cases with small sample sizes","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2006.884929","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4032832","2-D LDA;2-D PCA;linear discriminant analysis (LDA);multilinear algebra;principal component analysis (PCA);subspace learning","Face recognition;Tensile stress;Principal component analysis;Linear discriminant analysis;Asia;Algorithm design and analysis;Image coding;Iterative algorithms;Unsupervised learning;Feature extraction","face recognition;feature extraction;image coding;optimisation;tensors","multilinear discriminant analysis;face recognition;subspace learning techniques;supervised dimensionality reduction problem;image object encoding;discriminant tensor criterion;feature extraction;MDA;k-mode optimization;dimensionality dilemma;higher order tensors","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biometry;Computer Simulation;Discriminant Analysis;Face;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Linear Models;Models, Biological;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated","233","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In parallel, we perform multi-view/multi-category object recognition to detect cars and pedestrians in both camera images. Using the SfM self-localization, 2D object detections are converted to 3D observations, which are accumulated in a world coordinate frame. A subsequent tracking module analyzes the resulting 3D observations to find physically plausible spacetime trajectories.

High-frequency reference signals are generated by a highly stable optical two-tone generator, which is used for high-rate communication and astronomical application. One method to generate two optical signals is producing them from a pair of laser sources using an optical phase-locked loop for feed back control; however, the optical phase-locked loop has a stability problem in its operation. A good alternative method to the optical phase-locked scheme is the LiNbO3 Mach-Zehnder (MZ) optical intensity modulator, which is capable of generating two highly stable optical signals (upper sideband and lower sideband components) by applying a sinusoidal microwave signal to an input laser signal. The two optical signals require phase stability better than 10-13 in the Allan standard deviation, vibration robustness, and polarization maintaining capability. The signal coherence loss estimated from the phase stability of the two optical signals generated by the MZ modulator shows that the optical MZ modulator has the ability to generate highly stable optical signals.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2007.904070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4298209","Allan variance;high-frequency signal generator;lithium niobate Mach–Zehnder (MZ) modulator;phase stability","Extinction ratio;Optical modulation;Signal generators;Laser stability;Optical devices;Phase modulation;Phase locked loops;Optical control;Robust stability;Feeds","circuit feedback;modulators;optical modulation;optical signal detection;phase locked loops;signal generators;standards","Mach-Zehnder modulator;optical signal generator;optical modulator;reference signals;optical phase-locked loop;feedback control;Allan standard deviation;vibration robustness;polarization","","89","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the main hurdles that hinder such a development is the challenge of building an ankle-foot prosthesis that matches the size and weight of the intact ankle, but still provides a sufficiently large instantaneous power output and torque to propel an amputee. In this paper, we present a novel, powered ankle-foot prosthesis that overcomes these design challenges. The prosthesis comprises an unidirectional spring, configured in parallel with a force-controllable actuator with series elasticity. With this architecture, the ankle-foot prosthesis matches the size and weight of the human ankle, and is shown to be satisfying the restrictive design specifications dictated by normal human ankle walking biomechanics.","1945-7901","978-1-4244-1319-5","10.1109/ICORR.2007.4428441","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4428441","","Prosthetics;Humans;Buildings;Torque;Propulsion;Springs;Actuators;Elasticity;Legged locomotion;Biomechanics","actuators;biomechanics;elasticity;medical control systems;prosthetics;springs (mechanical)","biomechanical prosthesis design;powered ankle-foot prosthesis;amputee gait improvement;prosthesis size;prosthesis weight;ankle size;ankle weight;instantaneous power output;instantaneous torque output;amputee propulsion;unidirectional spring;force controllable actuator;series elasticity","","70","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed power conversion methodology offers active front-end filtering capability which ensures unity input power factor (reactive power compensation) and low input total harmonic distortion (harmonic power compensation). In addition, this UPS system provides dynamic voltage sag compensation capability, which consequently eliminates any series transformer or dc-dc boost converter that is typically used in conjunction with traditional stand-alone UPS systems. Furthermore, it has the desirable characteristics of making seamless transition from normal to backup mode during power failures and vice versa, as well as providing controlled voltage charging at the dc bus link. The proposed UPS is also impervious to load variations, which enables it to operate under nonlinear load condition. Lastly, the circuit structure is conceived from a commonly used three-leg six-switch building block, thereby making it simple and cost-effective, and offering improved power conversion efficiency as compared to a conventional line-interactive or on-line UPS schemes.

From theoretical analysis, it is shown that MLE is more appropriate than MDS, given the underlying assumption of statistical signal models of the received-signal-strength-based localization problem. We also show that MDS can approximately achieve asymptotic efficiency with appropriate weighting schemes in some scenarios. From extensive simulation results, it is noted that the nonlinear least square algorithms that are commonly used to determine MLE are not as efficient as the iterative MDS algorithms. Thus, we propose a new integrated method MDS-MLE to effectively benefit from the strength of both methods. In the new method, MDS is used as an initialization method for MLE. With the solution of MDS as an initial value, MLE converges much faster and achieves significantly better performance than with random initial values. Superior performance of the new method is clearly demonstrated through simulation results. The effects of the deployment density of sensor nodes and reference nodes (RNs), as well as the deployment structure of RNs, are also studied through various simulations.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2007.904535","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4357112","Collaborative localization;maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE);multidimensional scaling (MDS);received-signal strength (RSS);sensor networks;Collaborative localization;maximum likelihood estimator (MLE);multidimensional scaling (MDS);received signal strength (RSS);sensor networks","Collaboration;Wireless sensor networks;Maximum likelihood estimation;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Multidimensional systems;Signal processing algorithms;Time of arrival estimation;Ultrasonic imaging;Iterative algorithms;Routing","least squares approximations;maximum likelihood estimation;wireless sensor networks","collaborative localization;received-signal strength;wireless sensor networks;multidimensional scaling;maximum-likelihood estimator;statistical signal models;asymptotic efficiency;nonlinear least square algorithms;sensor nodes;reference nodes","","112","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main advantage of this concept is that no miniaturized force sensor has to be integrated into surgical instruments and inserted into the patient. Rather, outside the patient, a standard sensor is attached to a modified trocar, which allows for the undisturbed measurement of manipulation forces. This approach reduces costs and sterilizability demands.

But since the introduction of turbo codes in 1993, much more powerful codes referred to collectively as turbo and turbo-like codes have eclipsed classical methods. These powerful error-correcting techniques achieve excellent error-rate performance that can closely approach Shannon's channel capacity limit. The lure of these large coding gains has resulted in their incorporation into a widening array of telecommunications standards and systems. This paper will briefly characterize turbo and turbo-like codes, examine their implications for physical layer system design, and discuss standards and systems where they are being used. The emphasis will be on telecommunications applications, particularly wireless, though others are mentioned.

In analogy to data mining, the space of meaningful features for image analysis is also quite vast. Recently, the challenges associated with these problem areas have become more tractable through progress made in machine learning and concerted research effort in manual feature design by domain experts. In this paper, we propose a feature mining paradigm for image classification and examine several feature mining strategies. We also derive a principled approach for dealing with features with varying computational demands. Our goal is to alleviate the burden of manual feature design, which is a key problem in computer vision and machine learning. We include an in-depth empirical study on three typical data sets and offer theoretical explanations for the performance of various feature mining strategies.

However, conventional electric motors do not achieve a power density high enough to be considered in airborne applications. Bulk high temperature superconducting (HTS) materials, such as YBCO pellets, have the capacity of trapping magnetic flux thus behaving as permanent magnets. Experimental data show that one single domain YBCO pellets could trap up to 17 T at 29 K, which enables the design of very high power density motors that could be used in aircraft propulsion. We designed a superconducting motor based on an axial flux configuration and composed of six YBCO plates magnetized by a superconducting coil wound on the outside of the motor. The six-pole homopolar machine uses a conventional air-gap resistive armature. Axial-flux configuration allows several rotors and stators to be stacked together and therefore enables the use of one or several conventional permanent magnet rotors to generate minimum safety torque in case of loss of superconductivity. All-electric aircraft are expected to be powered by fuel cells or turbo-generators fed with pure hydrogen cryogenically stored that would provide the motor with a convenient cooling system at 20 K.

This paper presents a circuit configuration to identify an IGBT fault current by means of measuring the induced voltage across the stray inductance between the IGBT Kelvin emitter and power emitter. Upon fault current detection a feedback control is introduced to dynamically control the di/dt of the fault current.

"IT Ontology and Semantic Technology","K. Choi","KAIST, kschoi@kaist.edu","2007 International Conference on Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Engineering","","2007","","","14","15","IT (information technology) ontology is to be used for analyzing the information technology as well as for enhancing it. Semantic technology is compared with the syntactic one. Ontology plays a backbone for meaning-centered reconfiguration of syntactic structure, which is one aspect of semantic technology. The purpose of use of IT ontology will be categorized into two things: to capture the right information and services for user requests, and on the other hand, to give insights for the future IT with their possible paths by interlinking relations on component classes and instances. Consider question-answering based on ontology to improve the performance of QA. Each question type (e.g., 5W1H) will seek its specific relation from the ontology that has already been acquired from the relevant information resources (e.g., Wikipedia or news articles). The question is whether such relations and related classes are so neutral independent of domain or they are affected by each specific-domain. The first step of ontology learning for question-answering application is to find such neutral relation discovery mechanism and to take care of the special distorted relation-instance mapping when populating on the domain resources. Then, we will consider the domain ontology acquisition by top-down manner from already made similar resources (e.g., domain-specific thesaurus) and also bottom-up manner from the relevant resources. But the already-made resources should be checked against the current available resources for their coverage. Problem is that thesaurus is comprised of classes, not the instances of terms that appear in corpora. They have little coverage over the resources, and even the mapping between classes and instances has not been established yet in this stage. Clustering technology could now filter out the irrelevant mappings. Features of clustering could be improved more accurate by using more semantic ones that have been accumulated during the steps. For example, discovery process based on patterns could be evolved by putting the discovered semantic features into the patterns. Keeping ontology use for question-answering in mind, it is asked for how much the acquired ontology can represent the resources used for acquisition processes. Derived questions are summarized into two about: (1) how such ideal complete ontology could be generated for each specification of use, and (2) how much ontology contributes to the intended problem-solving. The ideal case is to convert all of resources to their corresponding ontology. But if presupposing the gap between the meaning of resources and acquired ontology, a set of raw chunks in resources may be still effective to answer for given questions with some help from acquired ontology or even without resort to them. Definitions of classes and relations in ontology would be manifested through dual structure to supplement the complementary factors between the idealized complete noise-free ontology shape and incomplete error-prone knowledge. In the result, we now confront two problems: how to measure the ontology effectiveness for each situation, and how to compare with the use of ontology for each application and to transform into another shape of ontology depending on application, that could be helped by granularity control and even extended to reconfiguration of knowledge structure. In the result, the intended IT ontology is modularized enough to be compromised later for each purpose of use, and in efficient and effective ways. Still we have to solve definition questions and their translation to ontology forms.","","978-1-4244-1610-3","10.1109/NLPKE.2007.4368004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4368004","","Ontologies;Information technology;Thesauri;Shape measurement;Shape control;Information analysis;Spine;Information resources;Wikipedia;Filters","data mining;information filtering;learning (artificial intelligence);ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;problem solving;thesauri","IT ontology learning;semantic technology;information technology infrastructure;question answering application;information resources;neutral relation discovery mechanism;relation-instance mapping;domain ontology acquisition;domain-specific thesaurus;clustering technology;pattern semantic feature discovery;problem solving","","2","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"A survey of QoS routing solutions for mobile ad hoc networks","L. Hanzo; R. Tafazolli","NA; NA","IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","","2007","9","2","50","70","In mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), the provision of quality of service (QoS) guarantees is much more challenging than in wireline networks, mainly due to node mobility, multihop communications, contention for channel access, and a lack of central coordination. QoS guarantees are required by most multimedia and other time- or error-sensitive applications. The difficulties in the provision of such guarantees have limited the usefulness of MANETs. However, in the last decade, much research attention has focused on providing QoS assurances in MANET protocols. The QoS routing protocol is an integral part of any QoS solution since its function is to ascertain which nodes, if any, are able to serve applications‚ requirements. Consequently, it also plays a crucial role in data session admission control. This document offers an up-to-date survey of most major contributions to the pool of QoS routing solutions for MANETs published in the period 1997-2006. We include a thorough overview of QoS routing metrics, resources, and factors affecting performance and classify the protocols found in the literature. We also summarize their operation and describe their interactions with the medium access control (MAC) protocol, where applicable. This provides the reader with insight into their differences and allows us to highlight trends in protocol design and identify areas for future research.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2007.382407","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4267832","","Mobile ad hoc networks;Quality of service;Routing protocols;Access protocols;Media Access Protocol;Spread spectrum communication;Mobile communication;Admission control;Throughput","","","","153","","57","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This technique utilizes an odd mode signal to generate fringing fields on either side of a microstrip gap under the antenna. This allows electromagnetic energy to be efficiently coupled from the transmission lines to the radiating antenna. In a balanced integrated antenna amplifier configuration, the proposed non-contact feeding method removes the need for any balun or power combining network. Hence in theory, a compact RF front-end design with lower losses can be realized. This feeding method has been successfully applied to the design of simple passive microstrip patch antennas and active integrated antennas (AIA). Simulated and measured results are also included to validate the proposed feeding concept and antenna designs. The performance of the proposed differential feeding technique on a simple microstrip patch antenna has been systematically studied.

"Kernel-Based Least Squares Policy Iteration for Reinforcement Learning","X. Xu; D. Hu; X. Lu","Nat. Univ. of Defense Technol., Changsha; Nat. Univ. of Defense Technol., Changsha; Nat. Univ. of Defense Technol., Changsha","IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","","2007","18","4","973","992","In this paper, we present a kernel-based least squares policy iteration (KLSPI) algorithm for reinforcement learning (RL) in large or continuous state spaces, which can be used to realize adaptive feedback control of uncertain dynamic systems. By using KLSPI, near-optimal control policies can be obtained without much a priori knowledge on dynamic models of control plants. In KLSPI, Mercer kernels are used in the policy evaluation of a policy iteration process, where a new kernel-based least squares temporal-difference algorithm called KLSTD-Q is proposed for efficient policy evaluation. To keep the sparsity and improve the generalization ability of KLSTD-Q solutions, a kernel sparsification procedure based on approximate linear dependency (ALD) is performed. Compared to the previous works on approximate RL methods, KLSPI makes two progresses to eliminate the main difficulties of existing results. One is the better convergence and (near) optimality guarantee by using the KLSTD-Q algorithm for policy evaluation with high precision. The other is the automatic feature selection using the ALD-based kernel sparsification. Therefore, the KLSPI algorithm provides a general RL method with generalization performance and convergence guarantee for large-scale Markov decision problems (MDPs). Experimental results on a typical RL task for a stochastic chain problem demonstrate that KLSPI can consistently achieve better learning efficiency and policy quality than the previous least squares policy iteration (LSPI) algorithm. Furthermore, the KLSPI method was also evaluated on two nonlinear feedback control problems, including a ship heading control problem and the swing up control of a double-link underactuated pendulum called acrobot. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed method can optimize controller performance using little a priori information of uncertain dynamic systems. It is also demonstrated that KLSPI can be applied to online learning control by incorporating an initial controller to ensure online performance.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2007.899161","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4267723","Approximate dynamic programming;kernel methods;least squares;Markov decision problems (MDPs);reinforcement learning (RL)","Least squares methods;Learning;Kernel;Feedback control;Least squares approximation;State-space methods;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Linear approximation;Convergence","adaptive control;feedback;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);least squares approximations;Markov processes;nonlinear control systems;optimal control;state-space methods;uncertain systems","kernel-based least squares policy iteration;reinforcement learning;continuous state spaces;adaptive feedback control;uncertain dynamic systems;near-optimal control policy;control plants;Mercer kernels;policy evaluation;kernel-based least squares temporal-difference algorithm;generalization ability;kernel sparsification procedure;approximate linear dependency;large-scale Markov decision problems;stochastic chain problem;least squares policy iteration algorithm;nonlinear feedback control;ship heading control problem;swing up control;double-link underactuated pendulum;acrobot;online learning control","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biomimetics;Computer Simulation;Decision Support Techniques;Feedback;Least-Squares Analysis;Markov Chains;Models, Theoretical;Reinforcement (Psychology)","141","","47","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To reduce the induced no-load losses due to the high rotational speed of the flywheel, the slots in the stator are made not of iron but of a nonmagnetic plastic material. This results in an air gap winding with a stator yoke consisting of stacked circular laminations. The analytical model includes the effect of the winding distribution on the field, the fact that it is in the air gap, and the effect of the eddy-current reaction field of the shielding cylinder. The two-dimensional magnetic field is solved in six defined machine layers and useful machine quantities are derived directly from it, leading to the machine voltage equation.

Moreover, we discuss that the proposed codes can provide unequal recovery time (URT). This means that given a target bit error rate, different parts of information bits can be decoded after receiving different amounts of encoded bits. This implies that the information bits can be recovered in a progressive manner. This URT property may be used for sequential data recovery in video/audio streaming","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2007.892814","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4137897","Asymptotic analysis;finite-length analysis;iterative decoding;lossy channels;maximum-likelihood decoding;rateless codes;unequal error protection","Error correction codes;Iterative decoding;Maximum likelihood decoding;Application software;Streaming media;Protection;Maximum likelihood estimation;Automatic repeat request;Error probability;Bit error rate","error statistics;iterative decoding;maximum likelihood decoding","rateless codes;unequal error protection;UEP;iterative decoding;maximum-likelihood decoding;error probability;Raptor codes;unequal recovery time;URT;bit error rate;video-audio streaming","","179","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To facilitate low-voltage operation with 0.8-1.2-V supply, the mixer employs a folded Gilbert cell topology with PMOS devices for LO switches and utilizes on-chip broadband RF chokes for biasing. The folded toplogy allows the transconductance and LO stages to have different bias current. By setting the bias current in the PMOS switches near zero, the mixer DC offset due to device mismatch is greatly reduced The effect of supply voltage on the mixer performance is studied. The mixer consumes 2.5 and 5.8 mW from a 0.8-V and 1.2-V supply, respectively. Under a 1.2-V supply, the mixer achieves a voltage conversion gain (CG) of 5.3-8.2 dB, a single-sideband noise figure (NF) of 9.6-13.5dB, a second-order intermodualtion intercept point (IIP2) of 37.3-43.4dBm, and a third-order intermodualtion intercept point (IIP3) of -3.2 to -0.3 dBm between 3-7 GHz.

From this point of view, it is shown that GmC integrators are preferred over RC integrators in the low-pass filter of the modulator because they show a better tradeoff between power, speed, and accuracy. A new single-bit quantizer topology is presented that incorporates a local feedback path that improves stability using a switched-voltage technique.

This antenna is a demonstration model for the next generation titan cloud precipitation radar and altimeter (TCPRA) and is intended to enhance the capability of the future cloud and precipitation remote sensing system for Earth and other planets. The reflectarray has a dimension of 0.5-m square and a flat aperture that emulates a cylindrical reflector antenna. Two sets of linear arrays with linearly polarized microstrip elements and having low cross polarization and low sidelobe levels (SLL) are placed along the focal line to illuminate the reflectarray. One set is for Ku-band, while the other is for Ka-band. Within each set, the wide-swath scanning capability of the antenna is provided by the two fixed-beam feed arrays with one for broadside beam and the other one for a 20deg tilted beam. The unique feature of this paper is that this is the first offset-fed reflectarray that has ever been practically developed to emulate a cylindrical/parabolic type of reflector antenna. In addition, new dual-concentric-ring elements and ring-patch elements are uniquely applied here to achieve the desirable wide phase variation characteristics. Tests of feed arrays and the reflectarray in the anechoic chamber of Texas A&M University result in good pattern performance and the successful demonstration of beam scanning at both frequency bands.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2007.908841","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4380556","Antenna array feeds;beam steering;cylindrical reflector;reflectarray antenna","Microstrip antenna arrays;Linear antenna arrays;Reflector antennas;Microstrip antennas;Radar antennas;Clouds;Polarization;Feeds;Biomembranes;Radar remote sensing","altimeters;meteorological radar;microstrip antenna arrays;multifrequency antennas;planetary remote sensing;reflector antenna feeds","offset linear-array-fed Ku/Ka dual-band microstrip reflectarray antenna;planet cloud-precipitation radar;thin membrane;altimeter;remote sensing system;cylindrical reflector antenna;dual-concentric-ring element","","35","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This method is validated by comparing theoretical and experimental results for 19 different slot width, slot length and dielectric constant combinations. The average difference is about 2%.

Some of the potential advantages are improved aerodynamics, increased payload, large field of view (LFOV) and low observability (LO). However, the usage of conformal array technology in commercial applications is still comparably rare. Recent examples of antenna arrays on curved apertures are typically of cylindrical shape but only exhibit a weak degree of curvature. The present paper describes the development of a spherical antenna array with 95x3 antenna elements, a diameter of 300 mm and an opening angle of 112deg . Since the number of antenna elements on a planar or curved antenna aperture required for high directivity and two-dimensional beam steering can easily become very large, especially if an element spacing around half the free space wave length is required, the antenna elements are arranged in sub-arrays, each carrying 3 circularly polarized patch antennas at a centre frequency of f = 9.5 GHz and a phase corrected feed network on a common substrate. The sub-array is suited for easy integration into antenna arrays with double curved aperture and can be seen as a trade-off between antenna gain vs. beam granularity. Experimental results on antenna matching and radiated far field patterns as well as measured beam forming results will be presented.","","978-3-00-021644-2","10.1109/INICA.2007.4353945","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4353945","conformal antennas;antenna arrays;microstrip patch antennas","Antenna arrays;Aperture antennas;Antenna feeds;Reflector antennas;Aircraft;Marine vehicles;Planar arrays;Aerodynamics;Payloads;Observability","antenna arrays;antenna feeds;aperture antennas;beam steering;conformal antennas;microstrip antenna arrays;microstrip antennas;planar antenna arrays","spherical antenna array;conformal array demonstrator;antenna elements;planar antenna aperture;curved antenna aperture;2D beam steering;element spacing;circularly polarized patch antennas;phase corrected feed network;antenna matching;size 300 mm;frequency 9.5 GHz","","10","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The most well-known fairness criterion (max-min fairness) gives priority to the minimum-rate session. Kelly questioned its appropriateness in his works on the bandwidth sharing among the end-to-end flows and proposed another fairness criterion preferring short-distance flows to enhance the overall throughput, which is called the proportional fairness (PF). A simple scheduler achieving this objective was introduced in wireless access networks and revealed that it can achieve a good compromise between cell throughput and user fairness.

A predominant approach to collaborative filtering is neighborhood based (""k-nearest neighbors""), where a user-item preference rating is interpolated from ratings of similar items and/or users. We enhance the neighborhood-based approach leading to substantial improvement of prediction accuracy, without a meaningful increase in running time. First, we remove certain so-called ""global effects"" from the data to make the ratings more comparable, thereby improving interpolation accuracy. Second, we show how to simultaneously derive interpolation weights for all nearest neighbors, unlike previous approaches where each weight is computed separately. By globally solving a suitable optimization problem, this simultaneous interpolation accounts for the many interactions between neighbors leading to improved accuracy. Our method is very fast in practice, generating a prediction in about 0.2 milliseconds. Importantly, it does not require training many parameters or a lengthy preprocessing, making it very practical for large scale applications. Finally, we show how to apply these methods to the perceivably much slower user-oriented approach. To this end, we suggest a novel scheme for low dimensional embedding of the users. We evaluate these methods on the netflix dataset, where they deliver significantly better results than the commercial netflix cinematch recommender system.","2374-8486","978-0-7695-3018-5","10.1109/ICDM.2007.90","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4470228","","Filtering;Interpolation;Recommender systems;International collaboration;Nearest neighbor searches;Motion pictures;Data mining;Accuracy;Large-scale systems;Demography","information filters;interpolation","scalable collaborative filtering;Netflix Cinematch recommender system;interpolation weights","","181","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose an improved version of the fast marching method (FMM) that is highly accurate for both 2D and 3D Cartesian domains. The new method is called multistencils fast marching (MSFM), which computes the solution at each grid point by solving the Eikonal equation along several stencils and then picks the solution that satisfies the upwind condition. The stencils are centered at each grid point and cover its entire nearest neighbors. In 2D space, two stencils cover 8-neighbors of the point, whereas in 3D space, six stencils cover its 26-neighbors. For those stencils that are not aligned with the natural coordinate system, the Eikonal equation is derived using directional derivatives and then solved using higher order finite difference schemes. The accuracy of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art FMM-based techniques has been demonstrated through comprehensive numerical experiments.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1154","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4288158","Multi-stencils fast marching methods;monotonically advancing fronts;fast marching methods;level set methods;Eikonal equation","Computer vision;Level set;Nonlinear equations;Grid computing;Tracking;Application software;Partial differential equations;Shape;Path planning;Iterative algorithms","computational geometry;computer vision;finite difference methods;hyperbolic equations;partial differential equations","multistencils fast marching method;Eikonal equation;computer vision application;Hamilton-Jacobi equation;finite difference scheme;2D Cartesian domain;3D Cartesian domain;first-order hyperbolic partial differential equation","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","155","","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For the first time, these devices have been electrically cascaded to yield high performance, low insertion loss (as low as 4 dB at 93MHz), and large rejection (27 dB at 236 MHz) micromechanical bandpass filters. This novel technology could revolutionize wireless communication systems by allowing cofabrication of multiple frequency filters on the same chip, potentially reducing form factors and manufacturing costs.

Moreover, when handing an object to the robot, subjects control the object's position and orientation to match the configuration of the robot's hand, thereby simplifying robotic grasping and offering opportunities to simplify the manipulation task. Second, we present a robotic application that relies on this form of human-robot interaction. This application enables a humanoid robot to help a user place objects on a shelf, perform bimanual insertion tasks, and hold a box within which the user can place objects.

Nonlinear loads, with harmonic currents close to the DVR filter resonance frequency, can also excite the resonance oscillations. To compensate voltage sags and dampen high-frequency oscillations simultaneously, an investigation of the transient response of DVR is first carried out. Possible control schemes and their effects on the oscillation attenuation are also studied. Such studied control schemes include the commonly used single voltage loop control, voltage feedback plus reference feedforward control, and double-loop control with an outer voltage loop and an inner current loop. Subsequently, an effective and simple resonance damping method is proposed by employing a closed-loop control with an embedded two-step Posicast controller. The proposed control methods have been extensively tested on a 10-kV DVR system. It is shown that the proposed damping methods improve both the transient and steady-state performance of the DVR.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2007.904430","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4305325","Double-loop control;dynamic voltage restorer (DVR);Posicast control;resonance attenuation;resonant controller;transient oscillation","Transient response;Medium voltage;Voltage control;Damping;Resonance;Voltage fluctuations;Power harmonic filters;Resonant frequency;Power quality;Attenuation","distribution networks;energy storage;invertors;power supply quality;power transformers;transient response","Posicast control;resonance damping method;reference feedforward control;voltage feedback;single voltage loop control;voltage sags;harmonic currents;nonlinear loads;transient oscillations;dynamic voltage restorer;medium voltage level;transient response","","66","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, encryption techniques do not take into account wireless network characteristics such as random bit errors due to noise and burst errors due to fading. We note that the avalanche effect that makes a block cipher secure also causes them to be sensitive to bit errors. This results in a fundamental trade-off between security and throughput in encryption based wireless security.1 Further, if there is an adversary with a certain attack strength present in the wireless network, we see an additional twist to the security-throughput trade-off issue. In this paper, we propose a framework called opportunistic encryption that uses channel opportunities (acceptable signal to noise ratio) to maximize the throughput subject to desired security constraints. To illustrate this framework and compare it with some current approaches, this paper presents the following: 1) mathematical models to capture the security-throughput trade-off, 2) adversary models and their effects, 3) joint optimization of encryption and modulation (single and multirate), 4) the use of forward error correcting (FEC) codes to protect encrypted packets from bit errors, and 5) simulation results for Rijndael cipher.

The use of commodity and embedded flash memories is growing rapidly as we enter the system-on-chip era. Conventional tests for flash memories are usually ad hoc-the test procedure is developed for a specific design. As there is a large number of possible failure modes for flash memories, long test algorithms on complicated automatic test equipment (ATE) are commonly seen. The long test time results in high test cost. We propose a systematic approach in testing flash memories, including the development of March-like test algorithms, cost-effective fault diagnosis methodology, and built-in self-test (BIST) scheme. The improved March-like test algorithms can detect disturb faults-derived from the IEEE STD 1005-and conventional faults. As the memory array architecture and/or cell structure varies, the targeted fault set may change. We have developed a flash-memory fault simulator called RAMSES-FT, with which we can easily analyze and verify the coverage of targeted faults under any given test algorithm. In addition, the RAM test algorithm generator-test algorithm generator by simulation-has been enhanced based on RAMSES-FT, so that one can easily generate tests for flash memories, whether they are bit- or word-oriented.

The method combines a micro electrothermal test structure with a finite-element- based data analysis procedure. The test device consists of two serpentine nickel structures, which serve as resistive heaters and resistance temperature detectors, on top of the sample. The sample is supported by a silicon nitride membrane. Analytical solution of the heat flow is infeasible, making interpretation of the data difficult. To address this, we use a finite-element model of the test structure and apply nonlinear least-squares estimation to extract the desired material parameter values. The approach permits simultaneous extraction of multiple parameters. We demonstrate our technique by simultaneously obtaining the thermal conductivity of a 280 mum x 80 mum x 140 nm thick aluminum sample and the 360 mum x 160 mum x 180 nm thick silicon nitride support membrane. The thermal conductivity measured for the silicon nitride thin film is 2.1 W/mK, which is in agreement with reported values for films of this thickness. The thermal conductivity of the Al thin film is found to be 94 W/mK, which is significantly lower than reported bulk values and consistent both with reported trends for thin metallic films and with values that were obtained using electrical resistivity measurements and the Wiedemann-Franz law.","1941-0158","","10.1109/JMEMS.2007.900877","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4337808","Measurement;microthermal devices;thermal conductivity;thermal variables measurement;thin films","Transistors;Thermal conductivity;Conductivity measurement;Testing;Finite element methods;Data analysis;Conductive films;Silicon;Thickness measurement;Biomembranes","aluminium;finite element analysis;least squares approximations;membranes;metallic thin films;micromechanical devices;resistance thermometers;thermal conductivity measurement","thin-film thermal conductivity measurement;micro electrothermal test structures;finite-element-model-based data analysis;nanoscale thickness;serpentine nickel structures;resistive heaters;resistance temperature detectors;silicon nitride membrane;heat flow;nonlinear least-squares estimation;size 280 mum;size 80 mum;size 140 nm;size 360 mum;size 160 mum;size 180 nm;Al - Element;SiN - Binary","","50","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Inspecting the sewage pipes using the state of the arts inspection methods by the current robots is costly, mostly human cost, and not fast enough to check and inspect the amount of sewage pipes will grow stronger than it has actually happened, specially in Japan.

This paper formulates and analyzes the dc-capacitor-voltage-drift phenomenon of a passive front-end five-level DCC, which operates based on a sinusoidal pulsewidth-modulation (SPWM) switching strategy. The analysis shows dependence of the voltage drift on the modulation index and the ac-side power factor of the DCC. The analysis concludes that an SPWM strategy, without the use of auxiliary power circuitry, is not able to prevent the voltage-drift phenomenon of a five-level DCC. This paper also proposes a space-vector-modulation (SVM)-based switching strategy that takes advantage of redundant switching vectors of the SVM method to counteract the voltage-drift phenomenon. The limit to the range of operation of a five-level DCC, which is based on the proposed SVM strategy, is also presented. The salient feature of the proposed strategy is that it enables voltage balancing of the dc capacitors with no requirements for additional controls or auxiliary-power circuitry, within the specified range of operation. The performance of a DCC under various operating conditions, based on time-domain simulation studies in the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment, is evaluated.

"Challenges in Antenna Designs and Some Novel Techniques for Meeting Them","R. Mittra","Electromagnetic Communication Laboratory, Penn State University. E-mail: rajmittra@ieee.org","2007 Loughborough Antennas and Propagation Conference","","2007","","","1","4","In this paper we identify some challenges in antenna designs-both small and large types-that we have recently encountered in the process of designing antennas for personal communication, GPS, UWB, Millimeter waves, BANs (body area networks), sensors, RFID, and other similar applications. The primary challenges in designing small antennas arise from the specifications that are often very demanding in terms of performance expectations, e.g., gain, bandwidth, pattern characteristics (including polarization), decreased sensitivity to the environment, etc., even as the above specs concurrently place severe restrictions on the size of the available real estate in which the antenna is to be placed. We should mention that even though the antenna itself may be small, the degrees of freedom (DOFs) associated with the problem description can still be large, especially when dealing with antenna/metamaterial composites, which often pose a considerable challenge when one attempts to simulate them. Needless to say that the topic of metamaterial has attracted considerable attention in recent years, as evidenced by the number of researcher contributing to the subject, who have been very prolific indeed. It would be presumptive to attempt to fully cover and renew these developments in this presentation-given the time limitation-because it would be impossible to do justice to the diverse away of facets that have all been grouped under the general umbrella of ""Metamaterials."" In view of this, we narrow our focus down to the topic of ""Performance Enhancement of Small Antennas using Metamaterials,"" because such enhancements are certain to have a very large impact on communication antenna design, which, we believe to be a centerpiece topic of this conference. The first impression that comes to one's mind when one scans through and takes a cursory look at the vast array of publications that discuss antenna-material composites is that the metamaterials provide the proverbial ""Midas touch,"" a veritable magic bullet for curing everything that ails the small antennas. If we were to compile a wish-list for the desired features of small antennas, we would most probably include: wide bandwidth in terms of both impedance match (return loss) and radiation pattern, high directivity, and conformal nature-to name just a few of the desirable attributes of the antennas that we might be designing for communication, RFID, GPS, LAN or BAN applications. Some of the small antenna/metamaterial composite type of configurations to be discussed in the presentation are shown in Figs. 1 through 5. For large antennas, the design goals are often very different, and the emphasis here may be to realize ultra-low sidelobes, reduce EMI, achieve superior EMC characteristics, etc., just to name a few. Here, the challenge often is how to model these large structures in an accurate and efficient manner so that their performance can be predicted reliably and confidently, before the antenna is actually fabricated-the motto being ""Correct by Design,"" or CBD. Commercial softwares are often quite limited in their ability to handle the structures which require a problem description with a very large number of DOFs that could reach-or exceed- 109 unknowns, because of their complexity, multi-scale characteristics and inhomogeneous nature. With the advent of powerful computers such as the IBM/BlueGene (see Fig.6), it is now possible to solve problems of this magnitude accurately and efficiently. Illustrative examples of antenna configurations that fall in this category are: Array feeds for the Square Kilometer Array (SKA); coupling between two Phased arrays mounted on a large platform, e.g., the topside of a ship; and, the design of large doubly-curved subreflectors, comprised of multilayer FSS screens, for frequency reuse applications. A few of these representative large antenna problems are shown in Figs. 7 through 10, and would be discussed in the presentation.","","1-4244-0775-3","10.1109/LAPC.2007.367420","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4218455","","Metamaterials;Phased arrays;Antenna arrays;Radiofrequency identification;Ultra wideband antennas;Global Positioning System;Bandwidth;Process design;Millimeter wave communication;Millimeter wave technology","antenna phased arrays;antenna radiation patterns;Global Positioning System;metamaterials;personal communication networks;radiofrequency identification;ultra wideband antennas","personal communication;ultra wideband antennas;body area networks;radiofrequency identification;GPS;performance expectations;degrees of freedom;metamaterial composites;Midas touch;small antennas;impedance match;radiation pattern;correct by design;array feeds;square kilometer array;phased arrays","","2","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given a target and possible obstacle locations, the computer calculates the flexible needle-tip trajectory that avoids the obstacle and hits the target. Using an inverse kinematics algorithm, the needle base maneuvers required for a tip to follow this trajectory are calculated, enabling a robot to perform controlled needle insertion. Assuming small displacements, the flexible needle is modeled as a linear beam supported by virtual springs, where the stiffness coefficients of the springs can vary along the needle. Using this simplified model, the forward and inverse kinematics of the needle are solved analytically, enabling both path planning and path correction in real time. The needle shape is detected in real time from fluoroscopic images, and the controller commands the needle base motion that minimizes the needle tip error. This approach was verified experimentally using a robot to maneuver the base of a flexible needle inserted into a muscle tissue. Along the 40-mm trajectory that avoids the obstacle and hits the target, the error stayed below the 0.5-mm level. This study demonstrates the ability to perform closed-loop control and steering of a flexible needle by maneuvering the needle base so that its tip achieves a planned trajectory.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2007.898972","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4252165","Biomedical imaging;flexible structures;medical treatment;robots","Needles;Trajectory;Kinematics;Springs;Shape control;Real time systems;Biological tissues;Robot control;Path planning;Motion detection","closed loop systems;collision avoidance;fluorescence;medical image processing;medical robotics;robot vision","image-guided robotic;flexible needle steering;real-time fluoroscopic guidance;obstacle locations;inverse kinematics;needle insertion;muscle tissue;closed-loop control","","169","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The degradation includes the impedance mismatching, the increased side-lobe level, the deviation of the radiation pattern from the desired one, and the decrease of gain due to the excitation of the surface wave. In the application of continuous wave radar, when the transmitting antenna and the receiving antenna are placed closely side by side, the transmitting energy may even blockade the receiver. In the application of adaptive nulling arrays, the mutual coupling will result in the serious degradation of the adaptive nulling performance. The mutual coupling is also important to the issues of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) when a lot of RF systems work simultaneously in a limited space, especially to the signal integrality (SI) design. The mechanism of the mutual coupling is quite complicated which involves both the near field and the far field couplings. In dealing with these problems, the full wave analysis is indispensable. In the meantime, in the analysis or optimization design, the frequency response should be taken into account as well. In this paper, the effective frequency dependent full wave analysis will be introduced. Examples of mutual coupling reduction are given that involve the mutual coupling reduction between two microstrip antenna arrays and the mutual coupling reduction between microstrip antenna elements,. In addition, the mutual coupling effect on the performances of some antenna arrays will be briefly addressed.","2158-1118","978-1-4244-1371-3","10.1109/ELMAGC.2007.4413419","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4413419","Microstrip patch antenna;antenna array;mutual coupling;adaptive nulling;active reflection coefficient","Microstrip antenna arrays;Microstrip antennas;Mutual coupling;Antenna accessories;Degradation;Radar antennas;Radio frequency;Microstrip components;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas","CW radar;electromagnetic compatibility;electromagnetic coupling;frequency response;microstrip antenna arrays;radar antennas","finite microstrip antenna array;mutual coupling;radiation frequency component;continuous wave radar;transmitting antenna;receiving antenna;adaptive nulling;electromagnetic compatibility;full wave analysis;frequency response","","10","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Wisconsin-Madison, Madison; NA; NA","IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","","2007","25","7","1298","1310","The full diversity gain provided by a multi-antenna channel can be achieved by transmit beamforming and receive combining. This requires the knowledge of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter which is difficult to obtain in practice. Quantized beamforming where fixed codebooks known at both the transmitter and the receiver are used to quantize the CSI has been proposed to solve this problem. Most recent works focus attention on limited feedback codebook design for the uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channel. Such designs are sub-optimal when used in correlated channels. In this paper, we propose systematic codebook design for correlated channels when channel statistical information is known at the transmitter. This design is motivated by studying the performance of pure statistical beamforming in correlated channels and is implemented by maps that can rotate and scale spherical caps on the Grassmannian manifold. Based on this study, we show that even statistical beamforming is near-optimal if the transmitter covariance matrix is ill-conditioned and receiver covariance matrix is well-conditioned. This leads to a partitioning of the transmit and receive covariance spaces based on their conditioning with variable feedback requirements to achieve an operational performance level in the different partitions. When channel statistics are difficult to obtain at the transmitter, we propose a universal codebook design (also implemented by the rotation-scaling maps) that is robust to channel statistics. Numerical studies show that even few bits of feedback, when applied with our designs, lead to near perfect CSI performance in a variety of correlated channel conditions.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2007.070804","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4299601","","Array signal processing;MIMO;Transmitters;Feedback;Covariance matrix;Statistics;Diversity methods;Diversity reception;Channel state information;Fading","antenna arrays;array signal processing;correlation methods;covariance matrices;diversity reception;MIMO communication;quantisation (signal);Rayleigh channels;statistical analysis","quantization;rotation-scaling maps;receiver covariance matrix;transmitter covariance matrix;Grassmannian line packing;statistical beamforming;channel statistical information;uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channel;feedback codebook design;channel state information;receive combining;transmit beamforming;multiantenna channel;full diversity gain;correlated MIMO channels;quantized beamforming;systematic codebook designs","","186","","39","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

LBP can work robustly with respective to light variation on rich texture regions but not so efficiently on uniform regions. In the latter case, color information should overcome LBP's limitation. Due to the illumination invariance of both the LBP feature and the selected color feature, the method is able to handle local illumination changes such as cast shadows from moving objects. Due to the use of a simple layer-based strategy, the approach can model moving background pixels with quasi-periodic flickering as well as background scenes which may vary over time due to the addition and removal of long-time stationary objects. Finally, the use of a cross-bilateral filter allows to implicitly smooth detection results over regions of similar intensity and preserve object boundaries.

As a light-weight automated diagnosis technique it can easily be integrated with existing testing schemes. However, as no model of the system is taken into account, its diagnostic accuracy is inherently limited. Using the Siemens Set benchmark, we investigate this diagnostic accuracy as a function of several parameters (such as quality and quantity of the program spectra collected during the execution of the system), some of which directly relate to test design. Our results indicate that the superior performance of a particular similarity coefficient, used to analyze the program spectra, is largely independent of test design. Furthermore, near- optimal diagnostic accuracy (exonerating about 80% of the blocks of code on average) is already obtained for low-quality error observations and limited numbers of test cases. The influence of the number of test cases is of primary importance for continuous (embedded) processing applications, where only limited observation horizons can be maintained.","","978-0-7695-2984-4","10.1109/TAIC.PART.2007.13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4344104","","Software testing;Automatic testing;Fault diagnosis;Debugging;Computer industry;Benchmark testing;Failure analysis;Fault detection;Fault location;Mathematics","program debugging;program diagnostics;program testing","spectrum-based fault localization;test-diagnose-repair cycle;light-weight automated diagnosis technique;low-quality error observations;test data analysis","","243","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, these nominal model parameters are actively designed to achieve the phase compensation. This paper proposes the design method of observer to achieve phase compensation based on disturbance observer. Compared with implementing phase compensator, the control system is simple and easy to design. The selection of these parameters has some restriction. When the nominal model parameters are much separated from the actual ones, the stability of the control system deteriorates.

Interestingly, this receiver requires prior knowledge of the clutter covariance, but the detection threshold is functionally independent thereof. At the transmitter design stage, we give two criteria for code construction: the first is based on the classical Chernoff bound, the second is an information-theoretic criterion. Interestingly, the two criteria lead to the same condition for code optimality, which in turn specializes, under the assumption of uncorrelated clutter and square code matrix, in some well-known full-rate space-time codes.

This movement has led to major changes in supply chain practices based partly on imitation of successful keiretsu models in Japan and a move toward modules. This study finds significant impact of modularity on outsourcing, product development, and supply chain coordination based on interviews conducted with automakers and suppliers from 2000-2003. Based on our interviews, we observe that modularity has accompanied a major reorganization of the automotive supplier industry. We identify two major issues that appear to block U.S. automakers from gaining most of the advantages possible through modularity. First, most modularity activities appear to be primarily strategically cost reduction driven, leaving the potential of modularity for mass customization largely untapped. Second, the shift in industry reorganization has not been accompanied by changes in the supply chain infrastructure to encourage long-term partnerships.

Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes are the best known ECC codes that can achieve data rates very close to the Shannon limit. In addition, superior error correction performance and parallelizable decoding algorithms have made LDPC codes a powerful competitor to turbo codes for reliable high speed communication applications. Recently, Cognitive Radio (CR) has been proposed as a promising technology to solve today's spectrum scarcity problem. CR promises to alleviate this spectrum shortage problem by dynamically accessing free spectrum resources. This implies that the radio has to work in multi-band, cope with various wireless channels and support various services such as voice, data and video. The basic requirement for CR is that it has a reconfigurable architecture to support multi-band and frequency adaptive operations. One of the ambitious design goals of future wireless systems, including 4G, IEEE 802.11n/802.16 standards, is to provide reliably very high data rate transmission in hostile environments: for example, around 100 Mb/s peak rate for downlink and around 30 Mb/s sum rate for uplink transmission with a low frame error rate (FER), typically less than 5 times10-4. To ensure reliable nd error-free communication, there is a demand to consider implementing LDPC decoders in CR and frequency agile environments.

Cree has demonstrated power densities higher than 25 watts per mm of gate periphery. With ftau's > 40 GHz, GaN devices have the capability of satisfying system device requirements from UHF through millimeter-wave. Both technologies are now also offered through commercial MMIC foundry services using design rules and non-linear models provided for external designers. Significant progress has also been made in the development of 100-mm SiC substrates and WBG epitaxy (SiC and GaN) which is key for commercializing the technology and providing low costs. Micropipe densities as low as 2.5 cm-2 have been demonstrated for 100-mm HPSI substrates and both SiC and GaN epitaxy with excellent intra-wafer sheet resistance uniformity have been demonstrated. With robust reliability for SiC MESFETs now established for several years, the latest results for GaN device reliability benchmarking are shown.","2375-5318","1-4244-0283-2","10.1109/RADAR.2007.374395","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4250443","","Silicon carbide;Gallium nitride;Photonic band gap;MESFETs;Millimeter wave technology;Substrates;Epitaxial growth;Packaging;MMICs;Foundries","gallium compounds;high electron mobility transistors;III-V semiconductors;millimetre wave devices;Schottky gate field effect transistors;semiconductor device reliability;semiconductor epitaxial layers;silicon compounds;UHF devices;wide band gap semiconductors","wide bandgap device;MESFET;UHF device;millimeter-wave device;commercial MMIC foundry services;design rules;nonlinear models;wide band gap epitaxy;HPSI substrates;intra-wafer sheet resistance uniformity;robust device reliability;SiC;GaN","","25","","2","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a novel template matching algorithm, called algebraic template matching. Given a template and an input image, algebraic template matching efficiently calculates similarities between the template and the partial images of the input image, for various widths and heights. The partial image most similar to the template image is detected from the input image for any location, width, and height. In the proposed algorithm, a polynomial that approximates the template image is used to match the input image instead of the template image. The proposed algorithm is effective especially when the width and height of the template image differ from the partial image to be matched. An algorithm using the Legendre polynomial is proposed for efficient approximation of the template image. This algorithm not only reduces computational costs, but also improves the quality of the approximated image. It is shown theoretically and experimentally that the computational cost of the proposed algorithm is much smaller than the existing methods.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2007.901243","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4271537","Algebraic template matching;image processing;object detection;polynomial;template matching","Polynomials;Signal processing algorithms;Computational efficiency;Image processing;Object detection;Fourier transforms;Impedance matching;Approximation algorithms;Signal processing;Image retrieval","cost reduction;image matching;polynomial approximation","image processing;signal processing;algebraic template matching;Legendre polynomial algorithm;computational cost reduction","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique","41","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In a previous paper, we present a selection process to deal with group decision making problems with incomplete fuzzy preference relations, which uses consistency measures to estimate the incomplete fuzzy preference relations. In this paper we present a consensus model. The main novelty of this consensus model is that of being guided by both consensus and consistency measures. Also, the consensus reaching process is guided automatically, without moderator, through both consensus and consistency criteria. To do that, a feedback mechanism is developed to generate advice on how experts should change or complete their preferences in order to reach a solution with high consensus and consistency degrees. In each consensus round, experts are given information on how to change their preferences, and to estimate missing values if their corresponding preference relation is incomplete. Additionally, a consensus and consistency based induced ordered weighted averaging operator to aggregate the experts' preferences is introduced, which can be used in consensus models as well as in selection processes. The main improvement of this consensus model is that it supports the management of incomplete information and it allows to achieve consistent solutions with a great level of agreement.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2006.889952","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4343109","Aggregation;consensus;fuzzy preference relations;group decision making (GDM)","Decision making;Feedback;Aggregates;Information management;Computer science;Artificial intelligence;Computational intelligence;Humans","decision making;fuzzy set theory","group decision making;fuzzy preference relations;consensus reaching process;selection process;consistency criteria;feedback mechanism","","395","","46","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

According to either the Instantaneous Power Theory or to the Fourier series analysis of the currents, each of these methods are based on a specific decomposition. The original decomposition of the currents or of the powers then allows defining the architecture and the inputs of Adaline neural networks. Different learning schemes are then used to control the inverter to inject elaborated reference currents in the power system. Results obtained by simulation and their real-time validation in experiments are presented to compare the compensation methods.

In this paper, the development of the synchronization control technique of multi-motor system is summarized. The model structure of synchronization control system of multi-motor based on PROFIBUS-DP fieldbus is proposed. MS (master-slave) communication mode is adopted. Specially, the synchronization control strategy based on this network control system is analyzed and described. It includes four parts. The first, in order to assign intelligently the given speed of each motor which in the slave station, a BP neural network arithmetic controller is set up in the DP master station. The next, in order to realize high precision control to the single motor, an adaptive double mode fuzzy PID arithmetic is adopted in the intelligent slave station. The third, the sync/freeze control method in virtue of PLC system function is adopted when the DP master transfers its command of synchronization execution to its distributed intelligent slave stations. The last, a short step control method of output frequency is adopted for the converter in the process of start and stop of motor to reduce the ill influence of some factors of equipments. It is the trend of development for the synchronization control of multiple motors to combine the technology of fieldbus with the technology of motor driving control.

For the fully automatic system of face recognition, a lot of researches have been done in many directions that eliminate the difficulties of finding and identifying faces with the illumination and pose problems. However, most of them just concentrate on these issues separately instead of consider the efficiency of the whole system while both method in face detection and recognition work together. This research tried to make compensation between those two main components. In the recognition step, eigenface technique was used to normalize faces in the database. At first, we calculate the face covariance matrix and the associated face eigenvectors. These will be the face prints. Different vectors of weights can represent different faces. After that, any face can be reconstructed from a set of weights. So we can recognize a new picture of a familiar face. For the face detection process, skin-color model was used to separate skin areas from the background in order to cut out the face block for recognizing. The whole process of face recognition can be separate into two phases: Training phase and Recognition phase. At first, we train the recognition system by using a sequence of images for each person to create the alternative face print. In the second phase, the result of the first phase will be used to match with the input face image in the video stream and then show the conclusion on whether people in video is granted or not. The experiments included both aspects: independent component and holistic system on the popular databases of face detection, recognition in still image and video. The result achieved a recognition rate at from 80 percents to 100 percents with a small number of 10 or 24 training samples.","","978-1-4244-1355-3","10.1109/ICIAS.2007.4658485","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4658485","","Artificial intelligence;Conferences","covariance matrices;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;face recognition;image colour analysis;video signal processing;visual databases","face recognition;video recognition;eigenface;adaptive skin-color model;computer vision;video images;image scenes;face database;face covariance matrix;face eigenvectors","","2","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The neuroprocessor has been designed to be employed primarily for use on mobile robotic vehicles, allowing bio-inspired neural processing models to be integrated directly into real-world control environments. When a neuroprocessor has been designed to act as part of the closed-loop system of a feedback controller, it is imperative to maintain strict real-time performance at all times, in order to maintain integrity of the control system. This resulted in the reevaluation of some of the architectural features of existing hardware for biologically plausible neural networks (NNs). In addition, we describe a development system for rapidly porting an underlying model (based on floating-point arithmetic) to the fixed-point representation of the FPGA-based neuroprocessor, thereby allowing validation of the hardware architecture.

With the increasing popularity and rising demand for more public Wi-Fi hotspots, network service providers are facing a daunting task. Wi-Fi hotspots typically require extensive wired infrastructure to access the backhaul network, which is often expensive and time consuming to provide in such situations. wireless mesh networks (WMNs) offer an easy and economical alternative for providing broadband wireless Internet connectivity and could be called the web-in-the-sky. In place of an underlying wired backbone, a WMN forms a wireless backhaul network, thus obviating the need for extensive cabling. They are based on multihop communication paradigms that dynamically form a connected network. However, multihop wireless communication is severely plagued by many limitations such as low throughput and limited capacity. In this article we point out key challenges that are impeding the rapid progress of this upcoming technology. We systematically examine each layer of the network and discuss the feasibility of some state-of-the-art technologies/protocols for adequately addressing these challenges. We also provide broader and deeper insight to many other issues that are of paramount importance for the successful deployment and wider acceptance of WMNs.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.2007.4300987","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4300987","","Wireless mesh networks;IP networks;Spread spectrum communication;Educational institutions;Spine;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless communication;Wireless LAN;Airports;Costs","Internet;radio access networks;wireless LAN","wireless mesh network;Web-in-the-sky;Wi-Fi hotspots;Internet service provisioning;network service provider;backhaul network access;broadband wireless Internet connectivity;extensive cabling;multihop wireless communication;network layer","","113","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In contrast to systems which depend solely on GPS positioning, the proposed system provides higher positioning accuracy and is capable to track the target at areas where GPS signals are weak or unavailable.

A systematic procedure to construct a family of finite-dimensional LMI relaxations is provided. The robust stability is assessed by means of the existence of a Lyapunov function, more specifically, a homogeneous polynomially parameter-dependent Lyapunov (HPPDL) function of arbitrary degree. For a given degree , if an HPPDL solution exists, a sequence of relaxations based on real algebraic properties provides sufficient LMI conditions of increasing precision and constant number of decision variables for the existence of an HPPDL function which tend to the necessity. Alternatively, if an HPPDL solution of degree exists, a sequence of relaxations which increases the number of variables and the number of LMIs will provide an HPPDL solution of larger degree. The method proposed can be applied to determine homogeneous parameter-dependent matrix solutions to a wide variety of PD-LMIs by transforming the infinite-dimensional LMI problem described in terms of uncertain parameters belonging to the unit simplex in a sequence of finite-dimensional LMI conditions which converges to the necessary conditions for the existence of a homogeneous polynomially parameter-dependent solution of arbitrary degree.

The proposed PCC does not require extra power transistor to continuously regulate the output of the doubler, thereby saving chip area. The PCC also allows the doubler to operate at lower switching frequencies without sacrificing transient response. The light-load efficiency of the regulated doubler can thus be enhanced by reducing the switching power loss. In addition, a three-stage switchable opamp with time-multiplexed enhanced active-feedback frequency compensation is developed to implement the controller. The proposed implementation enhances the speed of the loop response and then improves the load transient response of the regulated doubler. The SC voltage doubler with the proposed PCC controller has been fabricated in a 0.6-mum CMOS process. The regulated doubler achieves >87% power efficiency even for the load current of 5 mA. By operating the doubler at switching frequency of 200 kHz and using a output capacitor of 2.2 muF, a maximum output ripple of 20mV is maintained for the load current changing from 50 mA to 150 mA.

First, we linearize the nonlinear dynamics of the piezoactuator by accounting for the hysteresis (as well as creep) using high-gain feedback control. Next, we model the linear vibrational dynamics and then invert the model to find a feedforward input to account vibration - this process is significantly easier than considering the complete nonlinear dynamics (which combines hysteresis and vibration effects). Afterwards, the feedforward input is augmented to the feedback-linearized system to achieve high-precision highspeed positioning. We apply the method to a piezoscanner used in an experimental atomic force microscope to demonstrate the method's effectiveness and we show significant reduction of both the maximum and root-mean-square tracking error. For example, high-gain feedback control compensates for hysteresis and creep effects, and in our case, it reduces the maximum error (compared to the uncompensated case) by over 90%. Then, at relatively high scan rates, the performance of the feedback controlled system can be improved by over 75% (i.e., reduction of maximum error) when the inversion-based feedforward input is integrated with the high-gain feedback controlled system.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2007.902956","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4294014","Creep;feedback control;high-precision positioning;hysteresis;inversion-based feedforward control;piezo actuator;vibration","Creep;Hysteresis;Scanning probe microscopy;Vibration control;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Feedback control;Atomic force microscopy;Error correction;Adaptive control;Mechanical engineering","atomic force microscopy;creep;feedback;feedforward;hysteresis;nonlinear dynamical systems;piezoelectric actuators;vibration control","AFM piezoactuator;feedback-linearized inverse feedforward controller;creep compensation;hysteresis compensation;vibration compensation;linear vibrational dynamics;high-precision highspeed positioning;atomic force microscopy","","264","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Reliability studies have shown that the majority of failure modes in wind turbines are concentrated in drive train subassemblies, including the electrical generator and converter, and are heavily affected by wind conditions. A 30 kW test rig has been constructed, with features similar to a wind turbine drive train, to enable the development of the signal processing techniques necessary for this variable speed, high torque variation application. The test rig includes a low speed shaft, high speed shaft, gearbox and an electrical generator and can be driven by simulated wind conditions.

Most turbines to date has used geared high speed generators, but a history of gearbox reliability problems have turned many turbine manufacturers towards direct drive generators, which are very low speed, high torque, and therefore very large. Superconducting machines offer the possibility of much more compact machines, but the high cost of HTS wire to date has prevented their application to a cost sensitive market such as wind energy.

Key functionalities that a home service robot must provide are localization, navigation, object recognition and object handling. A considerable amount of research has been conducted to make the service robot perform these operations with its own sensors, actuators and a knowledge database. With all heavy sensors, actuators and a database, the robot could have performed the given tasks in a limited environment or showed the limited capabilities in a natural environment. We initiated a smart home environment project for light-weight service robots to provide reliable services by interacting with the environment through the wireless sensor networks. This environment consists of the following three main components: smart objects with an radio frequency identification (RFID) tag and smart appliances with sensor network functionality; the home server that connects smart devices as well as maintains information for reliable services; and the service robots that perform tasks in collaboration with the environment. In this paper, we introduce various types of smart devices which are developed for assisting the robot by providing sensing and actuation, and present our approach on the integration of these devices to construct the smart home environment.

As a consequence, the MA outcomes typically do not provide practical technology opportunities. This paper, therefore, proposes a new hybrid approach that enhances the performance of MA by combining it with conjoint analysis (CA) and citation analysis of patent information. First, keywords are extracted from patent documents using text mining, and the morphology of existing patents is identified by these keywords. Alternatives for new technology development from among the emerging technologies are presented by combining the valuable levels of each attribute in a morphology matrix predefined by domain experts. Then, configurations of new technology are suggested in order of priority using CA, and the technological feasibility of each new configuration is subsequently investigated. The technological competitiveness of a company can be analyzed by a newly suggested index, ldquotechnology share,rdquo which is analogous to the concept of market share in traditional CA.

The armchair edge GNR channel shares similarities with a zigzag carbon nanotube; however, it has a different geometry and quantum confinement boundary condition in the transverse direction. The results indicate that the I-V characteristics are ambipolar and strongly depend on the GNR width because the bandgap of the GNR is approximately inversely proportional to its width, which agrees with recent experiments. A multiple gate geometry improves immunity to short channel effects; however, it offers smaller improvement than it does for Si MOSFETs in terms of the on-current and transconductance. Reducing the oxide thickness is more useful for improving transistor performance than using a high-k gate insulator. Significant increase of the minimal leakage current is observed when the channel length is scaled below 10 nm because the small effective mass facilitates strong source-drain tunneling. The GNRFET, therefore, does not promise to extend the ultimate scaling limit of Si MOSFETs. The intrinsic switching speed of a GNR SBFET, however, is several times faster than that of Si MOSFETs, which could lead to promising high-speed electronics applications, where the large leakage of GNR SBFETs is of less concern.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2007.902692","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4294234","Ballistic transport;device simulation;graphene field-effect transistor;quantum transport;Schottky barrier;transistor scaling","Logic gates;Transistors;Geometry;Mathematical model;Silicon;FETs;Poisson equations","carbon nanotubes;electric properties;leakage currents;nanoelectronics;Schottky gate field effect transistors;semiconductor device models;tunnelling","scaling behaviors;graphene nanoribbon FET;3D quantum simulation;Schottky barrier field-effect transistors;nonequilibrium Green function transport equation;3D Poisson equation;I-V characteristics;multiple gate geometry;short channel effects immunity;MOSFET;oxide thickness;minimal leakage current;channel length;effective mass;source-drain tunneling;intrinsic switching;high-speed electronics;GNRFET","","117","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Examples of such systems include certain large scale process control systems, chains of coupled oscillators and supply chain management systems. Receding horizon control (RHC) is a method of choice in these venues as constraints can be explicitly accommodated. In addition, a distributed control approach is sought to enable the autonomy of the individual subsystems and reduce the computational burden of centralized implementations. In this paper, a distributed RHC algorithm is presented for dynamically coupled nonlinear systems that are subject to decoupled input constraints. By this algorithm, each subsystem computes its own control locally. Provided an initially feasible solution can be found, subsequent feasibility of the algorithm is guaranteed at every update, and asymptotic stabilization is established. The theoretical conditions for feasibility and stability are shown to be satisfied for a set of coupled Van der Pol oscillators that model a walking robot experiment. In simulations, distributed and centralized receding horizon controllers are employed for stabilization of the oscillators. The numerical experiments show that the controllers perform comparably, while the computational savings of the distributed implementation over the centralized implementation is clearly demonstrated.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2007.900828","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4268375","Coupled nonlinear oscillators;distributed control;receding horizon control (RHC);supply chain management","Distributed control;Nonlinear control systems;Control systems;Couplings;Nonlinear systems;Oscillators;Distributed computing;Legged locomotion;Centralized control;Large-scale systems","asymptotic stability;distributed control;nonlinear control systems;optimal control","dynamically coupled nonlinear systems;distributed receding horizon control problem;large scale process control systems;supply chain management systems;asymptotic stabilization;coupled Van der Pol oscillator;walking robot","","213","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We argue that the load imbalance and consequent unfair bandwidth allocation can be greatly reduced by intelligent association control. In this paper, we present an efficient solution to determine the user-AP associations for max-min fair bandwidth allocation. We show the strong correlation between fairness and load balancing, which enables us to use load balancing techniques for obtaining optimal max-min fair bandwidth allocation. As this problem is NP-hard, we devise algorithms that achieve constant-factor approximation. In our algorithms, we first compute a fractional association solution, in which users can be associated with multiple APs simultaneously. This solution guarantees the fairest bandwidth allocation in terms of max-min fairness. Then, by utilizing a rounding method, we obtain the integral solution from the fractional solution. We also consider time fairness and present a polynomial-time algorithm for optimal integral solution. We further extend our schemes for the on-line case where users may join and leave dynamically. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieve close to optimal load balancing (i.e., max-min fairness) and they outperform commonly used heuristics.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2007.893680","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4237137","Approximation algorithms;IEEE 802.11 WLANs;load balancing;max-min fairness","Load management;Wireless LAN;Channel allocation;Bandwidth;Telecommunication traffic;Intelligent control;Approximation algorithms;Polynomials;Heuristic algorithms;Throughput","bandwidth allocation;resource allocation;wireless LAN","load balancing;wireless LAN;association control;traffic load;max min fair bandwidth allocation;constant factor approximation;fractional association solution;rounding method;polynomial time algorithm;optimal integral solution","","195","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There have been tremendous efforts in the design and experimentation of video-streaming systems in the past two decades; there have been no shortage of technical innovations, yet no single system has delivered the scale and service quality. The fundamental problem that throttles the large-scale deployment of Internet video streaming is the dissatisfaction end-users experience with performance. This is caused by a combination of many factors, such as the autonomous nature of the Internet, inherent instability, and lack of a service guarantee. This is further challenged by sustainable bandwidth and the stringent continuity requirements of streaming applications. Recent development of P2P-based streaming technology brings unprecedented new momentum to Internet video streaming, which has been shown to be cost-effective, scalable, and easy to deploy. This article reviews the state-of-the-art P2P live video-streaming technologies and their development from a historic perspective.

It is shown that randomly scattered nodes can achieve, with high probability, the same 1/radicn transmission rate of arbitrarily located nodes. This contrasts with previous results suggesting that a 1/radicnlogn reduced rate is the price to pay for the randomness due to the location of the nodes. The network operation strategy to achieve the result corresponds to the transition region between order and disorder of an underlying percolation model. If nodes are allowed to transmit over large distances, then paths of connected nodes that cross the entire network area can be easily found, but these generate excessive interference. If nodes transmit over short distances, then such crossing paths do not exist. Percolation theory ensures that crossing paths form in the transition region between these two extreme scenarios. Nodes along these paths are used as a backbone, relaying data for other nodes, and can transport the total amount of information generated by all the sources.

When it is worn, it transmits torques from actuators through rigid exoskeletal links to the human joints. We have been developing exoskeleton robots for assisting the motions of physically weak persons such as elderly or disabled in daily life. In this paper, we propose an electromyogram (EMG) based control (i.e., control based on the skin surface EMG signals of the user) for the exoskeleton robot to assist physically weak person's lower-limb motions.

The output voltage of a CC power supply increases linearly with the load resistance.

A novel LCL-T resonant converter with clamp diodes is proposed in this paper, which has built-in CC-CV characteristics. Since the CC-CV characteristics are inherent to the converter, and complex feedback control is not required, the proposed converter is rugged and reliable. The principle of operation of the converter is explained. Experimental results on a 500-W prototype are presented to demonstrate the inherent CC-CV behavior of the converter.

"Uniform Concentric Circular Arrays With Frequency-Invariant Characteristics—Theory, Design, Adaptive Beamforming and DOA Estimation","S. C. Chan; H. H. Chen","Dept. of Electr. & Electron. Eng., Hong Kong Univ.; Dept. of Electr. & Electron. Eng., Hong Kong Univ.","IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","","2007","55","1","165","177","This paper proposes a new digital beamformer for uniform concentric circular arrays (UCCAs) having nearly frequency-invariant (FI) characteristics. The basic principle is to transform the received signals to the phase mode and remove the frequency dependency of the individual phase mode through the use of a digital beamforming or compensation network. As a result, the far-field pattern of the array, which is governed by a set of variable beamformer weights, is electronically steerable, and it is approximately invariant over a wider range of frequencies than conventional uniform circular arrays (UCAs). This also makes it possible to design the compensation network and the beamformer weights separately. The design of the compensation network is formulated as a second order cone programming (SOCP) problem and is solved optimally for minimax criterion. By employing the beamspace approach using the outputs of a set of fixed UCCA frequency-invariant beamformers (FIBs), a new beamspace MUSIC algorithm is proposed for estimating the direction-of-arrivals (DOAs) of broadband sources. Since the beampatterns of the UCCA-FIB is approximately invariant with frequency and is governed by a small set of weights, a very efficient adaptive beamformer using the minimum variance beamforming (MVB) approach can be developed. Simulation results using broadband Gaussian and multisinusoidal inputs show that the proposed adaptive UCCA-FIB is numerically better conditioned than the conventional broadband tapped-delay-line-based adaptive beamformers, due to the FI property and significantly fewer numbers of adaptive parameters. Consequently, a higher output signal-to-inference-plus-noise ratio over the conventional tapped-delay-line approach is observed. The usefulness of the proposed UCCA-FIB in broadband DOA estimation is also verified by computer simulation","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2006.882109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4034131","Array processing;beamspace;broadband adaptive beamforming;broadband direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation;design method;frequency invariant (FI);uniform concentric circular array (UCCA)","Frequency estimation;Adaptive arrays;Array signal processing;Direction of arrival estimation;Sensor arrays;Interference suppression;Transversal filters;Acoustic beams;Apertures;Student members","array signal processing;direction-of-arrival estimation;minimax techniques","uniform concentric circular arrays;frequency-invariant characteristics;adaptive beamforming;DOA estimation;digital beamformer;second order cone programming;minimax criterion;beamspace approach;MUSIC algorithm;direction-of-arrivals estimation;broadband sources;beampatterns;minimum variance beamforming approach;broadband Gaussian;multisinusoidal inputs;signal-to-inference-plus-noise ratio","","84","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, when mass production is needed, FPGA (field-programmable gate array) based drivers are preferred since the FPGA based design is compatible with conversation to an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit). Previous studies proposed FPGA based drivers but the quality is still limited because of the difficulty of handling complex computations in the FPGA.

However, the complexities of these models and the difficulties of implementing them in software programs can be deterrents to their use. This paper proposes a simple, robust and flexible piecewise linear PV device model for dynamic and transient power system studies.

Using Ad-aBoost, these shapelet features are created as a combination of oriented gradient responses. To train the final classifier, we use AdaBoost for a second time to select a subset of our learned shapelets. By first focusing locally on smaller feature sets, our algorithm attempts to harvest more useful information than by examining all the low-level features together.

In contrast to the gate-driven based OTAs (that have the tradeoff of input and tuning range), BD-based OTAs operate under a wide input range over a large tuning interval. Common-mode (CM) feedforward and CM feedback schemes have been developed so that the CM voltage varies only 7 mV over a tuning range of 1.2 V = Vtune = 1.58 V.

Methods such as shape-from-texture, shape-from-shading, shape-from-focus, and shape-from-motion extraction can restore 3D shape information from a single camera data. The existing techniques for 3D extraction from single-camera video sequences are especially useful for conversion of the already available vast mono-view content to the 3DTV systems. Scene-oriented single-camera methods such as human face reconstruction and facial motion analysis, body modeling and body motion tracking, and motion recognition solve efficiently a variety of tasks. 3D multicamera dynamic acquisition and reconstruction, their hardware specifics including calibration and synchronization and software demands form another area of intensive research. Different classes of multiview stereo algorithms such as those based on cost function computing and optimization, fusing of multiple views, and feature-point reconstruction are possible candidates for dynamic 3D reconstruction. High-resolution digital holography and pattern projection techniques such as coded light or fringe projection for real-time extraction of 3D object positions and color information could manifest themselves as an alternative to traditional camera-based methods.

The designed comparator presents a rail-to-rail input range preamplifier without any capacitance required. This comparator with a novel architecture of output stage achieves very high speed at a low kickback noise. The simulation results using a 0.35μm TSMC CMOS process technology show that this comparator exhibits a propagation delay of 2.8ns and has a very high resolution for a rail-to-rail input signal range, while consumes only 1.0mW of power with 5.0V voltage supply.","2163-5056","1-4244-1035-5","10.1109/IWASID.2007.373688","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4244774","","Pipelines;Analog-digital conversion;Rail to rail inputs;Frequency conversion;Wireless LAN;Preamplifiers;Capacitance;CMOS process;CMOS technology;Propagation delay","analogue-digital conversion;CMOS integrated circuits;comparators (circuits);wireless LAN","high-speed high-resolution latch comparator;pipeline analog-to-digital converters;frequency wireless local area network application;rail-to-rail input range preamplifier;kickback noise;TSMC CMOS process technology;propagation delay","","12","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
