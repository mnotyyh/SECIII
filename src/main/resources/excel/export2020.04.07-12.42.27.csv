Under the assumption that human visual perception is highly adapted for extracting structural information from a scene, we introduce an alternative complementary framework for quality assessment based on the degradation of structural information. As a specific example of this concept, we develop a structural similarity index and demonstrate its promise through a set of intuitive examples, as well as comparison to both subjective ratings and state-of-the-art objective methods on a database of images compressed with JPEG and JPEG2000.

We analyze three cases: 1) directed networks with fixed topology; 2) directed networks with switching topology; and 3) undirected networks with communication time-delays and fixed topology. We introduce two consensus protocols for networks with and without time-delays and provide a convergence analysis in all three cases. We establish a direct connection between the algebraic connectivity (or Fiedler eigenvalue) of the network and the performance (or negotiation speed) of a linear consensus protocol. This required the generalization of the notion of algebraic connectivity of undirected graphs to digraphs. It turns out that balanced digraphs play a key role in addressing average-consensus problems. We introduce disagreement functions for convergence analysis of consensus protocols. A disagreement function is a Lyapunov function for the disagreement network dynamics. We proposed a simple disagreement function that is a common Lyapunov function for the disagreement dynamics of a directed network with switching topology. A distinctive feature of this work is to address consensus problems for networks with directed information flow. We provide analytical tools that rely on algebraic graph theory, matrix theory, and control theory. Simulations are provided that demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2004.834113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1333204","","Intelligent networks;Network topology;Vehicle dynamics;Communication switching;Protocols;Control systems;Convergence;Laplace equations;Automatic control;Communication system control","delays;convergence;Lyapunov methods;graph theory;matrix algebra;control theory;time-varying systems","switching topology;time-delays;dynamic agent networks;convergence analysis;linear consensus protocols;Lyapunov functions;graph theory;matrix theory;control theory","","7182","","39","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The underlying techniques exploit space diversity available through cooperating terminals' relaying signals for one another. We outline several strategies employed by the cooperating radios, including fixed relaying schemes such as amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward, selection relaying schemes that adapt based upon channel measurements between the cooperating terminals, and incremental relaying schemes that adapt based upon limited feedback from the destination terminal. We develop performance characterizations in terms of outage events and associated outage probabilities, which measure robustness of the transmissions to fading, focusing on the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Except for fixed decode-and-forward, all of our cooperative diversity protocols are efficient in the sense that they achieve full diversity (i.e., second-order diversity in the case of two terminals), and, moreover, are close to optimum (within 1.5 dB) in certain regimes. Thus, using distributed antennas, we can provide the powerful benefits of space diversity without need for physical arrays, though at a loss of spectral efficiency due to half-duplex operation and possibly at the cost of additional receive hardware. Applicable to any wireless setting, including cellular or ad hoc networks-wherever space constraints preclude the use of physical arrays-the performance characterizations reveal that large power or energy savings result from the use of these protocols.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2004.838089","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1362898","Diversity techniques;fading channels;outage probability;relay channel;user cooperation;wireless networks","Wireless networks;Wireless application protocol;Relays;Fading;Decoding;Feedback;Robustness;Signal to noise ratio;Receiving antennas;Antenna arrays","fading channels;multipath channels;cellular radio;ad hoc networks;diversity reception;antenna arrays;probability;protocols","wireless network;cooperative diversity protocol;fading channel;multipath propagation;cooperating terminal relaying signal;cooperating radio;channel measurement;outage probability;amplify-and-forward;decode-and-forward;selection relaying schemes;incremental relaying schemes;signal-to-noise ratio;SNR;distributed antenna;space diversity;spectral efficiency;half-duplex operation;ad hoc network;cellular networks;relay channel","","9337","","42","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many routing, power management, and data dissemination protocols have been specifically designed for WSNs where energy awareness is an essential design issue. Routing protocols in WSNs might differ depending on the application and network architecture. In this article we present a survey of state-of-the-art routing techniques in WSNs. We first outline the design challenges for routing protocols in WSNs followed by a comprehensive survey of routing techniques. Overall, the routing techniques are classified into three categories based on the underlying network structure: flit, hierarchical, and location-based routing. Furthermore, these protocols can be classified into multipath-based, query-based, negotiation-based, QoS-based, and coherent-based depending on the protocol operation. We study the design trade-offs between energy and communication overhead savings in every routing paradigm. We also highlight the advantages and performance issues of each routing technique.

The challenge in such multiuser systems is designing transmit vectors while considering the co-channel interference of other users. Typical optimization problems of interest include the capacity problem - maximizing the sum information rate subject to a power constraint-or the power control problem-minimizing transmitted power such that a certain quality-of-service metric for each user is met. Neither of these problems possess closed-form solutions for the general multiuser MIMO channel, but the imposition of certain constraints can lead to closed-form solutions. This paper presents two such constrained solutions. The first, referred to as ""block-diagonalization,"" is a generalization of channel inversion when there are multiple antennas at each receiver. It is easily adapted to optimize for either maximum transmission rate or minimum power and approaches the optimal solution at high SNR. The second, known as ""successive optimization,"" is an alternative method for solving the power minimization problem one user at a time, and it yields superior results in some (e.g., low SNR) situations. Both of these algorithms are limited to cases where the transmitter has more antennas than all receive antennas combined. In order to accommodate more general scenarios, we also propose a framework for coordinated transmitter-receiver processing that generalizes the two algorithms to cases involving more receive than transmit antennas. While the proposed algorithms are suboptimal, they lead to simpler transmitter and receiver structures and allow for a reasonable tradeoff between performance and complexity.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2003.821107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1261332","","Downlink;MIMO;Receiving antennas;Closed-form solution;Transmitters;Transmitting antennas;Multiaccess communication;Wireless communication;Throughput;Interchannel interference","multiuser channels;MIMO systems;space division multiple access;radio networks;optimisation;cochannel interference;quality of service;antenna arrays;array signal processing;space division multiplexing;radio transmitters;radio receivers","zero-forcing methods;downlink spatial multiplexing;multiuser MIMO channels;space-division multiple access;multiple-input multiple-output wireless communication networks;transmit vectors designing;cochannel interference;optimization problems;power constraint;power control;quality-of-service;closed-form solutions;block-diagonalization;channel inversion;multiple antennas;maximum transmission rate;successive optimization;power minimization problem;transmitter-receiver processing;wireless LAN;SDMA","","2066","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many of these difficulties arise from its use of linearization. To overcome this limitation, the unscented transformation (UT) was developed as a method to propagate mean and covariance information through nonlinear transformations. It is more accurate, easier to implement, and uses the same order of calculations as linearization.

Clustering sensor nodes is an effective topology control approach. We propose a novel distributed clustering approach for long-lived ad hoc sensor networks. Our proposed approach does not make any assumptions about the presence of infrastructure or about node capabilities, other than the availability of multiple power levels in sensor nodes. We present a protocol, HEED (Hybrid Energy-Efficient Distributed clustering), that periodically selects cluster heads according to a hybrid of the node residual energy and a secondary parameter, such as node proximity to its neighbors or node degree. HEED terminates in O(1) iterations, incurs low message overhead, and achieves fairly uniform cluster head distribution across the network. We prove that, with appropriate bounds on node density and intracluster and intercluster transmission ranges, HEED can asymptotically almost surely guarantee connectivity of clustered networks. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective in prolonging the network lifetime and supporting scalable data aggregation.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2004.41","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1347100","Index Terms- Sensor networks;clustering;network lifetime;energy efficiency;fault tolerance.","Energy efficiency;Energy consumption;Chemical sensors;Scalability;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Network topology;Delay;Routing protocols;Availability;Fault tolerance","ad hoc networks;wireless sensor networks;telecommunication network reliability;protocols;iterative methods;fault tolerance;telecommunication network topology;mobile radio","HEED approach;ad hoc sensor networks;network scalability;topology control approach;hybrid energy-efficient distributed clustering;iteration methods;intercluster transmission;intracluster transmission;network lifetime;fault tolerance;minimum selection probability","","2715","","45","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two key reasons behind may be: 1) the slow gradient-based learning algorithms are extensively used to train neural networks, and 2) all the parameters of the networks are tuned iteratively by using such learning algorithms. Unlike these traditional implementations, this paper proposes a new learning algorithm called extreme learning machine (ELM) for single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) which randomly chooses the input weights and analytically determines the output weights of SLFNs. In theory, this algorithm tends to provide the best generalization performance at extremely fast learning speed. The experimental results based on real-world benchmarking function approximation and classification problems including large complex applications show that the new algorithm can produce best generalization performance in some cases and can learn much faster than traditional popular learning algorithms for feedforward neural networks.","1098-7576","0-7803-8359-1","10.1109/IJCNN.2004.1380068","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1380068","","Machine learning;Neural networks;Feedforward neural networks;Iterative algorithms;Function approximation;Approximation algorithms;Neurons;Joining processes;Algorithm design and analysis;Multi-layer neural network","feedforward neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);generalisation (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;function approximation;gradient methods","extreme learning machine;single hidden layer feedforward neural networks;learning speed;slow gradient based learning algorithms;neural network training;iterative tuning;function approximation;classification problems;network parameter tuning","","453","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental comparison of the efficiency of min-cut/max flow algorithms for applications in vision. We compare the running times of several standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed.

This allows for designing wide-band impedance-matching amplifiers with NF well below 3 dB, without suffering from instability issues. An amplifier realized in 0.25-/spl mu/m standard CMOS shows NF values below 2.4 dB over more than one decade of bandwidth (i.e., 150-2000 MHz) and below 2 dB over more than two octaves (i.e., 250-1100 MHz).

Instead, an image covariance matrix is constructed directly using the original image matrices, and its eigenvectors are derived for image feature extraction. To test 2DPCA and evaluate its performance, a series of experiments were performed on three face image databases: ORL, AR, and Yale face databases. The recognition rate across all trials was higher using 2DPCA than PCA.

Ignoring fading in NLOS environments, we can, in principle, meet the 1 Gb/s data rate requirement with a single-transmit single-receive antenna wireless system if the product of bandwidth (measured in hertz) and spectral efficiency (measured in bits per second per hertz) is equal to 10/sup 9/.

To improve radio sensitivity of the sensing function through processing gain we investigated three digital signal processing techniques: matched filtering, energy detection and cyclostationary feature detection.

However, the typical BCI system is designed specifically for one particular BCI method and is, therefore, not suited to the systematic studies that are essential for continued progress. In response to this problem, we have developed a documented general-purpose BCI research and development platform called BCI2000. BCI2000 can incorporate alone or in combination any brain signals, signal processing methods, output devices, and operating protocols. This report is intended to describe to investigators, biomedical engineers, and computer scientists the concepts that the BCI2000 system is based upon and gives examples of successful BCI implementations using this system. To date, we have used BCI2000 to create BCI systems for a variety of brain signals, processing methods, and applications. The data show that these systems function well in online operation and that BCI2000 satisfies the stringent real-time requirements of BCI systems. By substantially reducing labor and cost, BCI2000 facilitates the implementation of different BCI systems and other psychophysiological experiments.

We address this problem starting from the discrete Kalman filtering formulation, and modeling the arrival of the observation as a random process. We study the statistical convergence properties of the estimation error covariance, showing the existence of a critical value for the arrival rate of the observations, beyond which a transition to an unbounded state error covariance occurs.

First, we propose a theoretical discussion and experimental analysis aimed at understanding and assessing the potentialities of SVM classifiers in hyperdimensional feature spaces. Then, we assess the effectiveness of SVMs with respect to conventional feature-reduction-based approaches and their performances in hypersubspaces of various dimensionalities. To sustain such an analysis, the performances of SVMs are compared with those of two other nonparametric classifiers (i.e., radial basis function neural networks and the K-nearest neighbor classifier). Finally, we study the potentially critical issue of applying binary SVMs to multiclass problems in hyperspectral data. In particular, four different multiclass strategies are analyzed and compared: the one-against-all, the one-against-one, and two hierarchical tree-based strategies. Different performance indicators have been used to support our experimental studies in a detailed and accurate way, i.e., the classification accuracy, the computational time, the stability to parameter setting, and the complexity of the multiclass architecture. The results obtained on a real Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectroradiometer hyperspectral dataset allow to conclude that, whatever the multiclass strategy adopted, SVMs are a valid and effective alternative to conventional pattern recognition approaches (feature-reduction procedures combined with a classification method) for the classification of hyperspectral remote sensing data.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.831865","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1323134","","Hyperspectral sensors;Hyperspectral imaging;Remote sensing;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Performance analysis;Radial basis function networks;Stability;Computer architecture;Infrared imaging","remote sensing;image classification;spectral analysis;geophysical signal processing;data acquisition;support vector machines;multidimensional signal processing;feature extraction","image classification;hyperspectral remote sensing images;support vector machines;SVM classifiers;hyperdimensional feature spaces;hypersubspaces;nonparametric classifiers;radial basis function neural networks;K-nearest neighbor classifier;binary SVM;multiclass problems;multiclass strategies;hierarchical tree-based strategies;multiclass architecture complexity;Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectroradiometer hyperspectral dataset;pattern recognition;feature reduction;Hughes phenomenon","","1887","","48","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A better way to realize the emerging potential of distributed generation is to take a system approach which views generation and associated loads as a subsystem or a ""microgrid"". During disturbances, the generation and corresponding loads can separate from the distribution system to isolate the microgrid's load from the disturbance (providing UPS services) without harming the transmission grid's integrity. This ability to island generation and loads together has a potential to provide a higher local reliability than that provided by the power system as a whole. In this model it is also critical to be able to use the waste heat by placing the sources near the heat load. This implies that a unit can be placed at any point on the electrical system as required by the location of the heat load.","0275-9306","0-7803-8399-0","10.1109/PESC.2004.1354758","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1354758","","Distributed control;Power system reliability;Waste heat;Power generation;Distributed power generation;Cogeneration;Engines;Mesh generation;Power system modeling;Inverters","distributed power generation;power system interconnection;power generation faults;power generation reliability","distributed generator;distributed generation;microgrid;distribution system;transmission grid;generation islanding;load islanding","","847","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ltd., Cambridge, UK","IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","","2004","13","9","1200","1212","A new algorithm is proposed for removing large objects from digital images. The challenge is to fill in the hole that is left behind in a visually plausible way. In the past, this problem has been addressed by two classes of algorithms: 1) ""texture synthesis"" algorithms for generating large image regions from sample textures and 2) ""inpainting"" techniques for filling in small image gaps. The former has been demonstrated for ""textures""-repeating two-dimensional patterns with some stochasticity; the latter focus on linear ""structures"" which can be thought of as one-dimensional patterns, such as lines and object contours. This paper presents a novel and efficient algorithm that combines the advantages of these two approaches. We first note that exemplar-based texture synthesis contains the essential process required to replicate both texture and structure; the success of structure propagation, however, is highly dependent on the order in which the filling proceeds. We propose a best-first algorithm in which the confidence in the synthesized pixel values is propagated in a manner similar to the propagation of information in inpainting. The actual color values are computed using exemplar-based synthesis. In this paper, the simultaneous propagation of texture and structure information is achieved by a single , efficient algorithm. Computational efficiency is achieved by a block-based sampling process. A number of examples on real and synthetic images demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in removing large occluding objects, as well as thin scratches. Robustness with respect to the shape of the manually selected target region is also demonstrated. Our results compare favorably to those obtained by existing techniques.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2004.833105","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1323101","","Filling;Digital images;Image generation;Computational efficiency;Image sampling;Robustness;Shape;Humans;Two dimensional displays;Water resources","image texture;image colour analysis;image sampling;image restoration","region filling;object removal;exemplar-based image inpainting;digital images;texture synthesis algorithms;structure propagation;best-first algorithm;color images;image sampling process;image restoration","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Hypermedia;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Paintings;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique","1503","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a general approach is presented to identify the power transfer capability and bifurcation phenomena (multiple operating modes) for such systems. This is achieved using a high order mathematical model consisting of both primary and secondary resonant circuits. The primary compensation is deliberately designed to make the primary zero phase angle frequency equal the secondary resonant frequency to achieve maximum power with minimum VA rating of the supply. A contactless electric vehicle battery charger was used to validate the theory by comparing the measured and calculated operational frequency and power transfer. For bifurcation-free operation, the power transfer capability and controllability are assured by following the proposed bifurcation criteria. Where controllable operation within the bifurcation region is achievable, a significant increase in power is possible.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2003.822038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265794","","Bifurcation;Air gaps;Magnetic resonance;Coupling circuits;Mathematical model;RLC circuits;Resonant frequency;Electric vehicles;Batteries;Current measurement","inductive power transmission;electromagnetic coupling;bifurcation;battery chargers;resonant power convertors","loosely coupled inductive power transfer systems;power transfer capability;bifurcation phenomena;stationary primary source;movable secondary loads;magnetic coupling;multiple operating modes;high order mathematical model;primary resonant circuits;secondary resonant circuits;zero phase angle frequency;contactless battery charger;electric vehicle battery charger;controllable operation;variable frequency controllers;mutual inductance coupling","","651","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unique requirements for small distributed power generation systems include low cost, high efficiency and tolerance for an extremely wide range of input voltage variations. These requirements have driven the inverter development toward simpler topologies and structures, lower component counts, and tighter modular design. Both single-stage and multiple-stage inverters have been developed for power conversion in DG systems. Single-stage inverters offer simple structure and low cost, but suffer from a limited range of input voltage variations and are often characterized by compromised system performance. On the other hand, multiple-stage inverters accept a wide range of input voltage variations, but suffer from high cost, complicated structure and low efficiency. Various circuit topologies are presented, compared, and evaluated against the requirements of power decoupling and dual-grounding, the capabilities for grid-connected or/and stand-alone operations, and specific DG applications in this paper, along with the identification of recent development trends of single-phase inverters for distributed power generators.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2004.833460","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1331492","","Topology;Inverters;Distributed power generation;Power generation;Costs;Voltage;Quality assurance;Power system protection;Control systems;Power conversion","invertors;distributed power generation;DC-AC power convertors;power system interconnection;network topology","single-phase inverter topology;small distributed power generators;dc-ac conversion;output power quality assurance;power conversion;circuit topology;power decoupling;grid-connected capability;single-stage inverters","","587","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The controller also incorporates synchronization algorithms for ensuring smooth and safe reconnection of the micro and utility grids when the fault is cleared. With the implementation of the unified controller, the multibus microgrid system is able to switch between islanding and grid-connected modes without disrupting the critical loads connected to it.

We propose an alternate approach using L/sub 1/ norm minimization and robust regularization based on a bilateral prior to deal with different data and noise models.

As a result, the study of multi-user MIMO systems has emerged recently as an important research topic. Such systems have the potential to combine the high capacity achievable with MIMO processing with the benefits of space-division multiple access. In this article we review several algorithms that have been proposed with this goal in mind. We describe two classes of solutions.

The proposed LPR technique consists of two main modules: a license plate locating module and a license number identification module. The former characterized by fuzzy disciplines attempts to extract license plates from an input image, while the latter conceptualized in terms of neural subjects aims to identify the number present in a license plate. Experiments have been conducted for the respective modules. In the experiment on locating license plates, 1088 images taken from various scenes and under different conditions were employed. Of which, 23 images have been failed to locate the license plates present in the images; the license plate location rate of success is 97.9%.

We first consider multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) systems based on Alamouti diversity schemes, which have good spectral efficiency but also more circuitry that consumes energy. We then extend our energy-efficiency analysis of MIMO systems to individual single-antenna nodes that cooperate to form multiple-antenna transmitters or receivers. By transmitting and/or receiving information jointly, we show that tremendous energy saving is possible for transmission distances larger than a given threshold, even when we take into account the local energy cost necessary for joint information transmission and reception.

The proposed control technique, based on the droop control method, uses only locally measurable feedback signals. This method is usually applied to achieve good active and reactive power sharing when communication between the inverters is difficult due to its physical location. However, the conventional voltage and frequency droop methods of achieving load sharing have a slow and oscillating transient response. Moreover, there is no possibility to modify the transient response without the loss of power sharing precision or output-voltage and frequency accuracy. In this work, a great improvement in transient response is achieved by introducing power derivative-integral terms into a conventional droop scheme. Hence, better controllability of the system is obtained and, consequently, correct transient performance can be achieved. In addition, an instantaneous current control loop is also included in the novel controller to ensure correct sharing of harmonic components when supplying nonlinear loads. Simulation and experimental results are presented to prove the validity of this approach, which shows excellent performance as opposed to the conventional one.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2004.833451","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1331481","","Control systems;Inverters;Distributed control;Communication system control;Transient response;Frequency;Feedback;Reactive power;Voltage;Controllability","power generation control;distributed power generation;transient response;electric current control;invertors;power distribution control","wireless controller;parallel inverters control strategy;distributed generation systems;droop control method;feedback signal measurement;reactive power sharing;load sharing;oscillating transient response;system controllability;current control loop;nonlinear loads","","626","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When the current controlled inverter is connected to the grid, the phase error results in a power factor decrement and the limited disturbance rejection capability leads to the need of grid feed-forward compensation. However the imperfect compensation action of the feed-forward control results in high harmonic distortion of the current and consequently noncompliance with international standards. In this paper a new control strategy aimed to mitigate these problems is proposed. Stationary-frame generalized integrators are used to control the fundamental current and to compensate the grid harmonics providing disturbance rejection capability without the need of feed-forward grid compensation. Moreover the use of a grid LCL-filter is investigated with the proposed controller. The current control strategy has been experimentally tested with success on a 3 kW PV inverter.","","0-7803-8269-2","10.1109/APEC.2004.1295865","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1295865","","Steady-state;Error correction;Power harmonic filters;Pulse width modulation inverters;Active filters;Feedforward systems;Current control;Consumer electronics;Photovoltaic systems;Resonant frequency","photovoltaic cells;invertors;harmonic distortion;PI control;electric current control;power factor correction;power harmonic filters;compensation;controllers","photovoltaic inverters;PV;zero steady-state error;selective harmonic compensation;PI current control;disturbance rejection capability;current controlled inverter;phase error;power factor decrement;grid feed-forward compensation;feed-forward control;harmonic distortion;international standards;LCL-filter;current control strategy;3 kW","","252","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It provides a sufficient condition under which both OMP and Donoho's basis pursuit (BP) paradigm can recover the optimal representation of an exactly sparse signal. It leverages this theory to show that both OMP and BP succeed for every sparse input signal from a wide class of dictionaries. These quasi-incoherent dictionaries offer a natural generalization of incoherent dictionaries, and the cumulative coherence function is introduced to quantify the level of incoherence. This analysis unifies all the recent results on BP and extends them to OMP. Furthermore, the paper develops a sufficient condition under which OMP can identify atoms from an optimal approximation of a nonsparse signal. From there, it argues that OMP is an approximation algorithm for the sparse problem over a quasi-incoherent dictionary. That is, for every input signal, OMP calculates a sparse approximant whose error is only a small factor worse than the minimal error that can be attained with the same number of terms.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2004.834793","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337101","","Approximation algorithms;Matching pursuit algorithms;Dictionaries;Greedy algorithms;Sufficient conditions;Iterative algorithms;Approximation methods;Linear programming;Signal processing;Iterative methods","algorithm theory;sparse matrices;redundant number systems;approximation theory;linear programming;dictionaries;signal processing","greedy algorithm;orthogonal matching pursuit;OMP;sparse approximation problem;redundant dictionary;Donoho's basis pursuit;BP paradigm;quasiincoherent dictionary;cumulative coherence function;atoms identification;optimal approximation;nonsparse signal;iterative method;linear programming","","1900","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, instead of focusing on a particular PA model and building a corresponding predistorter, we focus directly on the predistorter structure.

The total transmit power is limited and channel information (possibly statistical) is available at the transmitter. The design goal: jointly adjust the beamformers and transmission powers according to individual SINR requirements. In this context, there are two closely related optimization problems. P1: maximize the jointly achievable SINR margin under a total power constraint. P2: minimize the total transmission power while satisfying a set of SINR constraints. In this paper, both problems are solved within a unified analytical framework. Problem P1 is solved by minimizing the maximal eigenvalue of an extended crosstalk matrix. The solution provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the feasibility of the SINR requirements. Problem P2 is a variation of problem P1. An important step in our analysis is to show that the global optimum of the downlink beamforming problem is equivalently obtained from solving a dual uplink problem, which has an easier-to-handle analytical structure. Then, we make use of the special structure of the extended crosstalk matrix to develop a rapidly converging iterative algorithm.

Unlike beamforming, which presumes a high correlation between signals either transmitted or received by an array, the MIMO concept exploits the independence between signals at the array elements. In conventional radar, target scintillations are regarded as a nuisance parameter that degrades radar performance. The novelty of MIMO radar is that it takes the opposite view; namely, it capitalizes on target scintillations to improve the radar's performance. We introduce the MIMO concept for radar. The MIMO radar system under consideration consists of a transmit array with widely-spaced elements such that each views a different aspect of the target. The array at the receiver is a conventional array used for direction finding (DF). The system performance analysis is carried out in terms of the Cramer-Rao bound of the mean-square error in estimating the target direction. It is shown that MIMO radar leads to significant performance improvement in DF accuracy.","","0-7803-8234-X","10.1109/NRC.2004.1316398","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1316398","","MIMO;Radar antennas;Sensor arrays;Transmitting antennas;Radar cross section;Array signal processing;Sonar;Maximum likelihood estimation;Spaceborne radar;Directive antennas","radar antennas;antenna arrays;transmitting antennas;receiving antennas;MIMO systems;radio direction-finding;mean square error methods;direction-of-arrival estimation;radar signal processing;array signal processing;radar theory","multiple-input multiple-output antenna systems;beamforming;radar target scintillation;transmit array;receiver array;direction finding;Cramer-Rao bound;mean-square error estimation;target direction estimation;MIMO radar signal model;array signal processing","","699","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using the exact image formulation for the fields of elementary sources above impedance surfaces, it is shown that a purely reactive impedance plane with a specific surface reactance can minimize the interaction between the elementary source and its image in the RIS substrate. An RIS can be tuned anywhere between perfectly electric and magnetic conductor (PEC and PMC) surfaces offering a property to achieve the optimal bandwidth and miniaturization factor. It is demonstrated that RIS can provide performance superior to PMC when used as substrate for antennas. The RIS substrate is designed utilizing two-dimensional periodic printed metallic patches on a metal-backed high dielectric material. A simplified circuit model describing the physical phenomenon of the periodic surface is developed for simple analysis and design of the RIS substrate. Also a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) full-wave analysis in conjunction with periodic boundary conditions and perfectly matched layer walls is applied to provide comprehensive study and analysis of complex antennas on such substrates. Examples of different planar antennas including dipole and patch antennas on RIS are considered, and their characteristics are compared with those obtained from the same antennas over PEC and PMC. The simulations compare very well with measured results obtained from a prototype /spl lambda//10 miniaturized patch antenna fabricated on an RIS substrate.

To make practical use of antennas inside a human body, resonance characteristics of the implanted antennas and their radiation signature outside the body must be evaluated through numerical analysis and measurement setup. Most importantly, the antenna must be designed with an in-depth consideration given to its surrounding environment. In this paper, the spherical dyadic Green's function (DGF) expansions and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) code are applied to analyze the electromagnetic characteristics of dipole antennas and low-profile patch antennas implanted in the human head and body. All studies to characterize and design the implanted antennas are performed at the biomedical frequency band of 402-405 MHz. By comparing the results from two numerical methodologies, the accuracy of the spherical DGF application for a dipole antenna at the center of the head is evaluated. We also consider how much impact a shoulder has on the performance of the dipole inside the head using FDTD. For the ease of the design of implanted low-profile antennas, simplified planar geometries based on a real human body are proposed. Two types of low-profile antennas, i.e., a spiral microstrip antenna and a planar inverted-F antenna, with superstrate dielectric layers are initially designed for medical devices implanted in the chest of the human body using FDTD simulations. The radiation performances of the designed low-profile antennas are estimated in terms of radiation patterns, radiation efficiency, and specific absorption rate. Maximum available power calculated to characterize the performance of a communication link between the designed antennas and an exterior antenna show how sensitive receivers are required to build a reliable telemetry link.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2004.832018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1318789","","Humans;Biological system modeling;Dipole antennas;Finite difference methods;Time domain analysis;Microstrip antennas;Head;Receiving antennas;Hyperthermia;Biomedical telemetry","hyperthermia;biomedical telemetry;dipole antennas;radiation therapy;Green's function methods;finite difference time-domain analysis;radiotelemetry;UHF antennas;prosthetics","implanted antennas;biotelemetry;hyperthermia;numerical analysis;radiation signature;spherical dyadic Green function;finite difference time domain code;electromagnetic properties;profile patch antennas;human head;human body;biomedical frequency band;dipole antenna;radiation pattern;radiation efficiency;specific absorption rate;communication link;sensitive receivers;reliable telemetry link;human body chest;402 to 405 MHz","","456","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Data was obtained from the 44 nonpacemaker recordings of the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The data was split into two datasets with each dataset containing approximately 50 000 beats from 22 recordings. The first dataset was used to select a classifier configuration from candidate configurations. Twelve configurations processing feature sets derived from two ECG leads were compared. Feature sets were based on ECG morphology, heartbeat intervals, and RR-intervals. All configurations adopted a statistical classifier model utilizing supervised learning. The second dataset was used to provide an independent performance assessment of the selected configuration. This assessment resulted in a sensitivity of 75.9%, a positive predictivity of 38.5%, and a false positive rate of 4.7% for the SVEB class.

The recognition principle is the failure of a test of statistical independence on iris phase structure encoded by multi-scale quadrature wavelets. The combinatorial complexity of this phase information across different persons spans about 249 degrees of freedom and generates a discrimination entropy of about 3.2 b/mm/sup 2/ over the iris, enabling real-time decisions about personal identity with extremely high confidence. The high confidence levels are important because they allow very large databases to be searched exhaustively (one-to-many ""identification mode"") without making false matches, despite so many chances.

Wireless sensor networks use battery-operated computing and sensing devices. A network of these devices will collaborate for a common application such as environmental monitoring. We expect sensor networks to be deployed in an ad hoc fashion, with nodes remaining largely inactive for long time, but becoming suddenly active when something is detected. These characteristics of sensor networks and applications motivate a MAC that is different from traditional wireless MACs such as IEEE 802.11 in several ways: energy conservation and self-configuration are primary goals, while per-node fairness and latency are less important. S-MAC uses a few novel techniques to reduce energy consumption and support self-configuration. It enables low-duty-cycle operation in a multihop network. Nodes form virtual clusters based on common sleep schedules to reduce control overhead and enable traffic-adaptive wake-up. S-MAC uses in-channel signaling to avoid overhearing unnecessary traffic. Finally, S-MAC applies message passing to reduce contention latency for applications that require in-network data processing. The paper presents measurement results of S-MAC performance on a sample sensor node, the UC Berkeley Mote, and reveals fundamental tradeoffs on energy, latency and throughput. Results show that S-MAC obtains significant energy savings compared with an 802.11-like MAC without sleeping.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2004.828953","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1306496","","Media Access Protocol;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Wireless sensor networks;Delay;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Communication system traffic control;Wireless application protocol;Access protocols;Computer networks","access protocols;wireless sensor networks;ad hoc networks;telecommunication signalling;message passing;wireless LAN","medium access control protocol;MAC protocol;coordinated adaptive sleeping;wireless sensor networks;battery-operated computing device;battery-operated sensing device;environmental monitoring;ad hoc networks;IEEE 802.11;energy conservation;self-configuration;multihop network;virtual clusters;in-channel signaling;message passing;in-network data processing;UC Berkeley Mote","","1729","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The effect of DG on coordination will depend on size, type, and placement of DG.

During controlled plantar flexion, a biomimetic torsional spring control is applied where orthotic joint stiffness is actively adjusted to minimize forefoot collisions with the ground. Throughout late stance, joint impedance is minimized so as not to impede powered plantar flexion movements, and during the swing phase, a torsional spring-damper control lifts the foot to provide toe clearance. To assess the clinical effects of variable-impedance control, kinetic and kinematic gait data were collected on two drop-foot participants wearing the AAFO. For each participant, zero, constant, and variable impedance control strategies were evaluated and the results were compared to the mechanics of three age, weight, and height matched normals. We find that actively adjusting joint impedance reduces the occurrence of slap foot allows greater powered plantar flexion and provides for less kinematic difference during swing when compared to normals. These results indicate that a variable-impedance orthosis may have certain clinical benefits for the treatment of drop-foot gait compared to conventional ankle-foot orthoses having zero or constant stiffness joint behaviors.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2003.823266","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1273519","","Adaptive control;Foot;Orthotics;Impedance;Kinematics;Muscles;Rehabilitation robotics;Medical treatment;Prosthetics;Knee","orthotics;electric impedance;gait analysis;biomimetics","adaptive control;variable-impedance ankle-foot orthosis;drop-foot gait;walking cycle;controlled plantar flexion;biomimetic torsional spring control;orthotic joint stiffness;forefoot collisions;swing phase;torsional spring-damper control;kinetic gait;kinematic gait","Aged;Ankle;Elasticity;Electric Impedance;Equipment Failure Analysis;Feedback;Female;Foot;Gait;Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Orthotic Devices;Prosthesis Design;Therapy, Computer-Assisted;Therapy, Computer-Assisted;Treatment Outcome","419","","49","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Initially, to efficiently control the local search and convergence to the global optimum solution, time-varying acceleration coefficients (TVAC) are introduced in addition to the time-varying inertia weight factor in particle swarm optimization (PSO). From the basis of TVAC, two new strategies are discussed to improve the performance of the PSO. First, the concept of ""mutation"" is introduced to the particle swarm optimization along with TVAC (MPSO-TVAC), by adding a small perturbation to a randomly selected modulus of the velocity vector of a random particle by predefined probability. Second, we introduce a novel particle swarm concept ""self-organizing hierarchical particle swarm optimizer with TVAC (HPSO-TVAC)"". Under this method, only the ""social"" part and the ""cognitive"" part of the particle swarm strategy are considered to estimate the new velocity of each particle and particles are reinitialized whenever they are stagnated in the search space. In addition, to overcome the difficulties of selecting an appropriate mutation step size for different problems, a time-varying mutation step size was introduced. Further, for most of the benchmarks, mutation probability is found to be insensitive to the performance of MPSO-TVAC method. On the other hand, the effect of reinitialization velocity on the performance of HPSO-TVAC method is also observed. Time-varying reinitialization step size is found to be an efficient parameter optimization strategy for HPSO-TVAC method. The HPSO-TVAC strategy outperformed all the methods considered in this investigation for most of the functions. Furthermore, it has also been observed that both the MPSO and HPSO strategies perform poorly when the acceleration coefficients are fixed at two.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2004.826071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1304846","","Particle swarm optimization;Acceleration;Optimization methods;Genetic mutations;Manufacturing;Power engineering and energy;Automation;Automatic control;Personnel;Scholarships","optimisation;parameter estimation","self-organizing hierarchical particle swarm optimizer;time-varying acceleration coefficients;parameter automation strategy;time-varying inertia weight factor;parameter estimation;internal combustion spark ignition engines","","1726","","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The aim is to develop a fuel-optimal control which is not relying on the a priori knowledge of the future driving conditions (global optimal control), but only upon the current system operation. The methodology developed is valid for those problem that are characterized by hard constraints on the state-battery state-of-charge (SOC) in this application-and by an arc cost-fuel consumption rate-which is not an explicit function of the state. A suboptimal control is found with a proper definition of a cost function to be minimized at each time instant. The ""instantaneous"" cost function includes the fuel energy and the electrical energy, the latter related to the state constraints.

The methodology relies on a parameterized prior that encourages models with few nonzero weights. In this paper, we adapt SBL to the signal processing problem of basis selection from overcomplete dictionaries, proving several results about the SBL cost function that elucidate its general behavior and provide solid theoretical justification for this application. Specifically, we have shown that SBL retains a desirable property of the /spl lscr//sub 0/-norm diversity measure (i.e., the global minimum is achieved at the maximally sparse solution) while often possessing a more limited constellation of local minima. We have also demonstrated that the local minima that do exist are achieved at sparse solutions. Later, we provide a novel interpretation of SBL that gives us valuable insight into why it is successful in producing sparse representations. Finally, we include simulation studies comparing sparse Bayesian learning with basis pursuit and the more recent FOCal Underdetermined System Solver (FOCUSS) class of basis selection algorithms. These results indicate that our theoretical insights translate directly into improved performance.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2004.831016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1315936","","Bayesian methods;Signal processing algorithms;Cost function;Iterative algorithms;Machine learning;Biomedical signal processing;Solids;Inverse problems;Support vector machines;Dictionaries","learning (artificial intelligence);iterative methods;inverse problems;signal representation;Bayes methods","sparse Bayesian learning;basis selection algorithms;relevance vector machines;machine learning;signal processing;basis pursuit;focal undetermined system solver;diversity measures;linear inverse problems;overcomplete dictionaries","","685","","64","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using ultrasonic focused beams, it is possible to remotely generate mechanical vibration sources radiating low-frequency, shear waves inside tissues. Relying on this concept, SSI proposes to create such a source and make it move at a supersonic speed. In analogy with the ""sonic boom"" created by a supersonic aircraft, the resulting shear waves will interfere constructively along a Mach cone, creating two intense plane shear waves. These waves propagate through the medium and are progressively distorted by tissue heterogeneities. An ultrafast scanner prototype is able to both generate this supersonic source and image (5000 frames/s) the propagation of the resulting shear waves. Using inversion algorithms, the shear elasticity of medium can be mapped quantitatively from this propagation movie. The SSI enables tissue elasticity mapping in less than 20 ms, even in strongly viscous medium like breast. Modalities such as shear compounding are implementable by tilting shear waves in different directions and improving the elasticity estimation. Results validating SSI in heterogeneous phantoms are presented. The first in vivo investigations made on healthy volunteers emphasize the potential clinical applicability of SSI for breast cancer detection.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2004.1295425","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1320804","","Biological tissues;Elasticity;Ultrasonic imaging;Visualization;Viscosity;Focusing;Vibrations;Aircraft manufacture;Prototypes;Motion pictures","biological tissues;biomechanics;cancer;medical image processing;elasticity;biomedical ultrasonics;viscoelasticity;shock waves;elastic waves;phantoms","supersonic shear imaging;soft tissue elasticity mapping;ultrasound based method;real time visualization;soft tissue viscoelastic properties;ultrasonic focused beams;mechanical vibration sources;supersonic speed;sonic boom;supersonic aircraft;Mach cone;tissue heterogeneities;ultrafast scanner prototype;supersonic source;supersonic image;shear elasticity;viscous medium;shear compounding;tilting shear waves;heterogeneous phantoms;breast cancer detection","Adult;Algorithms;Breast;Connective Tissue;Connective Tissue;Elasticity;Feasibility Studies;Female;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Phantoms, Imaging;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Shear Strength;Ultrasonography, Mammary;Ultrasonography, Mammary;Vibration","1437","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This method can be used in computer analyses of retinal images, e.g., in automated screening for diabetic retinopathy. The system is based on extraction of image ridges, which coincide approximately with vessel centerlines. The ridges are used to compose primitives in the form of line elements. With the line elements an image is partitioned into patches by assigning each image pixel to the closest line element. Every line element constitutes a local coordinate frame for its corresponding patch. For every pixel, feature vectors are computed that make use of properties of the patches and the line elements. The feature vectors are classified using a kNN-classifier and sequential forward feature selection. The algorithm was tested on a database consisting of 40 manually labeled images. The method achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.952. The method is compared with two recently published rule-based methods of Hoover et al. and Jiang et al. . The results show that our method is significantly better than the two rule-based methods (p<0.01).

Given the highly variable nature of batteries (e.g., 2.7-4.2 V for Li-ion), systems often require supply voltages to be both higher and lower than the battery voltage (e.g., power amplifier for CDMA applications), while supplying significant current, which is most efficiently generated by a noninverting buck-boost switching converter. In this paper, the design and experimental results of a new dynamic, noninverting, synchronous buck-boost converter for low voltage, portable applications is reported. The converter's output voltage is dynamically adjustable (on-the-fly) from 0.4 to 4.0 V, while capable of supplying a maximum load current of 0.65 A from an input supply of 2.4-3.4 V. The worst-case response time of the converter for a 0.4 to 4 V step change in its output voltage (corresponding to a 0.2 to 2 V step at its reference input) is less than 300 /spl mu/sec and to a load-current step of 0 to 0.5 A is within 200 /spl mu/sec, yielding only a transient error of 40 mV in the output voltage.

Interest in MEMS for biological applications (BioMEMS) is growing rapidly, with opportunities in areas such as biosensors, pacemakers, immunoisolation capsules, and drug delivery. The key to many of these applications lies in the leveraging of features unique to MEMS (for example, analyte sensitivity, electrical responsiveness, temporal control, and feature sizes similar to cells and organelles) for maximum impact. In this paper, we focus on how the biological integration of MEMS and other implantable devices can be improved through the application of microfabrication technology and concepts. Innovative approaches for improved physical and chemical integration of systems with the body are reviewed.

Specifically, small image patches in the lowand high-resolution images form manifolds with similar local geometry in two distinct feature spaces. As in LLE, local geometry is characterized by how a feature vector corresponding to a patch can be reconstructed by its neighbors in the feature space. Besides using the training image pairs to estimate the high-resolution embedding, we also enforce local compatibility and smoothness constraints between patches in the target high-resolution image through overlapping.

The realization of high-resolution Nyquist-rate converters becomes very expensive when the resolution exceeds 16 bits. The conventional delta-sigma (/spl Delta//spl Sigma/) structures used in telecommunication and audio applications usually cannot satisfy the requirements of high absolute accuracy and very small offset. The incremental (or integrating) converter provides a solution for such measurement applications, as it has most advantages of the /spl Delta//spl Sigma/ converter, yet is capable of offset-free and accurate conversion. In this paper, theoretical and practical aspects of higher order incremental converters are discussed.

This article, a synopsis of numerous contributions to the working group 4 of the wireless world research forum and other research work, presents an overview of important topics and applications in the context of relaying. It covers different approaches to exploiting the benefits of multihop communications via relays, such as solutions for radio range extension in mobile and wireless broadband cellular networks (trading range for capacity), and solutions to combat shadowing at high radio frequencies. Furthermore, relaying is presented as a means to reduce infrastructure deployment costs. It is also shown that through the exploitation of spatial diversity, multihop relaying can enhance capacity in cellular networks.

This control system is not based on the power system frequency and there is negligible contribution to the inertia of the power system. A DFIG control system was modified to introduce inertia response to the DFIG wind turbine.

Since many available Web services provide overlapping or identical functionality, albeit with different quality of service (QoS), a choice needs to be made to determine which services are to participate in a given composite service. This paper presents a middleware platform which addresses the issue of selecting Web services for the purpose of their composition in a way that maximizes user satisfaction expressed as utility functions over QoS attributes, while satisfying the constraints set by the user and by the structure of the composite service.

DSA refers to the analysis required to determine whether or not a power system can meet specified reliability and security criteria in both transient and steady-state time frames for all credible contingencies. Ensuring security in the new environment requires the use of advanced power system analysis tools capable of comprehensive security assessment with due consideration to practical operating criteria. These tools must be able to model the system appropriately, compute security limits in a fast and accurate manner, and provide meaningful displays to system operators. Online dynamics security assessment can provide the first line of defense against widespread system disturbances by quickly scanning the system for potential problems and providing operators with actionable results.

Finally, the determination of P and T wave peaks, onsets and ends is performed. We evaluated the algorithm on several manually annotated databases, such as MIT-BIH Arrhythmia, QT, European ST-T and CSE databases, developed for validation purposes. The QRS detector obtained a sensitivity of Se=99.66% and a positive predictivity of P+=99.56% over the first lead of the validation databases (more than 980,000 beats), while for the well-known MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, Se and P+ over 99.8% were attained. As for the delineation of the ECG waves, the mean and standard deviation of the differences between the automatic and manual annotations were computed. The mean error obtained with the WT approach was found not to exceed one sampling interval, while the standard deviations were around the accepted tolerances between expert physicians, outperforming the results of other well known algorithms, especially in determining the end of T wave.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2003.821031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1275572","","Electrocardiography;Databases;Detectors;Robustness;Communications technology;Standards development;Wavelet transforms;Sampling methods;Cardiac disease","electrocardiography;wavelet transforms;information services;medical signal processing;medical signal detection","wavelet-based ECG delineator;standard databases;robust single-lead electrocardiogram delineation system;wavelet transform;MIT-BIH arrhythmia database;QT database;European ST-T database;CSE database;mean deviation;standard deviation;automatic annotations;manual annotations;mean error;P wave;T wave","Algorithms;Arrhythmias, Cardiac;Databases, Factual;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electrocardiography;Heart Rate;Humans;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Prognosis;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","802","","48","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The operational concept of the EPLL is novel and based on a nonlinear dynamical system. As compared with the existing synchronization methods, the introduced EPLL-based synchronization method provides higher degree of immunity and insensitivity to noise, harmonics and other types of pollutions that exist in the signal used as the basis of synchronization. The salient feature of the EPLL-based synchronization method over conventional synchronization methods is its frequency adaptivity which permits satisfactory operation when the centre frequency of the base signal varies. The proposed EPLL-based method of synchronization is also capable of coping with the unbalanced system scenarios. Structural simplicity of the EPLL-based method greatly simplifies its implementation in digital software and/or hardware environments as an integral part of a digital control platform for power electronic converters. The primary application of the proposed synchronization method is for the distributed generation units, e.g., wind generation systems, which utilize power electronic converters as an integral part of their systems.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2004.831280","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1318659","","Power electronics;Pollution;Frequency synchronization;Phase locked loops;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Hardware;Digital control;Application software;Distributed control;Wind power generation","power convertors;phase locked loops;synchronisation;digital control;power engineering computing;nonlinear dynamical systems","power electronic converter;polluted environment;variable-frequency environment;synchronization method;phase-locked loop system;PLL system;nonlinear dynamical system;digital control platform","","360","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, a simple, intuitive, voltage divider model is introduced to analyze the PSR of linear regulators, from which design guidelines for obtaining high PSR performance are derived. The PSR of regulators that use PMOS output stages for low drop-out (LDO), crucial for modern low-voltage systems, is enhanced by error amplifiers which present a supply-correlated ripple at the gate of the PMOS pass device. On the other hand, amplifiers that suppress the supply ripple at their output are optimal for NMOS output stages since the source is now free from output ripple. A better PSR bandwidth, at the cost of dc PSR, can be obtained by interchanging the amplifiers in the two cases. It has also been proved that the dc PSR, its dominant frequency breakpoint (where performance starts to degrade), and three subsequent breakpoints are determined by the dc open-loop gain, error amplifier bandwidth, unity-gain frequency (UGF) of the system, output pole, and ESR zero, respectively. These results were verified with SPICE simulations using BSIM3 models for the TSMC 0.35 /spl mu/m CMOS process from MOSIS.","","0-7803-8445-8","10.1109/SOCC.2004.1362447","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1362447","","Regulators;Bandwidth;Frequency;Fluctuations;Rails;Power supplies;Working environment noise;Voltage;Power system modeling;Performance analysis","voltage regulators;voltage dividers;power supply circuits;system-on-chip;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;CMOS integrated circuits;monolithic integrated circuits;SPICE;low-power electronics","linear regulators;SoC applications;critical analog blocks;supply rail fluctuations;power supply rejection;PSR performance;SoC systems;voltage divider model;PMOS output stages;low drop-out;low-voltage systems;supply-correlated ripple;PMOS pass device;NMOS output stages;PSR bandwidth;frequency breakpoint;dc open-loop gain;error amplifier bandwidth;unity-gain frequency;ESR zero;SPICE simulations;BSIM3 models;CMOS process;MOSIS;0.35 micron","","103","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, its success relies on two considerations that have been often overlooked when investigating smart antenna technologies: first, the smart antennas features need to be considered early in the design phase of future systems (top-down compatibility); second, a realistic performance evaluation of smart antenna technique needs to be performed according to the critical parameters associated with future systems requirements (bottom-up feasibility). In this article an overview of the benefits of and most recent advances in smart antenna transceiver architecture is given first. Then the most important trends in the adoption of smart antennas in future system are presented, such as reconfigurability to varying channel propagation and network conditions, cross-layer optimization, and multi-user diversity, as well as challenges such as the design of a suitable simulation methodology and the accurate modeling of channel characteristics, interference, and implementation losses.

In this paper, the effects of gain, phase imbalance, and phase noise on EVM are examined. The work is focused on single-carrier, linear, and memoryless modulated signals, such as phase-shift keying and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). The EVM is calculated under the assumption that the transmitted signal consists of zero-mean uncorrelated inphase and quadrature components that are corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise. The contributions of this paper are as follows. First, an expression for the EVM is derived using a simple model that accounts for linear transmitter and receiver imperfections, inspired by the works of Cavers and Liao, 1993. Second, a union bound on the symbol error rate (SER) is derived. The root mean square EVM is shown to be independent of the constellation shape. The SER, however, is sensitive to the individual transmitted symbols and, therefore, the constellation shape. The resulting equations are used to examine the relation between EVM, sideband suppression, and phase noise.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2004.823477","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1275708","","Phase noise;Quadrature amplitude modulation;Vectors;Shape;Phase modulation;Amplitude modulation;Phase shift keying;Additive white noise;Transmitters;Error analysis","error analysis;phase noise;phase shift keying;quadrature amplitude modulation;AWGN channels;error statistics;transceivers","error vector magnitude;communication system performance;gain imbalance;phase imbalance;phase noise;single-carrier modulated signal;linear modulated signal;memoryless modulated signal;phase-shift keying;quadrature amplitude modulation;zero-mean uncorrelated inphase;additive white Gaussian noise channel;linear transmitter imperfections;linear receiver imperfections;symbol error rate;root mean square;constellation shape;sideband suppression","","152","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, it is also a difficult problem since the mining may have to generate or examine a combinatorially explosive number of intermediate subsequences. Most of the previously developed sequential pattern mining methods, such as GSP, explore a candidate generation-and-test approach [R. Agrawal et al. (1994)] to reduce the number of candidates to be examined. However, this approach may not be efficient in mining large sequence databases having numerous patterns and/or long patterns. In this paper, we propose a projection-based, sequential pattern-growth approach for efficient mining of sequential patterns. In this approach, a sequence database is recursively projected into a set of smaller projected databases, and sequential patterns are grown in each projected database by exploring only locally frequent fragments. Based on an initial study of the pattern growth-based sequential pattern mining, FreeSpan [J. Han et al. (2000)], we propose a more efficient method, called PSP, which offers ordered growth and reduced projected databases. To further improve the performance, a pseudoprojection technique is developed in PrefixSpan. A comprehensive performance study shows that PrefixSpan, in most cases, outperforms the a priori-based algorithm GSP, FreeSpan, and SPADE [M. Zaki, (2001)] (a sequential pattern mining algorithm that adopts vertical data format), and PrefixSpan integrated with pseudoprojection is the fastest among all the tested algorithms. Furthermore, this mining methodology can be extended to mining sequential patterns with user-specified constraints. The high promise of the pattern-growth approach may lead to its further extension toward efficient mining of other kinds of frequent patterns, such as frequent substructures.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2004.77","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1339268","Index Terms- Data mining algorithm;sequential pattern;frequent pattern;transaction database;sequence database;scalability;performance analysis.","Data mining;Sequences;Transaction databases;Pattern analysis;Association rules;Computer Society;Time factors;Application software;Explosives;Sequential analysis","data mining;very large databases;performance evaluation","sequential pattern mining;pattern-growth approach;prefixspan approach;data mining problem;sequence database;projected databases;FreeSpan;pseudoprojection technique;vertical data format;user-specified constraint;transaction database;performance analysis","","534","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to be transparent, the exoskeleton must determine the user's intent, apply forces when and where appropriate, and present low impedance to the wearer. We present a one degree of freedom exoskeleton called the RoboKnee which achieves a high level of transparency. User intent is determined through the knee joint angle and ground reaction forces. Torque is applied across the knee in order to allow the user's quadriceps muscles to relax. Low impedance is achieved through the use of series elastic actuators.

In this paper, we give a characterization of the energy functions that can be minimized by graph cuts. Our results are restricted to functions of binary variables. However, our work generalizes many previous constructions and is easily applicable to vision problems that involve large numbers of labels, such as stereo, motion, image restoration, and scene reconstruction. We give a precise characterization of what energy functions can be minimized using graph cuts, among the energy functions that can be written as a sum of terms containing three or fewer binary variables. We also provide a general-purpose construction to minimize such an energy function. Finally, we give a necessary condition for any energy function of binary variables to be minimized by graph cuts. Researchers who are considering the use of graph cuts to optimize a particular energy function can use our results to determine if this is possible and then follow our construction to create the appropriate graph.

In order to avoid overfitting, we employ objective estimation of the amount of Gaussian noise through Bayesian analysis of the true dimensionality of the data, i.e., the number of activation and non-Gaussian noise sources. This enables us to carry out probabilistic modeling and achieves an asymptotically unique decomposition of the data. It reduces problems of interpretation, as each final independent component is now much more likely to be due to only one physical or physiological process. We also describe other improvements to standard ICA, such as temporal prewhitening and variance normalization of timeseries, the latter being particularly useful in the context of dimensionality reduction when weak activation is present. We discuss the use of prior information about the spatiotemporal nature of the source processes, and an alternative-hypothesis testing approach for inference, using Gaussian mixture models. The performance of our approach is illustrated and evaluated on real and artificial FMRI data, and compared to the spatio-temporal accuracy of results obtained from classical ICA and GLM analyses.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2003.822821","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1263605","","Independent component analysis;Magnetic resonance imaging;Testing;Magnetic analysis;Gaussian noise;Signal analysis;Image analysis;Signal processing;Biomedical imaging;Noise reduction","biomedical MRI;medical image processing;independent component analysis;Gaussian noise;Bayes methods;spatiotemporal phenomena","probabilistic independent component analysis;functional magnetic resonance imaging;nonsquare mixing;Gaussian noise;Bayesian analysis;activation;probabilistic modeling;physiological process;temporal prewhitening;variance normalization;dimensionality reduction;spatiotemporal nature;alternative-hypothesis testing approach;general linear model","Algorithms;Brain;Cerebral Cortex;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Models, Neurological;Models, Statistical;Neurons;Phantoms, Imaging;Principal Component Analysis;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Stochastic Processes;Vision","1500","","49","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Performance analysis is important since segmentation algorithms often have limited accuracy and precision. Interactive drawing of the desired segmentation by human raters has often been the only acceptable approach, and yet suffers from intra-rater and inter-rater variability. Automated algorithms have been sought in order to remove the variability introduced by raters, but such algorithms must be assessed to ensure they are suitable for the task. The performance of raters (human or algorithmic) generating segmentations of medical images has been difficult to quantify because of the difficulty of obtaining or estimating a known true segmentation for clinical data. Although physical and digital phantoms can be constructed for which ground truth is known or readily estimated, such phantoms do not fully reflect clinical images due to the difficulty of constructing phantoms which reproduce the full range of imaging characteristics and normal and pathological anatomical variability observed in clinical data. Comparison to a collection of segmentations by raters is an attractive alternative since it can be carried out directly on the relevant clinical imaging data. However, the most appropriate measure or set of measures with which to compare such segmentations has not been clarified and several measures are used in practice. We present here an expectation-maximization algorithm for simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE). The algorithm considers a collection of segmentations and computes a probabilistic estimate of the true segmentation and a measure of the performance level represented by each segmentation. The source of each segmentation in the collection may be an appropriately trained human rater or raters, or may be an automated segmentation algorithm. The probabilistic estimate of the true segmentation is formed by estimating an optimal combination of the segmentations, weighting each segmentation depending upon the estimated performance level, and incorporating a prior model for the spatial distribution of structures being segmented as well as spatial homogeneity constraints. STAPLE is straightforward to apply to clinical imaging data, it readily enables assessment of the performance of an automated image segmentation algorithm, and enables direct comparison of human rater and algorithm performance.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2004.828354","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1309714","","Image segmentation;Biomedical imaging;Humans;Radiology;Hospitals;Imaging phantoms;Performance analysis;Computer science;Artificial intelligence;Pathology","medical image processing;image segmentation;phantoms;maximum likelihood estimation","ground truth;performance level estimation;image segmentation;intra-rater variability;inter-rater variability;medical images;physical phantoms;digital phantoms;expectation-maximization algorithm;spatial homogeneity constraints","Algorithms;Brain;Decision Making, Computer-Assisted;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Infant, Newborn;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Markov Chains;Models, Statistical;Observer Variation;Phantoms, Imaging;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","1002","","62","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Implementations of the DVR have been proposed at both a low voltage (LV) level, as well as a medium voltage (MV) level; and give an opportunity to protect high power sensitive loads from voltage sags. This paper reports practical test results obtained on a medium voltage (10 kV) level using a DVR at a distribution test facility in Kyndby, Denmark. The DVR was designed to protect a 400-kVA load from a 0.5-p.u. maximum voltage sag. The reported DVR verifies the use of a combined feed-forward and feed-back technique of the controller and it obtains both good transient and steady-state responses. The effect of the DVR on the system is experimentally investigated under both faulted and nonfaulted system states, for a variety of linear and nonlinear loads. Variable duration voltage sags were created using a controllable LV breaker fed by a 630 kVA distribution transformer placed upstream of the sensitive load. The fault currents in excess of 12 kA were designed and created to obtain the required voltage sags. It is concluded the DVR works well in all operating conditions.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2004.826504","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1296757","","Voltage control;Testing;Medium voltage;Power quality;Voltage fluctuations;Costs;Low voltage;Test facilities;Power system protection;Feedforward systems","voltage control;fault currents;feedforward;power supply quality;power distribution control;transient response;feedback;power transformers","dynamic voltage restorer;medium voltage level;voltage sags;low voltage level;high power sensitive loads;distribution test facility;feedforward technique;feedback technique;transient response;steady-state response;controllable LV breaker;distribution transformer;10 kV;630 kVA;400 kVA","","258","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to regularize solutions and keep the complexity of the algorithm bounded, we use a sequential sparsification process that admits into the kernel representation a new input sample only if its feature space image cannot be sufficiently well approximated by combining the images of previously admitted samples. This sparsification procedure allows the algorithm to operate online, often in real time.

A Bayesian framework that incorporates spectral, spatial, and temporal features to characterize the background appearance is proposed. Under this framework, the background is represented by the most significant and frequent features, i.e., the principal features , at each pixel. A Bayes decision rule is derived for background and foreground classification based on the statistics of principal features. Principal feature representation for both the static and dynamic background pixels is investigated. A novel learning method is proposed to adapt to both gradual and sudden ""once-off"" background changes. The convergence of the learning process is analyzed and a formula to select a proper learning rate is derived. Under the proposed framework, a novel algorithm for detecting foreground objects from complex environments is then established. It consists of change detection, change classification, foreground segmentation, and background maintenance.

The understanding of these systems is often simplified by considering both the signals and system transfer functions as ""complex"" quantities. The complex approach is especially useful in highly integrated multistandard receivers where the use of narrow-band fixed-coefficient filters at the RF and high IF must be minimized. This paper first presents a tutorial review of complex signal processing for wireless applications. The review emphasizes a graphical and pictorial description rather than an equation-based approach. Next, a number of classical modulation architectures are described using this formulation. Finally, more recent developments such as complex filters, image-reject mixers, low-IF receivers, and oversampling analog-digital converters are discussed.","1558-0806","","10.1109/TCSI.2004.834522","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1333231","","Signal processing;Mixers;Low pass filters;Local area networks;Transceivers;Transfer functions;Narrowband;Radio frequency;Equations;Image converters","mobile communication;signal processing;filters;analogue-digital conversion;radio receivers;mixers (circuits);interference (signal);frequency modulation","complex signal processing;wireless systems;quadrature signal pair relationship;out-of-band signal;in-band signal;system transfer functions;integrated multistandard receivers;narrow-band fixed-coefficient filters;graphical description;pictorial description;classical modulation architectures;complex filters;image-reject mixers;low-IF receivers;oversampling analog-digital converters;communication systems;frequency modulation;wireless receivers","","143","","54","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We present PeerTrust - a reputation-based trust supporting framework, which includes a coherent adaptive trust model for quantifying and comparing the trustworthiness of peers based on a transaction-based feedback system, and a decentralized implementation of such a model over a structured P2P network. PeerTrust model has two main features. First, we introduce three basic trust parameters and two adaptive factors in computing trustworthiness of peers, namely, feedback a peer receives from other peers, the total number of transactions a peer performs, the credibility of the feedback sources, transaction context factor, and the community context factor. Second, we define a general trust metric to combine these parameters. Other contributions of the paper include strategies used for implementing the trust model in a decentralized P2P environment, evaluation mechanisms to validate the effectiveness and cost of PeerTrust model, and a set of experiments that show the feasibility and benefit of our approach.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2004.1318566","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1318566","","Peer to peer computing;Feedback;Communities;Costs;Electronic commerce;Consumer electronics;Computer Society;Data security;Information security;Computer applications","security of data;computer networks;electronic commerce;transaction processing","trust model;reputation mechanism;data management;security;peer-to-peer electronic communities;transaction-based feedback system;P2P network","","1095","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, we have developed techniques for discovering workflow models. The starting point for such techniques is a so-called ""workflow log"" containing information about the workflow process as it is actually being executed. We present a new algorithm to extract a process model from such a log and represent it in terms of a Petri net.

The results show that some optimization scenarios are better suited to one method versus the other (i.e., particle swarm optimization performs better in some cases while genetic algorithms perform better in others), which implies that the two methods traverse the problem hyperspace differently.

We validate our theory by comparing its predictions with first-principles finite-difference time-domain simulations and obtaining excellent agreement between the two.","1558-1713","","10.1109/JQE.2004.834773","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337032","","Optical resonators;Optical coupling;Optical losses;Optical filters;Interference;Resonator filters;Resonance;Laser modes;Laser noise;Laser theory","coupled mode analysis;optical resonators;light interference;finite difference time-domain analysis;photonic crystals","temporal coupled-mode theory;nonorthogonal modes;multimode cavities;multimode optical resonators;Fano interference;transport properties;first-principles finite-difference time-domain simulations","","270","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This notion represents the coexistence of two mobile radio systems within the same frequency range. It enables the secondary utilization of already licensed frequency bands as aimed at by several regulatory authorities worldwide. The goal of spectrum pooling is to enhance spectral efficiency by overlaying a new mobile radio system on an existing one without requiring any changes to the actual licensed system. Several demanding tasks originate from this idea. Some of them have been solved in recent research projects. Others are subject to ongoing investigations. Here, the state of the art in spectrum pooling is presented.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2004.1273768","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1273768","","Transceivers;Radio communication;Frequency division multiplexing;Frequency modulation;OFDM modulation;Physical layer;Multiaccess communication;Frequency division multiaccess;GSM;Packet radio networks","frequency allocation;mobile radio;Internet;radiofrequency interference;synchronisation;scheduling","spectrum pooling;spectrum efficiency enhancement;mobile radio system;frequency band;regulatory authorities;ubiquitous wireless access;Internet;spectrum allocation;mutual interference;synchronization;MAC layer;handoff algorithms;scheduling algorithms","","888","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The desire to place engine control units on the engine and transmission control units either on or in the transmission will push the ambient temperature above 125/spl deg/C. However, extreme cost pressures, increasing reliability demands (10 year/241 350 km) and the cost of field failures (recalls, liability, customer loyalty) will make the shift to higher temperatures occur incrementally. The coolest spots on engine and in the transmission will be used. These large bodies do provide considerable heat sinking to reduce temperature rise due to power dissipation in the control unit. The majority of near term applications will be at 150/spl deg/C or less and these will be worst case temperatures, not nominal. The transition to X-by-wire technology, replacing mechanical and hydraulic systems with electromechanical systems will require more power electronics. Integration of power transistors and smart power devices into the electromechanical actuator will require power devices to operate at 175/spl deg/C to 200/spl deg/C. Hybrid electric vehicles and fuel cell vehicles will also drive the demand for higher temperature power electronics. In the case of hybrid electric and fuel cell vehicles, the high temperature will be due to power dissipation. The alternates to high-temperature devices are thermal management systems which add weight and cost. Finally, the number of sensors in vehicles is increasing as more electrically controlled systems are added. Many of these sensors must work in high-temperature environments. The harshest applications are exhaust gas sensors and cylinder pressure or combustion sensors. High-temperature electronics use in automotive systems will continue to grow, but it will be gradual as cost and reliability issues are addressed. This work examines the motivation for higher temperature operation, the packaging limitations even at 125/spl deg/C with newer package styles and concludes with a review of challenges at both the semiconductor device and packaging level as temperatures push beyond 125/spl deg/C.","1558-0822","","10.1109/TEPM.2004.843109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1393072","Automotive;extreme-environment electronics","Automotive engineering;Costs;Engines;Temperature control;Temperature sensors;Semiconductor device packaging;Power dissipation;Power electronics;Fuel cell vehicles;Gas detectors","automotive electronics;power semiconductor devices;high-temperature electronics;semiconductor device packaging;thermal management (packaging);heat sinks;reliability","high-temperature electronics;underhood automotive environment;automotive electronics industry;electronic components;engine control units;transmission control units;heat sink;X-by-wire technology;electromechanical systems;power electronics;power transistors;smart power devices;electromechanical actuator;hybrid electric vehicles;fuel cell vehicles;thermal management systems;electrically controlled systems;exhaust gas sensors;cylinder pressure sensors;combustion sensors;semiconductor device packaging;175 to 200 degC","","402","","39","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This enhancement, however, is limited by the distortion originated from the combined influence of g/sub m/' and harmonic feedback, which can greatly be reduced by the cascoding MGTR output for the amplifier and by the tuned load for the mixer.

However, the high initial investment impedes its wide commercialization. This paper proposes a cost-effective single-stage inverter with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) in combination with one-cycle control (OCC) for photovoltaic power generation. This control scheme is based on the output current-adjusting feature of OCC. The output current of the inverter can be adjusted according to the voltage of the photovoltaic (PV) array so as to extract the maximum power from it. In the mean time, OCC guarantees that the output current is proportional and in phase with the grid voltage. All these are accomplished in one power stage and a simple control circuit. No detection and calculation of power are needed. Compared with previously proposed approaches, this method is much more efficient and cost-effective and yet exhibits excellent performance. The principle is explained qualitatively and extensive experiments have been carried out to verify the proposed method.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2004.833458","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1331490","","Inverters;Solar power generation;Photovoltaic systems;Voltage;Renewable energy resources;Solar energy;Investments;Impedance;Commercialization;Circuits","invertors;renewable energy sources;solar power stations;photovoltaic power systems;power generation control","single-stage inverter;maximum power point tracking;renewable energy;solar energy;one-cycle control;photovoltaic power generation;grid voltage;grid connected inverters","","202","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We introduce here the concept of approximate W-disjoint orthogonality and present experimental results demonstrating the level of approximate W-disjoint orthogonality of speech in mixtures of various orders. The results demonstrate that there exist ideal binary time-frequency masks that can separate several speech signals from one mixture. While determining these masks blindly from just one mixture is an open problem, we show that we can approximate the ideal masks in the case where two anechoic mixtures are provided. Motivated by the maximum likelihood mixing parameter estimators, we define a power weighted two-dimensional (2-D) histogram constructed from the ratio of the time-frequency representations of the mixtures that is shown to have one peak for each source with peak location corresponding to the relative attenuation and delay mixing parameters. The histogram is used to create time-frequency masks that partition one of the mixtures into the original sources. Experimental results on speech mixtures verify the technique.

They are a cheaper alternative to manned vehicles, and are ideally suited for dangerous or monotonous missions that would be inadvisable for a human pilot. Groups of UAV are of special interest for their abilities to coordinate simultaneous coverage of large areas, or cooperate to achieve goals such as mapping. Cooperation and coordination in UAV groups also allows increasingly large numbers of aircraft to be operated by a single user. Specific applications under consideration for groups of cooperating UAV are border patrol, search and rescue, surveillance, communications relaying, and mapping of hostile territory. The capabilities of small UAV continue to grow with advances in wireless communications and computing power. Accordingly, research topics in cooperative UAV control include efficient computer vision for real-time navigation and networked computing and communication strategies for distributed control, as well as traditional aircraft-related topics such as collision avoidance and formation flight. Emerging results in cooperative UAV control are presented via discussion of these topics, including particular requirements, challenges, and some promising strategies relating to each area.

The visual cues employed characterize eyelid movement, gaze movement, head movement, and facial expression. A probabilistic model is developed to model human fatigue and to predict fatigue based on the visual cues obtained. The simultaneous use of multiple visual cues and their systematic combination yields a much more robust and accurate fatigue characterization than using a single visual cue.

One possibility is to use multiple antennas at base stations and terminals to get very high spectral efficiencies in rich scattering environments. Such multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) channels can then be used in conjunction with scheduling and rate-feedback algorithms to further increase channel throughput. This paper provides an analysis of the expected gains due to scheduling and bits needed for rate feedback. Our analysis requires an accurate approximation of the distribution of the MIMO channel mutual information. Because the exact distribution of the mutual information in a Rayleigh-fading environment is difficult to analyze, we prove a central limit theorem for MIMO channels with a large number of antennas. While the growth in average mutual information (capacity) of a MIMO channel with the number of antennas is well understood, it turns out that the variance of the mutual information can grow very slowly or even shrink as the number of antennas grows. We discuss implications of this ""channel-hardening"" result for data and voice services, scheduling, and rate feedback.

Ben-Ezra","NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","","2004","26","6","689","698","Motion blur due to camera motion can significantly degrade the quality of an image. Since the path of the camera motion can be arbitrary, deblurring of motion blurred images is a hard problem. Previous methods to deal with this problem have included blind restoration of motion blurred images, optical correction using stabilized lenses, and special CMOS sensors that limit the exposure time in the presence of motion. In this paper, we exploit the fundamental trade off between spatial resolution and temporal resolution to construct a hybrid camera that can measure its own motion during image integration. The acquired motion information is used to compute a point spread function (PSF) that represents the path of the camera during integration. This PSF is then used to deblur the image. To verify the feasibility of hybrid imaging for motion deblurring, we have implemented a prototype hybrid camera. This prototype system was evaluated in different indoor and outdoor scenes using long exposures and complex camera motion paths. The results show that, with minimal resources, hybrid imaging outperforms previous approaches to the motion blur problem. We conclude with a brief discussion on how our ideas can be extended beyond the case of global camera motion to the case where individual objects in the scene move with different velocities.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2004.1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1288519","Sharpening and deblurring;inverse filtering;motion;motion blur;point spread function;resolution;hybrid imaging.","Cameras;Optical sensors;CMOS image sensors;Spatial resolution;Optical imaging;Prototypes;Layout;Degradation;Image restoration;Lenses","motion estimation;image restoration;CMOS image sensors;image resolution;optical information processing","motion based motion deblurring;camera motion;hard problem;blind restoration;optical correction;stabilized lenses;CMOS sensors;spatial resolution;temporal resolution;hybrid camera;image integration;motion information;point spread function;outdoor scenes;indoor scenes","Algorithms;Artifacts;Artificial Intelligence;Feasibility Studies;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Motion;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photography;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","288","","46","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The bandstop filter is implemented by using a coupled-serial-shunted line structure, while the wide-band bandpass filter is constructed by using a serial-shunted line configuration. In particular, the bandwidth of each passband of the dual-band filter is controllable by adjusting the characteristics of both the bandpass filter and bandstop filter.

Among the several factors that affect the efficiency of the matching layer, the importance of attenuation is pointed out. A standard characterization procedure is applied to a wide collection of candidate materials to produce matching layers. In particular, some types of filtration membranes are studied. From these results, the best materials are identified, and the better matching configuration is proposed. Four pairs of air-coupled piezoelectric transducers also are produced to illustrate the performance of the proposed solution. The lowest two-way insertion loss figure is -24 dB obtained at 0.45 MHz.

Typically, the interface between the grid and rectifier is either an inductor or an LCL-filter. The use of an LCL-filter mitigates the switching ripple injected in the grid by a three-phase active rectifier. However, stability problems can arise in the current control loop. In order to overcome them, a damping resistor can be inserted, at the price of a reduction of efficiency. The use of active damping by means of control may seem attractive but it is often limited by the use of more sensors compared to the standard control and also by a complex tuning procedure of the controllers. This paper introduces a new active damping method that does not require the use of more sensors. It consists of adding a filter on the reference voltage for the modulator. The tuning process of this filter is easily done, for a wide range of sampling frequencies, with the use of genetic algorithms. This method is used only for the optimum choice of the parameters in the filter and an on-line implementation is not needed. Thus the resulting active damping solution does not need new sensors or complex calculations. Moreover, in the paper particular attention is devoted to the susceptibility of the system in a high polluting environment.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2003.820540","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1262055","","Genetics;Algorithm design and analysis;Damping;Rectifiers;Filters;Power system stability;Tuning;Inverters;Inductors;Current control","genetic algorithms;damping;electric current control;invertors;power filters;rectifying circuits;stability","genetic algorithm;active damping;LCL-filter;three-phase active rectifier;regenerative systems;distributed power system;current control loop;stability problems;damping resistor;inverter;modulator","","273","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we examine the basic building block of cooperative diversity systems, a simple fading relay channel where the source, destination, and relay terminals are each equipped with single antenna transceivers. We consider three different time-division multiple-access-based cooperative protocols that vary the degree of broadcasting and receive collision. The relay terminal operates in either the amplify-and-forward (AF) or decode-and-forward (DF) modes. For each protocol, we study the ergodic and outage capacity behavior (assuming Gaussian code books) under the AF and DF modes of relaying. We analyze the spatial diversity performance of the various protocols and find that full spatial diversity (second-order in this case) is achieved by certain protocols provided that appropriate power control is employed. Our analysis unifies previous results reported in the literature and establishes the superiority (both from a capacity, as well as a diversity point-of-view) of a new protocol proposed in this paper. The second part of the paper is devoted to (distributed) space-time code design for fading relay channels operating in the AF mode. We show that the corresponding code design criteria consist of the traditional rank and determinant criteria for the case of colocated antennas, as well as appropriate power control rules. Consequently space-time codes designed for the case of colocated multiantenna channels can be used to realize cooperative diversity provided that appropriate power control is employed.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2004.830922","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1321222","","Fading;Relays;Signal design;Protocols;Power control;Space time codes;Transmitting antennas;Antenna arrays;Diversity methods;Transceivers","fading channels;relays;space-time codes;antenna arrays;diversity reception;transceivers;time division multiple access;protocols;power control;broadcast channels;broadcast antennas;broadcasting","fading relay channel;space-time signal design cooperative diversity;multiple antenna terminal;virtual antenna array;spatial diversity gain;single antenna transceiver;time-division multiple-access protocol;broadcasting;receive collision;relay terminal;amplify-forward mode;decode-forward mode;power control;space-time code design;colocated multiantenna channel","","1414","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, various transmission lines are fabricated on different LCP substrate thicknesses and the loss characteristics are given in decibels per centimeter from 2 to 110 GHz. Peak transmission-line losses at 110 GHz vary between 0.88-2.55 dB/cm, depending on the line type and geometry. These results show, for the first time, that LCP has excellent dielectric properties for applications extending through millimeter-wave frequencies.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2004.825738","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1284807","","Liquid crystal polymers;Crystalline materials;Transmission lines;Dielectric loss measurement;Dielectric substrates;Dielectric materials;Millimeter wave technology;Frequency;Dielectric measurements;Transmission line measurements","liquid crystal polymers;transmission lines;packaging;microstrip resonators;cavity resonators;millimetre wave measurement;dielectric measurement;dielectric materials;dielectric losses;permittivity","liquid crystal polymer substrate;transmission lines loss;microwave substrate;packaging material;electrical properties;cavity resonators;microstrip ring resonator;dielectric constant;dielectric loss tangent;dielectric properties;30 to 110 GHz","","371","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The new concept stands out due to its stringent modular construction as well as its extremely good control characteristics. This new M/sup 2/LC concept is well suitable for a wide range of high voltage applications. The basic working principle as well as the static and dynamic behaviour is explained in detail on a single-phase AC/AC-converter enabling four-quadrant operation. The M/sup 2/LC-family has already been introduced and examined for applications like traction converters, operating directly on the power line, and network interties [Marquardt, R et al., 2003 and Lesnicar, A et al., 2002]. With this prototype converter system, the characteristics of various different M/sup 2/LC-topologies can be investigated, including single or three phase DC/AC converters as well as multiphase AC/AC converters. The prototype converter has been designed in such a way that its configuration can be quickly changed between wide ranges of topologies. A flexible control system has been implemented, which is capable of controlling up to 32 IGBTs per converter arm, independently. Next to the presentation of the converter and its control system, measurement results are presented including converter operation.","0275-9306","0-7803-8399-0","10.1109/PESC.2004.1355234","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1355234","","Prototypes;Voltage;Arm;Topology;Inverters;Control systems;Capacitors;Centralized control;Power electronics;Insulated gate bipolar transistors","AC-AC power convertors;DC-AC power convertors;insulated gate bipolar transistors","multiphase modular-multilevel-converter prototype;power rating;single-phase AC-AC-converter;four-quadrant operation;traction converters;power line;three phase DC-AC converter;multiphase AC-AC converter;IGBT control;2 MW","","132","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has now been slightly more than 25 years since the 1978 seminal paper of Bennett and Ross, which summarized UWB's early applications. It thus seems appropriate, given the tremendous increase in interest in the technology since the Federal Communications Commission modified its Part 15 rules to accommodate UWB transmissions, to take a look at more recent system applications of this unique technology. This paper provides a brief historical perspective of UWB, discusses recent techniques for the generation and reception of short-pulse electromagnetic waveforms, and examines a number of recently developed UWB systems in the communications, radar, and precision-positioning fields. Finally, a brief assessment of future trends for the technology is provided.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2004.834186","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1327870","","Ultra wideband technology;Ultra wideband radar;FCC;Radar cross section;Time domain analysis;Electromagnetic propagation;Radar applications;Paper technology;Appropriate technology;Transient analysis","time-domain analysis;radiowave propagation;radio equipment;radar equipment;military radar;broadband networks","short-pulse ultra-wideband technology;time-domain electromagnetics;electromagnetic-wave propagation;historical perspective;short-pulse electromagnetic waveforms;precision-positioning fields;radar","","443","","43","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Phase-noise reduction due to range correlation was experimentally evaluated, and the measured residual phase noise was within 5 dB of predicted values on average. In a direct-conversion receiver, the phase relationship between the received signal and the local oscillator has a significant effect on the demodulation sensitivity, and the null points can be avoided with a quadrature (I/Q) receiver.

The correlation is primarily caused by mutual coupling between the elements of the antenna arrays on both the receiving and transmitting sides. Similarly, diversity antennas can be characterized by a diversity gain that also is affected by mutual coupling between the antennas. We explain how such MIMO and diversity antennas with mutual coupling can be analyzed by classical embedded element patterns that can be computed by standard computer codes. In the MIMO example under investigation, the mutual coupling reduces both correlation, which increases the capacity, and radiation efficiency, which decreases it, and the combined effect is a net capacity reduction. We also explain how the radiation efficiency, diversity gain, correlation, and channel capacity can be measured in a reverberation chamber.

In this study, a novel approach to prepare magnetic polymeric nanoparticles with magnetic core and polymeric shell using inverse microemulsion polymerization process is reported. Poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG)-modified superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles with specific shape and size have been prepared inside the aqueous cores of AOT/n-Hexane reverse micelles and characterized by various physicochemical means such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), infrared spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), and ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy. The inverse microemulsion polymerization of a polymerizable derivative of PEG and a cross-linking agent resulted in a stable hydrophilic polymeric shell of the nanoparticles. The results taken together from TEM and AFM studies showed that the particles are spherical in shape with core-shell structure. The average size of the PEG-modified nanoparticles was found to be around 40-50 nm with narrow size distribution. The magnetic measurement studies revealed the superparamagnetic behavior of the nanoparticles with saturation magnetization values between 45-50 electromagnetic units per gram.

Since the sensors are power-constrained devices, the data is typically fused en route, and an aggregated report of fused information is finally available at the sink. It is important that information from as many sensors as possible be fused in order to increase the credibility of the aggregated report. However, in sensor networks there may be faulty sensors or even malicious intruders that generate and report misleading information. Thus, it is important to collect and fuse enough correct reports that agree with each other; this would enable nodes that perform fusion to detect and ignore the effects of the faulty reports. In this work, we propose a protocol called corroborative aggregation protocol (CAP), in which, each sensor that detects a report from its neighbor that contradicts its own findings generates its own report to dispute the faulty report. The idea is to increase the number of correct reports so as to effectively reduce the adverse effects of faulty reports. We show by simulations that CAP is effective in maintaining the credibility of the final fused content even if approximately 30% of sensors within a detecting zone are wrong about an event.","","0-7803-8623-X","10.1109/ISCC.2004.1358408","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1358408","","Intelligent networks;Wireless sensor networks;Sensor fusion;Event detection;Fuses;Protocols;Network servers;Fault detection;Computer network reliability;Computer science","sensor fusion;wireless sensor networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network reliability;protocols","network reliability;event report;wireless sensor network;sensor data;central server;power-constrained device;data fusion;network route;faulty sensor;fusion detection;faulty report;corroborative aggregation protocol","","2","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed system automatically synthesizes simple problem-specific feature extractors from a training set of face and nonface patterns, without making any assumptions or using any hand-made design concerning the features to extract or the areas of the face pattern to analyze. The face detection procedure acts like a pipeline of simple convolution and subsampling modules that treat the raw input image as a whole. We therefore show that an efficient face detection system does not require any costly local preprocessing before classification of image areas. The proposed scheme provides very high detection rate with a particularly low level of false positives, demonstrated on difficult test sets, without requiring the use of multiple networks for handling difficult cases. We present extensive experimental results illustrating the efficiency of the proposed approach on difficult test sets and including an in-depth sensitivity analysis with respect to the degrees of variability of the face patterns.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2004.97","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1335446","Index Terms- Face detection;neural networks;machine learning;convolutional networks.","Face detection;Robustness;Feature extraction;Testing;Convolutional codes;Pattern analysis;Pipelines;Convolution;Neural networks;Humans","face recognition;image classification;feature extraction;neural net architecture;image sampling;learning (artificial intelligence)","convolutional face finder;convolutional neural architecture;face pattern detection;complex real world images;specific feature extractors;training set;face patterns;nonface patterns;hand made design;subsampling modules;convolution modules;image classification;sensitivity analysis","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Automatic Data Processing;Cluster Analysis;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Handwriting;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reading;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique;User-Computer Interface","320","","39","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An overview is given of the necessary changes, including time and frequency synchronization, channel estimation, synchronization tracking, and MIMO detection. As a test case, the OFDM-based wireless local area network (WLAN) standard IEEE 802.11a is considered, but the results are applicable more generally. The complete MIMO OFDM processing is implemented in a system with three transmit and three receive antennas, and its performance is evaluated with both simulations and experimental test results. Results from measurements with this MIMO OFDM system in a typical office environment show, on average, a doubling of the system throughput, compared with a single antenna OFDM system.

Islanding operations of DG usually occur when power supply from the main utility is interrupted due to several reasons but the DG keeps supplying power into the distribution networks. These kinds of islanding conditions cause negative impacts on protection, operation, and management of distribution systems; therefore, it is necessary to effectively detect the islanding conditions and swiftly disconnect DG from distribution network. Generally, if there are large changes in loading for DG after loss of the main power supply, then islanding conditions are easily detected by monitoring several parameters: voltage magnitude, phase displacement, and frequency change. However, in case of small changes in loading for DG, the conventional methods have some difficulty in detecting such a particular islanding condition. This paper presents a new islanding detection algorithm for DG effectively working in the most of DG loading conditions. This paper proposes two new parameters for detecting islanding operation of DG: voltage unbalance and total harmonic distortion of current. The proposed method effectively combines the conventional parameters with the newly proposed parameters for detecting the islanding conditions. The proposed methods were verified using the radial distribution network of IEEE 34 bus.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2003.822964","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1278435","","Distributed control;Voltage;Total harmonic distortion;Power supplies;Power system protection;Power system management;Phase detection;Phase frequency detector;Condition monitoring;Detection algorithms","power distribution reliability;power system harmonics;power system interconnection;harmonic distortion","islanding detection method;distributed generations;voltage unbalance;current total harmonic distortion;power supply;distribution networks;voltage magnitude;phase displacement;IEEE 34 bus;radial distribution network;harmonic distortion","","315","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is a fast tracking algorithm, where an initial approximation of maximum power point is (MPP) quickly achieved using a variable step-size. Subsequently, the exact maximum power point can be targeted using any conventional method like the hill-climbing or incremental conductance method. Thus, the drawback of a fixed small step-size over the entire tracking range is removed, resulting in reduced number of iterations and much faster tracking compared to conventional methods. The strength of the algorithm comes from the fact that instead of tracking power, which does not have a one-to-one relationship with duty cycle, it tracks an intermediate variable /spl beta/, which has a monotonically increasing, one-to-one relationship. The algorithm has been verified on a photovoltaic system modeled in Matlab-Simulink software. The algorithm significantly improves the efficiency during the tracking phase as compared to a conventional algorithm. It is especially suitable for fast changing environmental conditions. The proposed algorithm can be implemented on any fast controller such as the digital signal processor.

Information obtained by the monitoring nodes needs to be routed to a set of designated gateway nodes. In these networks, every node is capable of sensing, data processing, and communication, and operates on its limited amount of battery energy consumed mostly in transmission and reception at its radio transceiver. If we assume that the transmitter power level can be adjusted to use the minimum energy required to reach the intended next hop receiver then the energy consumption rate per unit information transmission depends on the choice of the next hop node, i.e., the routing decision. We formulate the routing problem as a linear programming problem, where the objective is to maximize the network lifetime, which is equivalent to the time until the network partition due to battery outage. Two different models are considered for the information-generation processes. One assumes constant rates and the other assumes an arbitrary process. A shortest cost path routing algorithm is proposed which uses link costs that reflect both the communication energy consumption rates and the residual energy levels at the two end nodes. The algorithm is amenable to distributed implementation. Simulation results with both information-generation process models show that the proposed algorithm can achieve network lifetime that is very close to the optimal network lifetime obtained by solving the linear programming problem.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2004.833122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1331424","","Routing;Wireless sensor networks;Monitoring;Batteries;Energy consumption;Linear programming;Costs;Mobile ad hoc networks;Sensor systems;Data processing","telecommunication network routing;wireless sensor networks;ad hoc networks;telecommunication power supplies;transceivers;linear programming;telecommunication traffic","maximum lifetime routing;wireless sensor networks;wireless ad hoc networks;monitoring system;radio transceiver;routing decision;linear programming;network battery outage;shortest cost path routing algorithm;energy consumption;residual energy levels;information-generation process model;energy-sensitive routing;power-aware routing;flow augmentation algorithm;iterative methods;traffic flow","","826","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Each inverter supplies a current that is the result of the voltage difference between a reference AC voltage source and the grid voltage across a virtual impedance with real and/or imaginary parts. The reference AC voltage source is synchronised with the grid, with a phase shift, depending on the difference between nominal and real grid frequency. A detailed analysis show that this approach has superior behaviour in comparison with the existing droop control methods, considering the mitigation of voltage harmonics, short-circuit behaviour and, in the case of a non-negligible line resistance, the 'efficient' control of frequency and voltage.

To suggest what prompted the invention of the term cepstrum, this article narrates the historical and mathematical background that led to its discovery. The computations of earlier simple echo representations have shown that the spectrum representation domain results does not belong in the frequency or time domain. Bogert et al. (1963) chose to refer to it as quefrency domain and later termed the spectrum of the log of a time waveform as the cepstrum. The article also recounts the analysis of Al Oppenheim in relation to the cepstrum. It was in his theory for nonlinear signal processing, referred to as homomorphic systems, that the realization of the characteristic system of homomorphic convolution was reminiscent of the cepstrum. To retain both the relationship to the work of Bogart et al. and the distinction, the term power cepstrum was eventually applied to the nonlinear mapping in homomorphic deconvolution . While most of the terms in the glossary have faded into the background, the term cepstrum has survived and has become part of the digital signal processing lexicon.","1558-0792","","10.1109/MSP.2004.1328092","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1328092","","Cepstrum;Frequency;History;Cepstral analysis;Convolution;Speech processing;Speech recognition;Nonlinear distortion;Signal processing;Deconvolution","signal processing;cepstral analysis","log spectrum;convolutional distortions;cepstrum;time waveform;nonlinear signal processing;homomorphic systems;digital signal processing lexicon","","157","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Therefore, we aim to 1) review known methodology for doing human factors research, with specific emphasis on visualization, 2) review current human factors research in visualization to provide a basis for future investigation, and 3) identify promising areas for future research.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2004.1260759","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1260759","","Human factors;Data visualization;Terminology;Data analysis;Geographic Information Systems;Decision making;Research initiatives;Biomedical imaging;Fluid flow;Medical simulation","data visualisation;data analysis;decision making;human factors;visual perception;cognition","human factors;visualization;data analysis;decision making task;research initiatives;perception;cognitive support","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Human Engineering;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Online Systems;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Research;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;User-Computer Interface;Visual Perception","202","","82","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Gazebo is designed to fill this niche by creating a 3D dynamic multi-robot environment capable of recreating the complex worlds that would be encountered by the next generation of mobile robots. Its open source status, fine grained control, and high fidelity place Gazebo in a unique position to become more than just a stepping stone between the drawing board and real hardware: data visualization, simulation of remote environments, and even reverse engineering of blackbox systems are all possible applications.

Elucidating the patterns hidden in gene expression data offers a tremendous opportunity for an enhanced understanding of functional genomics. However, the large number of genes and the complexity of biological networks greatly increases the challenges of comprehending and interpreting the resulting mass of data, which often consists of millions of measurements. A first step toward addressing this challenge is the use of clustering techniques, which is essential in the data mining process to reveal natural structures and identify interesting patterns in the underlying data. Cluster analysis seeks to partition a given data set into groups based on specified features so that the data points within a group are more similar to each other than the points in different groups. A very rich literature on cluster analysis has developed over the past three decades. Many conventional clustering algorithms have been adapted or directly applied to gene expression data, and also new algorithms have recently been proposed specifically aiming at gene expression data. These clustering algorithms have been proven useful for identifying biologically relevant groups of genes and samples. In this paper, we first briefly introduce the concepts of microarray technology and discuss the basic elements of clustering on gene expression data. In particular, we divide cluster analysis for gene expression data into three categories. Then, we present specific challenges pertinent to each clustering category and introduce several representative approaches. We also discuss the problem of cluster validation in three aspects and review various methods to assess the quality and reliability of clustering results. Finally, we conclude this paper and suggest the promising trends in this field.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2004.68","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1339264","Index Terms- Microarray technology;gene expression data;clustering.","Gene expression;Clustering algorithms;DNA;Monitoring;Biological processes;Genomics;Bioinformatics;Data mining;Data analysis;Partitioning algorithms","genetics;DNA;pattern clustering;data mining;biology computing","cluster analysis;gene expression data;DNA microarray technology;expression level;biological process;genomics;biological network complexity;data mining;clustering algorithm;cluster validation","","641","","77","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This high-level control problem is commonly referred as the power management problem. In the past, many supervisory control strategies were developed on the basis of a few pre-defined driving cycles, using intuition and heuristics. The resulting control strategy was often inherently cycle-beating and lacked a guaranteed level of optimality. In this study, the power management problem is tackled from a stochastic viewpoint. An infinite-horizon stochastic dynamic optimization problem is formulated. The power demand from the driver is modeled as a random Markov process. The optimal control strategy is then obtained by using stochastic dynamic programming (SDP). The obtained control law is in the form of a stationary full-state feedback and can be directly implemented. Simulation results over standard driving cycles and random driving cycles are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed stochastic approach. It was found that the obtained SDP control algorithm outperforms a sub-optimal rule-based control strategy trained from deterministic DP results.","0743-1619","0-7803-8335-4","10.23919/ACC.2004.1384056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1384056","","Stochastic processes;Hybrid electric vehicles;Supervisory control;Energy management;Optimal control;Fuel economy;Vehicle dynamics;Power demand;Markov processes;Dynamic programming","stochastic programming;hybrid electric vehicles;energy management systems;Markov processes;optimal control;dynamic programming;state feedback;road vehicles","stochastic control strategy;hybrid electric vehicle;supervisory control strategy;power management problem;infinite-horizon stochastic dynamic optimization problem;random Markov process;optimal control strategy;stochastic dynamic programming;stationary full-state feedback;standard driving cycle;random driving cycle","","57","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed architecture is suitable for low-voltage operation in deep-submicrometer technologies because the image processing is implemented by 1-bit fully digital circuits with a small number of logic gates. The principles of the image processing are addressed. We have fabricated a 16 /spl times/ 16-pixel prototype vision chip. The relationship between illumination and the output pulse frequency is characterized. Step responses of the prototype vision chip for fundamental image processing operations show good agreement with those expected by correlation-based spatial filtering. A simple image binarization method specific to our architecture is also presented. The histograms of the intervals of the output pulses after image processing show multiple peaks, which indicates that averaging of the intervals is required for longer periods to achieve higher image-processing quality.

Although GPS was originally designed for military applications, GPS has also been used in many civilian applications. The reliability of GPS receivers and the availability of GPS signals have become crucial in the fast-growing use of GPS in military and civilian applications. GPS is designed as a spread spectrum system in order to provide resistance to jamming. Denial of service of GPS receivers in some European countries (intentional or unintentional jamming) has been reported. In addition, the production of GPS jammers increases doubts about GPS signal availability and GPS receiver reliability. The paper aims to investigate GPS receiver performance under different jamming waveforms. In order to determine GPS receiver performance, the GPS signal structure has been analyzed, and GPS jamming strategies and GPS receiver architectures have been investigated. A generic GPS receiver model is implemented using the MATLAB/spl bsol/SIMULINK tool. Since jamming strategies mainly disturb a GPS receiver's signal processing functions, only the signal processing functions of the GPS receiver are investigated. The effect of several GPS jamming strategies are investigated by simulation.","","0-7803-8318-4","10.1109/SIU.2004.1338639","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1338639","","Jamming;Global Positioning System;Receivers;Radio navigation;Availability;Signal processing;Earth;Spread spectrum communication;Computer crime;Production","Global Positioning System;jamming;radio receivers;reliability;spread spectrum communication;signal processing","GPS receiver jamming;radio navigation system;GPS receiver reliability;GPS signal availability;spread spectrum system;jamming resistance;denial of service;jamming waveforms;signal processing functions","","12","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This structure is in essence a composite right/left-handed (CRLH) microstrip structure incorporating varactor diodes for fixed-frequency voltage-controlled operation. Angle scanning at a fixed frequency is achieved by modulating the capacitances of the structure by adjusting the (uniform) bias voltage applied to the varactors. Beamwidth tuning is obtained by making the structure nonuniform by application of a nonuniform bias voltage distribution of the varactors. A rigorous analysis based on an extension of the CRLH concept is proposed and the corresponding dispersion curves, obtained by equivalent-circuit formulas with LC parameters extracted from full-wave simulation, are shown. A 30-cell LW antenna structure, incorporating both series and shunt varactors for optimal impedance matching and maximal tuning range, is designed. This prototype exhibits continuous scanning capability from 50/spl deg/ to -49/spl deg/ by tuning the bias voltages from 0 to 21 V at 3.33 GHz. A maximum gain of 18 dBi at broadside is also achieved. In addition, it provides half-power beamwidth variation of up to 200% with comparison to the case of uniform biasing. The effect of intermodulation due to the nonlinearity of the varactors is shown to be negligible for antenna applications. The antenna is tested in a 10-Mb/s binary phase-shift key transmission link and successful recovery of the baseband data is demonstrated.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2004.838302","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1366539","Beamwidth tuning;composite right/left-handed (CRLH) transmission line (TL);electronic scanning;leaky-wave (LW) antenna;left-handed metamaterials (LHMs);nonuniform TL;varactor diode","Transmission lines;Leaky wave antennas;Varactors;Voltage;Transmitting antennas;Microstrip;Diodes;Frequency;Capacitance;Tuning","metamaterials;leaky wave antennas;microstrip antennas;varactors;tuning;impedance matching;phase shift keying;intermodulation distortion;antenna testing;scanning antennas","metamaterial based electronic control;transmission line structure;leaky wave antenna;tunable radiation angle;beamwidth tuning;composite right/left handed microstrip structure;varactor diodes;fixed frequency voltage controlled operation;nonuniform bias voltage distribution;dispersion curves;LC parameters;optimal impedance matching;series varactors;shunt varactors;intermodulation effect;binary phase shift key transmission link;0 to 21 V;3.33 GHz;10 Mbit/s","","192","","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These materials, which are arranged in periodic configurations, are applied for the design of novel EM structures with applications in the VHF-UHF bands. The utility of these materials is demonstrated by considering two challenging problems, namely, design of miniaturized electromagnetic band-gap (EBG) structures and antennas in the VHF-UHF bands. A woodpile EBG made up of magneto-dielectric material is proposed. It is shown that the magneto-dielectric woodpile not only exhibits band-gap rejection values much higher than the ordinary dielectric woodpile, but also for the same physical dimensions it shows a rejection band at a much lower frequency. The higher rejection is a result of higher effective impedance contrasts between consecutive layers of the magneto-dielectric woodpile structure. Composite magneto-dielectrics are also shown to provide certain advantages when used as substrates for planar antennas. These substrates are used to miniaturize antennas while maintaining a relatively high bandwidth and efficiency. An artificial anisotropic meta-substrate having /spl mu//sub r/>/spl epsiv//sub r/, made up of layered magneto-dielectric and dielectric materials is designed to maximize the bandwidth of a miniaturized patch antenna. Analytical and numerical approaches, based on the anisotropic effective medium theory (AEMT) and the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique, are applied to carry out the analyzes and fully characterize the performance of finite and infinite periodic magneto-dielectric meta-materials integrated into the EBG and antenna designs.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2004.829413","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1303873","","Electromagnetics;Magnetic anisotropy;Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy;Periodic structures;Magnetic materials;Dielectric materials;Metamaterials;Dielectric substrates;Bandwidth;Anisotropic magnetoresistance","photonic band gap;dielectric materials;magnetic materials;finite difference time-domain analysis;planar antenna arrays;mobile antennas;UHF antennas;VHF antennas;substrates;microstrip antennas","periodic magneto-dielectric meta-materials;VHF band;UHF bands;electromagnetic band-gap structure;woodpile EBG;planar antennas;artificial anisotropic meta-substrate;anisotropic effective medium theory;AEMT;finite-difference time-domain;FDTD","","345","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we consider online learning in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. By considering classical stochastic gradient descent within a feature space and the use of some straightforward tricks, we develop simple and computationally efficient algorithms for a wide range of problems such as classification, regression, and novelty detection. In addition to allowing the exploitation of the kernel trick in an online setting, we examine the value of large margins for classification in the online setting with a drifting target.

For the resulting channel, a uniform input maximizes mutual information, which in the limit of large lattice dimension becomes 1/2 log (1+SNR), i.e., the full capacity of the original power constrained AWGN channel. We then show that capacity may also be achieved using nested lattice codes, the coarse lattice serving for shaping via the modulo-lattice transformation, the fine lattice for channel coding. We show that such pairs exist for any desired nesting ratio, i.e., for any signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, for the modulo-lattice additive noise channel lattice decoding is optimal.

A constraint on their application in remote sensing has been their binary nature, requiring multiclass classifications to be based upon a large number of binary analyses. Here, an approach for multiclass classification of airborne sensor data by a single SVM analysis is evaluated against a series of classifiers that are widely used in remote sensing, with particular regard to the effect of training set size on classification accuracy. In addition to the SVM, the same datasets were classified using a discriminant analysis, decision tree, and multilayer perceptron neural network. The accuracy statements of the classifications derived from the different classifiers were compared in a statistically rigorous fashion that accommodated for the related nature of the samples used in the analyses. For each classification technique, accuracy was positively related with the size of the training set. In general, the most accurate classifications were derived from the SVM approach, and with the largest training set the SVM classification was significantly (p < 0.05)more accurate (93.75%) than that derived from the discriminant analysis (90.00%) and decision tree algorithms (90.31%). Although each classifier could yield a very accurate classification, > 90% correct, the classifiers differed in the ability to correctly label individual cases and so may be suitable candidates for an ensemble-based approach to classification.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.827257","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1304900","","Image classification;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Classification tree analysis;Remote sensing;Decision trees;Multilayer perceptrons;Neural networks;Multi-layer neural network;Algorithm design and analysis","remote sensing;geophysical techniques;geophysical signal processing;image classification;support vector machines;multilayer perceptrons;decision trees","multiclass image classification;support vector machines;SVM analysis;remote sensing;binary analysis;airborne sensor data;discriminant analysis;decision tree;multilayer perceptron neural network;training set size;SVM classification;accuracy comparison;supervised classification","","535","","45","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The project growth is similar for all the projects in the analysis, indicating that other factors may limit growth. The hypothesis that creativity is more prevalent in open-source software is also examined, and evidence to support this hypothesis is found using the metric of functions added over time. The concept of open-source projects succeeding because of their simplicity is not supported by the analysis, nor is the hypothesis of open-source projects being more modular. However, the belief that defects are found and fixed more rapidly in open-source projects is supported by an analysis of the functions modified.

The VSC based HVDC transmission system mainly consists of two converter stations connected by a dc cable. This paper presents the modelling and control design of VSC based HVDC which uses twelve pulse three level converter topology. The reactive current injected by individual VSCs can be maintained constant or controlled to regulate converter bus voltage constant. While one VSC regulates the dc bus voltage the other controls the power flow in the dc link. Each VSC can have up to 4 controllers depending on the operating mode. The controller structure adopted for power controller is of PID type and all other controllers are of PI type. Each operating mode requires proper tuning of controller gains in order to achieve satisfactory system performance. This paper discusses a systematic approach for parameter optimization in selecting controller gains of VSC based HVDC. The analysis of VSC based HVDC is carried using both D-Q model (neglecting harmonics in the output voltages of VSC) and three phase detailed model of VSC using switching functions. While the eigenvalue analysis and controller design is based on the D-Q model, the transient simulation considers both models. The analysis considers different operating modes of the converters.","","0-7803-8610-8","10.1109/ICPST.2004.1460096","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1460096","","Control design;Control system analysis;HVDC transmission;Converters;Power conversion;Power system modeling;Voltage control;Control systems;Insulated gate bipolar transistors;Topology","HVDC power transmission;power transmission control;insulated gate bipolar transistors;power convertors;voltage control;power control;three-term control;PI control;control system analysis;control system synthesis;optimisation;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","VSC based HVDC transmission system modelling;VSC based HVDC transmission system control design;power semiconductors;IGBT;voltage source converters;converter stations;dc cable;twelve pulse three level converter topology;reactive current;converter bus voltage constant regulation;dc bus voltage regulation;power flow control;PID type controller;PI type controller;parameter optimization;D-Q model;VSC three phase detailed model;switching functions;eigenvalue analysis;controller design;transient simulation","","34","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, some modules degrade or even fail when operating outdoors for extended periods. To reduce the degradation, and the number of failures, extensive research is needed on the performance of PV modules. The aim of this study was to establish a photovoltaic degradation and failure assessment procedure. This procedure should assess all parameters of PV modules to completely analyze any observed degradation or failure. In this paper some degradation modes of PV modules are discussed and a procedure used to assess these degradation modes is then presented. Results obtained by subjecting Copper Indium Diselenide (CIS), single and triple junction amorphous silicon (a-Si and a-SiGe), Edge-defined Film-fed Growth (EFG) silicon and mono-crystalline silicon (mono-Si) modules to the assessment procedure are presented and discussed. Results obtained indicate that the thin-film modules degrade by up to 50% in performance after an initial outdoor exposure of 130 kWh/m/sup 2/. Visual inspection revealed that both crystalline modules had cracked cells. The mismatch due to the cracked cell in the EFG-Si module, however, was limited by the interconnect busbars.

This paper sets out an analytical basis for their design and comparison, verified against full time-domain simulations. Most reported microgenerators are classified as either velocity-damped resonant generators (VDRGs) or Coulomb-damped resonant generators (CDRGs) and a unified analytical structure is provided for these generator types. Reported generators are shown to have operated at well below achievable power densities and design guides are given for optimising future devices. The paper also describes a new class-the Coulomb-force parametric generator (CFPG)-which does not operate in a resonant manner. For all three generators, expressions and graphs are provided showing the dependence of output power on key operating parameters. The optimization also considers physical generator constraints such as voltage limitation or maximum or minimum damping ratios. The sensitivity of each generator architecture to the source vibration frequency is analyzed and this shows that the CFPG can be better suited than the resonant generators to applications where the source frequency is likely to vary. It is demonstrated that mechanical resonance is particularly useful when the vibration source amplitude is small compared to the allowable mass-to-frame displacement. The CDRG and the VDRG generate the same power at resonance but give better performance below and above resonance respectively. Both resonant generator types are unable to operate when the allowable mass frame displacement is small compared to the vibration source amplitude, as is likely to be the case in some MEMS applications. The CFPG is, therefore, required for such applications.","1941-0158","","10.1109/JMEMS.2004.830151","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1303621","","Resonance;Vibrations;Power generation;Micromechanical devices;Frequency;Computer architecture;Ubiquitous computing;Time domain analysis;Computational modeling;Analytical models","micromechanical devices;electric generators;vibrations;distributed sensors;power supplies to apparatus","vibration-driven micropower generators;MEMS microgenerator;distributed sensing;ubiquitous computing;velocity-damped resonant generators;Coulomb-damped resonant generators;Coulomb-force parametric generator;voltage limitation;maximum damping ratios;minimum damping ratios;generator architecture;source vibration frequency;mechanical resonance;vibration source amplitude;mass-to-frame displacement;inertial-generators;microelectromechanical devices;self-powered systems;vibration-to-electric energy conversion","","494","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A high-efficiency high step-up converter is proposed, with low voltage stress on power switch, power diodes and output capacitors. The circuit topology of the proposed converter consists of an energy clamp circuit and a voltage boost cell. The boost converter functions as an active clamp circuit to suppress the voltage spike on power switch during the turn-off transient period. The boost converter output terminal and flyback converter output terminal are serially connected to increase the output voltage gain with the coupled inductor. By serially connecting the secondary windings of the boost inductor, a high voltage gain is achieved with less voltage stress on the power devices, such as power MOSFET and power diodes. The operational principle and steady-state analysis are described. A 35 W converter with simulation and experimental results is presented to demonstrate the performance. It shows that the efficiency of the proposed converter is very high (nearly 93%) with four times the voltage output.","1350-2352","","10.1049/ip-epa:20040022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1270525","","","power semiconductor diodes;network topology;DC-DC power convertors;transient response;inductors;power MOSFET","equivalent series resistor;boost inductor;voltage gain;step-up converter;power switch;power diodes;circuit topology;energy clamp circuit;voltage boost cell;boost converter;voltage spike;turn-off transient period;flyback converter;coupled inductor;voltage stress;power MOSFET;steady-state analysis","","240","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals"
"A hybrid of genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization for recurrent network design","Chia-Feng Juang","Dept. of Electr. Eng., Nat. Chung Hsing Univ., Taichung, Taiwan","IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","","2004","34","2","997","1006","An evolutionary recurrent network which automates the design of recurrent neural/fuzzy networks using a new evolutionary learning algorithm is proposed in this paper. This new evolutionary learning algorithm is based on a hybrid of genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), and is thus called HGAPSO. In HGAPSO, individuals in a new generation are created, not only by crossover and mutation operation as in GA, but also by PSO. The concept of elite strategy is adopted in HGAPSO, where the upper-half of the best-performing individuals in a population are regarded as elites. However, instead of being reproduced directly to the next generation, these elites are first enhanced. The group constituted by the elites is regarded as a swarm, and each elite corresponds to a particle within it. In this regard, the elites are enhanced by PSO, an operation which mimics the maturing phenomenon in nature. These enhanced elites constitute half of the population in the new generation, whereas the other half is generated by performing crossover and mutation operation on these enhanced elites. HGAPSO is applied to recurrent neural/fuzzy network design as follows. For recurrent neural network, a fully connected recurrent neural network is designed and applied to a temporal sequence production problem. For recurrent fuzzy network design, a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang-type recurrent fuzzy network is designed and applied to dynamic plant control. The performance of HGAPSO is compared to both GA and PSO in these recurrent networks design problems, demonstrating its superiority.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2003.818557","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1275532","","Genetic algorithms;Particle swarm optimization;Algorithm design and analysis;Evolutionary computation;Design optimization;Fuzzy control;Neural networks;Machine learning;Fuzzy neural networks;Genetic mutations","genetic algorithms;recurrent neural nets","genetic algorithm;particle swarm optimization;recurrent network design;evolutionary recurrent network;fuzzy networks;evolutionary learning algorithm;HGAPSO;crossover;mutation;temporal sequence production problem;Takagi-Sugeno-Kang-type recurrent fuzzy network;dynamic plant control","","586","","58","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, composite field arithmetic is employed to reduce the area requirements, and different implementations for the inversion in subfield GF(2/sup 4/) are compared. In addition, an efficient key expansion architecture suitable for the subpipelined round units is also presented.

Current authentication systems based on physiological and behavioral characteristics of persons (known as biometrics), such as fingerprints, inherently provide solutions to many of these problems and may replace the authentication component of traditional cryptosystems. We present various methods that monolithically bind a cryptographic key with the biometric template of a user stored in the database in such a way that the key cannot be revealed without a successful biometric authentication. We assess the performance of one of these biometric key binding/generation algorithms using the fingerprint biometric. We illustrate the challenges involved in biometric key generation primarily due to drastic acquisition variations in the representation of a biometric identifier and the imperfect nature of biometric feature extraction and matching algorithms.

It then proposes a specific fixed gain relay that benefits from the knowledge of the first hop's average fading power and compares its performance with previously proposed relay gains that in contrast require knowledge of the instantaneous channel state information of the first hop. Finally, the letter investigates the effect of the relay saturation on the performance of the systems under consideration.

Firstly, a simulation of Shell SM50-H PV module current-voltage (I-V) and power-voltage (P-V) characteristics at various insolation and temperature levels have been carried out using Matlab software. Next, the incremental conductance algorithm is applied for maximum power point (MPP) tracking purpose, which is developed using C programming. This algorithm is selected due to its ability to withstand against any parameter variation and having a very high efficiency. As a result, by variation of the temperature and the insolation, the algorithm still managed to track the MPP successfully. Finally, a model of a boost converter is constructed using Matlab/Simulink, particularly with great utilization of the power system blockset, (PSB), in order to verify the performance of proposed MPPT system. MPPT controlling process is developed using a simple voltage based MPPT that is controlled by a microcontroller-based unit to drive the MOSFET power switch. As for the consequences, this technique performance tends to give significant efficiency, in addition, it is cost saving and reliable.","","0-7803-8724-4","10.1109/PECON.2004.1461622","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1461622","","Power system modeling;Photovoltaic systems;Mathematical model;Temperature;Voltage control;Solar power generation;Batteries;Application software;Power system management;Process control","power convertors;microcontrollers;field effect transistor switches;battery chargers;solar cell arrays;power MOSFET","maximum power point tracker;photovoltaic system;battery charging application;module current-voltage;Matlab software;incremental conductance algorithm;C programming;boost converter;Matlab;Simulink;power system blockset;microcontroller-based unit;MOSFET power switch;PV array;solar cells","","45","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the results from the application of standard clustering methods to genes are limited. This limitation is imposed by the existence of a number of experimental conditions where the activity of genes is uncorrelated. A similar limitation exists when clustering of conditions is performed. For this reason, a number of algorithms that perform simultaneous clustering on the row and column dimensions of the data matrix has been proposed. The goal is to find submatrices, that is, subgroups of genes and subgroups of conditions, where the genes exhibit highly correlated activities for every condition. In this paper, we refer to this class of algorithms as biclustering. Biclustering is also referred in the literature as coclustering and direct clustering, among others names, and has also been used in fields such as information retrieval and data mining. In this comprehensive survey, we analyze a large number of existing approaches to biclustering, and classify them in accordance with the type of biclusters they can find, the patterns of biclusters that are discovered, the methods used to perform the search, the approaches used to evaluate the solution, and the target applications.","1557-9964","","10.1109/TCBB.2004.2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1324618","Biclustering;simultaneous clustering;coclustering;subspace clustering;bidimensional clustering;direct clustering;block clustering;two-way clustering;two-mode clustering;two-sided clustering;microarray data analysis;biological data analysis;gene expression data.","Data analysis;Gene expression;Clustering algorithms;Pattern analysis;Data mining;Clustering methods;Information retrieval;Performance analysis;Performance evaluation;Semiconductor device measurement","genetics;molecular biophysics;pattern clustering;biology computing","biclustering algorithms;biological data analysis;gene expression;microarray experiments;gene subgroups;coclustering;direct clustering;information retrieval;data mining","Algorithms;Cluster Analysis;Computational Biology;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profiling;Humans;Models, Statistical;Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis;Saccharomyces cerevisiae","1096","","52","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on this representation, a learning algorithm is used to automatically learn to detect instances of the object class in new images. The approach can be applied to any object with distinguishable parts in a relatively fixed spatial configuration; it is evaluated here on difficult sets of real-world images containing side views of cars, and is seen to successfully detect objects in varying conditions amidst background clutter and mild occlusion.

Numerical results reveal that retransmissions at the data link layer relieve stringent error control requirements at the physical layer, and thereby enable considerable spectral efficiency gain. This gain is comparable with that offered by diversity, provided that the maximum number of transmissions per packet equals the diversity order. Diminishing returns on spectral efficiency, that result when increasing the maximum number of retransmissions, suggest that a small number of retransmissions offers a desirable delay-throughput tradeoff, in practice.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2004.833474","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1343909","","Modulation coding;Automatic repeat request;Physical layer;Cross layer design;Delay;Quality of service;Throughput;Fading;Error correction;Wireless communication","adaptive modulation;adaptive codes;automatic repeat request;radio links;data communication;optimisation;delays;fading channels;diversity reception","adaptive modulation;adaptive coding;truncated ARQ;wireless links;automatic repeat request protocol;data link layer;maximize spectral efficiency;delay constraint;error performance constraint;Nakagami-m block fading channel;diversity order;packet equal;delay-throughput tradeoff","","661","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using delayed turn-off times, the circuit breakers can be coordinated with lower level protection gear. Hence, a high availability of the grid can be guaranteed. However, during a short-circuit a significant voltage sag can be noticed locally in the medium-voltage grid. Sensitive loads such as computers will fail even if the voltage returns within a few seconds. A semiconductor circuit breaker, however, is able to switch fast enough to keep voltage disturbance within acceptable limits. The optimization and selection of power electronic switch topologies is critical. In this paper, different semiconductors are briefly compared considering the requirements of a solid-state switch integrated into a 20-kV medium-voltage grid. Based on these semiconductor characteristics, various switch topologies are developed, which are compared under technical and economical aspects. It is shown that solid-state circuit breakers offer significant advantages when compared to present solutions and can be used in today's medium-voltage power systems.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2004.833454","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1331495","","Solid state circuits;Current limiters;Medium voltage;Power systems;Power semiconductor switches;Circuit breakers;Power system protection;Voltage fluctuations;Circuit topology;Delay","circuit breakers;current limiters;power distribution;power system interconnection;semiconductor devices","solid-state circuit breakers;current limiters;medium-voltage systems;distributed power systems;mechanical circuit breakers;voltage sag;medium voltage grid;semiconductor circuit breakers;optimization;power electronic switch topology","","231","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is further complicated by the variety of applications that these sensors are being required to fulfill. A review of the motivation for the development of these sensors is followed by a discussion of the consequent implications for waveform design and limitations on system architecture. Other practical considerations such as available semiconductor technology, packaging, and assembly techniques are reviewed, and results are presented for conventional surface-mount plastic packages illustrating their usefulness in the greater than 20-GHz frequency range. Suitable antenna technology for wide-band transmission is presented that is compliant with the specific restrictions stipulated in the FCC ruling.

This is an important step toward realizing a truly modular power system architecture, where low-power, low-voltage, building block modules can be connected in any series/parallel combination at input or at output, to realize any given system specifications. A three-loop control scheme, consisting of a common output voltage loop, individual inner current loops, and individual input voltage loops, is proposed to achieve input voltage and load current sharing. The output voltage loop provides the basic reference for inner current loops, which is modified by the respective input voltage loops. The average of converter input voltages, which is dynamically varying, is chosen as the reference for input voltage loops. This choice of reference eliminates interaction among different control loops. The input-series and output-parallel (ISOP) configuration is analyzed using the incremental negative resistance model of DC/DC converters. Based on the analysis, design methods for input voltage controller are developed.

Planning for a disaster may seem odd at first. But it is a smart choice for anyone who wants to protect a valuable asset. For instance, just as you would not carelessly store paper money next to the fireplace, the same intelligence applies to data and computers. A catastrophe is anything that threatens the function or existence of a business, ranging from a computer virus to a huge earthquake. A well thought out disaster recovery plan can play a major role in a company's survival/success. Disaster recovery covers a broad range of topics and includes practically everyone in an organization.

The dynamics of each neuron in the topologically organized neural network is characterized by a shunting equation derived from Hodgkin and Huxley's (1952) membrane equation.

The first Knowledge Discovery in Databases Workshop was held in August 1989, in conjunction with the 1989 International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, and this workshop series became the International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) in 1995. In 2003, there were a total of 15 data mining conferences, most of which are listed at http://www.kdnuggets.com/meetings/meetings-2OO3-past.html. These 15 conferences do not include various artificial intelligence (AI), statistics and database conferences (and their workshops) that also solicited and accepted data mining related papers, such as DC AI, ICML, ICTAI, COMPSTAT, AI & Statistics, SIGMOD, VLDB, ICDE, and CIKM. Among various data mining conferences, KDD and ICDM (the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining) are arguably (or unarguably) the two premier ones in the field. ICDM was established in 2000, sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society, and had its first annual meeting in 2001. This work reviews the topics of interest from ICDM from an AI perspective, and analyze common topics in data mining and AI, including key AI ideas that have been used in both data mining and machine learning. We also discuss two current research projects on (1) user-centered agents for biological information exploration on the Web, and (2) dynamic classifier selection in dealing with streaming data.

Res., Princeton, NJ, USA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","","2004","13","11","1491","1506","We present an approach that incorporates appearance-adaptive models in a particle filter to realize robust visual tracking and recognition algorithms. Tracking needs modeling interframe motion and appearance changes, whereas recognition needs modeling appearance changes between frames and gallery images. In conventional tracking algorithms, the appearance model is either fixed or rapidly changing, and the motion model is simply a random walk with fixed noise variance. Also, the number of particles is typically fixed. All these factors make the visual tracker unstable. To stabilize the tracker, we propose the following modifications: an observation model arising from an adaptive appearance model, an adaptive velocity motion model with adaptive noise variance, and an adaptive number of particles. The adaptive-velocity model is derived using a first-order linear predictor based on the appearance difference between the incoming observation and the previous particle configuration. Occlusion analysis is implemented using robust statistics. Experimental results on tracking visual objects in long outdoor and indoor video sequences demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our tracking algorithm. We then perform simultaneous tracking and recognition by embedding them in a particle filter. For recognition purposes, we model the appearance changes between frames and gallery images by constructing the intra- and extrapersonal spaces. Accurate recognition is achieved when confronted by pose and view variations.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2004.836152","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1344039","","Particle tracking;Particle filters;Laboratories;State estimation;Noise robustness;Image recognition;Filtering;Kinematics;Training data;Predictive models","image recognition;statistical analysis;tracking;hidden feature removal;adaptive filters","visual tracking;visual recognition;appearance-adaptive model;first-order linear predictor;adaptive noise variance;occlusion analysis;robust statistics","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Feedback;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Male;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Motion;Movement;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique","468","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on the functioning of the individual module, the modular approach enables the powerfully intelligent and robust control modules to easily replace any existing module which does not perform well, meanwhile retaining other existing modules which are still effective. Property analysis is first conducted for the existing function modules in a conventional PMSM control system: proportional-integral (PI) speed control module, reference current-generating module, and PI current control module. Next, it is shown that the conventional PMSM controller is not able to reject the torque pulsation which is the main hurdle when PMSM is used as a high-performance servo. By virtue of the internal model, to nullify the torque pulsation it is imperative to incorporate an internal model in the feed-through path. This is achieved by replacing the reference current-generating module with an iterative learning control (ILC) module. The ILC module records the cyclic torque and reference current signals over one entire cycle, and then uses those signals to update the reference current for the next cycle. As a consequence, the torque pulsation can be reduced significantly. In order to estimate the torque ripples which may exceed certain bandwidth of a torque transducer, a novel torque estimation module using a gain-shaped sliding-mode observer is further developed to facilitate the implementation of torque learning control. The proposed control system is evaluated through real-time implementation and experimental results validate the effectiveness.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2004.825365","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1302328","","Torque control;Velocity control;Control systems;Sliding mode control;Synchronous motors;Intelligent control;Robust control;Pi control;Proportional control;Current control","permanent magnet motors;synchronous motors;angular velocity control;robust control;PI control;electric current control;machine control;torque control;iterative methods;variable structure systems","modular control scheme;permanent-magnet synchronous motor control system;speed control;pulsating torque minimization;robust control modules;proportional-integral;current-generating module;PI current control module;PMSM controller;iterative learning control module;torque ripples;torque transducer;torque estimation module;gain-shaped sliding-mode observer;torque learning control;real-time implementation","","140","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents and verifies a novel voltage sag detection technique for use in conjunction with the main control system of a DVR. In all cases it is necessary for the DVR control system to not only detect the start and end of a voltage sag but also to determine the sag depth and any associated phase shift. The DVR, which is placed in series with a sensitive load, must be able to respond quickly to a voltage sag if end users of sensitive equipment are to experience no voltage sags. A problem arises when fast evaluation of the sag depth and phase shift is required, as this information is normally embedded within the core of a main DVR control scheme and is not readily available to either users monitoring the state of the grid or parallel controllers. Previous research presented an additional controller, which required phase and sag depth information to manipulate the injection voltage vector returned by the main controller in order to prevent the DVR injection transformers from saturating. Typical standard information tracking or detection methods such as the Fourier transform or phase-locked loop (PLL) are too slow in returning this information, when either applied to the injection voltage vector, or to the supply voltages directly. As a result of this the voltage sag detection method in this paper proposes a new matrix method, which is able to compute the phase shift and voltage reduction of the supply voltage much quicker than the Fourier transform or a PLL. The paper also illustrates that the matrix method returns results that can be directly interpreted, whereas other methods such as the wavelet transform return results that can be difficult to interpret.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2003.821801","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268198","","Voltage fluctuations;Voltage control;Phase detection;Phase locked loops;Power quality;Control systems;Fourier transforms;Protection;Monitoring;Transformers","electric potential;voltage regulators;matrix algebra;voltage control","voltage sag detection;dynamic voltage restorer;distribution feeder;sag depth;phase shift;parallel controllers;injection transformer;injection voltage sector;numerical matrix method;wavelet transform","","160","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The common mode voltage generated by a conventional three-level inverter can be eliminated by switching only the voltage space vectors which do not produce the common mode voltage. This paper presents a PWM switching strategy to eliminate common mode voltage using the open-end winding configuration for the induction motor. The switching strategy presented in this paper, does not generate any alternating common mode voltages in the drive system and hence the electrostatic coupling of the common mode voltage, which results in the bearing currents and the leakage currents, is avoided. The proposed scheme is devoid of neutral point voltage fluctuations and does not require neutral point clamping diodes, when compared to the common mode elimination scheme based on the conventional three-level inverter topology. Also, the present scheme uses a single dc-link with half the voltage compared to the conventional three-level inverter based scheme.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2004.826514","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1296756","","Voltage;Induction motor drives;Pulse width modulation inverters;Induction generators;Induction motors;Leakage current;Pulse width modulation;Pulse inverters;Pulse generation;Electromagnetic interference","induction motor drives;PWM invertors;leakage currents;electromagnetic interference","dual two-level inverter scheme;common mode voltage elimination;induction motor drive;pulse width modulation inverters;PWM inverters;leakage current;electromagnetic interference;voltage space vector;open-end winding configuration","","283","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By exploiting the special properties of the affine terms of the two classes of MIMO systems, the developed neural control schemes avoid the controller singularity problem completely without using projection algorithms. Semiglobal uniform ultimate boundedness (SGUUB) of all the signals in the closed-loop of MIMO nonlinear systems is achieved. The outputs of the systems are proven to converge to a small neighborhood of the desired trajectories. The control performance of the closed-loop system is guaranteed by suitably choosing the design parameters. The proposed schemes offer systematic design procedures for the control of the two classes of uncertain MIMO nonlinear systems. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the approach.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2004.826130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1296694","","Programmable control;Adaptive control;Nonlinear control systems;Control systems;MIMO;Nonlinear systems;Couplings;Uncertainty;Stability analysis;Projection algorithms","nonlinear control systems;MIMO systems;adaptive control;neurocontrollers;closed loop systems;control system synthesis","adaptive neural control;uncertain MIMO nonlinear systems;multiinput multioutput;block-triangular forms;interconnected subsystems;parametric uncertainties;closed-loop structure properties;neural control schemes;controller singularity problems;projection algorithm;semiglobal uniform ultimate boundedness;backstepping","Neural Networks (Computer);Nonlinear Dynamics","512","","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The mechanism and scheme of protection systems have been analyzed for their contribution to cascading outages as well as system stability after a fault occurs. All contingencies and the responses in the power system are depicted in their inherent stochastic manner. The power system vulnerability is assessed by both adequacy indices, such as Bus Isolation Probability (BIP), Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) and Expected Power Loss (EPL), and the security index Probability of Stability (POS). In addition, a new vulnerability index, Integrated System Vulnerability (ISV), is introduced to give a more comprehensive description of the system vulnerability.

National Power and Energy Conference, 2004.","","2004","","","220","223","Hydro power plants convert potential energy of water into electricity. It is a clean source of energy .The water after generating electrical power is available for irrigation and other purposes. The first use of moving water to produce electricity was a waterwheel on the Fox River in Wisconsin in 1882. Hydropower continued to play a major role in the expansion of electrical service early in this century around the world. Hydroelectric power plants generate from few kW to thousands of MW. They are classified as micro hydro power plants for the generating capacity less than 100 KW. Hydroelectric power plants are much more reliable and efficient as a renewable and clean source than the fossil fuel power plants. This resulted in upgrading of small to medium sized hydroelectric generating stations wherever there was an adequate supply of moving water and a need for electricity. As electricity demand soared in the middle of this century and the efficiency of coal and oil fueled power plants increased, small hydro plants fell out of favor. Mega projects of hydro power plants were developed. The majority of these power plants involved large dams, which flooded big areas of land to provide water storage and therefore a constant supply of electricity. In recent years, the environmental impacts of such large hydro projects are being identified as a cause for concern. It is becoming increasingly difficult for developers to build new dams because of opposition from environmentalists and people living on the land to be flooded. Therefore the need has arisen to go for the small scale hydro electric power plants in the range of mini and micro hydro power plants. There are no micro hydro power plants in Malaysia and the smallest category of hydro power plants in Malaysia is mini hydro with a capacity between 500 kW to 100 kW. This paper discusses the conceptual design and development of a micro hydro power plant .The overall estimation and calculation of a 50 kW power plant has been carried out. Software is also developed using MATLAB to calculate the total head, discharge rate, type of turbine for the micro hydro power plants, once the capacity is known.","","0-7803-8724-4","10.1109/PECON.2004.1461647","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1461647","","Power generation;Hydroelectric power generation;Potential energy;Energy conversion;Water resources;Irrigation;Rivers;Fossil fuels;Petroleum;Water storage","hydroelectric power stations;dams;design engineering;power engineering computing;water","micro hydro power plant;waterwheel;electrical service;hydroelectric power plants;hydroelectric generating stations;moving water;electricity demand;dams;Malaysia;MATLAB;500 to 100 kW;50 kW","","14","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we introduce an effective method for suppressing PCB radiation from their power bus over an ultrawide range of frequencies by using metallo-dielectric electromagnetic band-gap structures. More specifically, this study focuses on the suppression of radiation from parallel-plate bus structures in high-speed PCBs caused by switching noise, such as simultaneous switching noise, also known as Delta-I noise or ground bounce. This noise consists of unwanted voltage fluctuations on the power bus of a PCB due to resonance of the parallel-plate waveguiding system created by the power bus planes. The techniques introduced here are not limited to the suppression of switching noise and can be extended to any wave propagation between the plates of the power bus. Laboratory PCB prototypes were fabricated and tested revealing appreciable suppression of radiated noise over specific frequency bands of interest, thus, testifying to the effectiveness of this concept.","1558-187X","","10.1109/TEMC.2004.837671","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1362872","Electromagnetic band gap (EBG) material;electromagnetic compatibility (EMC);electromagnetic interference (EMI);switching noise","Electromagnetic interference;Interference suppression;Printed circuits;Electromagnetic compatibility;Microstrip antennas;Circuit noise","electromagnetic interference;interference suppression;printed circuits;photonic band gap;electromagnetic compatibility;microstrip antennas;parallel plate waveguides;circuit noise","electromagnetic interference reduction;printed circuit board;digital circuit;electromagnetic compatibility engineers;radiating microstrip patch antenna;PCB radiation suppression;metallo-dielectric electromagnetic bandgap structure;parallel-plate bus structure;switching noise;Delta-I noise;parallel-plate waveguide;voltage fluctuation","","154","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The usual strategy is to control the power or the torque acting on the wind turbine shafts. This paper presents an alternative control strategy, where the rotational speed is the controlled variable. The paper describes a model, which is being developed to simulate the interaction between a wind turbine and the power system.

The swimming speed of the robotic fish is adjusted by modulating joint's oscillating frequency, and its orientation is tuned by different joint's deflections. Since the motion control of a robotic fish involves both hydrodynamics of the fluid environment and dynamics of the robot, it is very difficult to establish a precise mathematical model employing purely analytical methods. Therefore, the fish's motion control task is decomposed into two control systems. The online speed control implements a hybrid control strategy and a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control algorithm. The orientation control system is based on a fuzzy logic controller.

One main advantage is that the digital control PFC implementation based on this control strategy can operate at a high switching frequency which is not directly dependent on the processing speed of DSP. Input voltage feed-forward compensation makes the output voltage insensitive to the input voltage variation and guarantees sinusoidal input current even if the input voltage is distorted.

Math., Brown Univ., Providence, RI, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","","2004","3","4","1250","1259","We are concerned with the allocation of the base station transmitter time in time-varying mobile communications with many users who are transmitting data. Time is divided into small scheduling intervals, and the channel rates for the various users are available at the start of the intervals. Since the rates vary randomly, in selecting the current user there is a conflict between full use (by selecting the user with the highest current rate) and fairness (which entails consideration for users with poor throughput to date). The proportional fair scheduler of the Qualcomm High Data Rate system and related algorithms are designed to deal with such conflicts. The aim here is to put such algorithms on a sure mathematical footing and analyze their behavior. The available analysis, while obtaining interesting information, does not address the actual convergence for arbitrarily many users under general conditions. Such algorithms are of the stochastic approximation type and results of stochastic approximation are used to analyze the long-term properties. It is shown that the limiting behavior of the sample paths of the throughputs converges to the solution of an intuitively reasonable ordinary differential equation, which is akin to a mean flow. We show that the ordinary differential equation (ODE) has a unique equilibrium and that it is characterized as optimizing a concave utility function, which shows that PFS is not ad-hoc, but actually corresponds to a reasonable maximization problem. These results may be used to analyze the performance of PFS. The results depend on the fact that the mean ODE has a special form that arises in problems with certain types of competitive behavior. There is a large set of such algorithms, each one corresponding to a concave utility function. This set allows a choice of tradeoffs between the current rate and throughout. Extensions to multiple antenna and frequency systems are given. Finally, the infinite backlog assumption is dropped and the data is allowed to arrive at random. This complicates the analysis, but the same results hold.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2004.830826","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1310314","","Convergence;Algorithm design and analysis;Throughput;Stochastic processes;Differential equations;Base stations;Transmitters;Mobile communication;Scheduling algorithm;Information analysis","radio transmitters;time-varying channels;mobile communication;scheduling;stochastic processes;difference equations;optimisation;antenna arrays;convergence of numerical methods;approximation theory","convergence;proportional-fair sharing algorithm;base station transmitter;time-varying mobile communications;scheduling intervals;qualcomm high data rate system;stochastic approximation;ordinary differential equation;optimization;concave utility function;multiple antenna systems;monotone systems","","281","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moisture is released during the aging of Kraft and, hence, its aging is auto-acceleratory. In contrast, Insuldur consumed moisture under the same conditions, aged more slowly, and its aging was less accelerated by added moisture. 2-Furfuraldehyde (2FAL), which is a dehydration product of pentosans and, hence, an index of moisture production, is also released from Kraft during aging, but not from Insuldur.

A model is introduced that applies to decoding problems, including the iterative decoding of parallel concatenated (turbo) codes, serially concatenated codes, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, and repeat-accumulate (RA) codes. EXIT functions are defined using the model, and several properties of such functions are proved for erasure channels. One property expresses the area under an EXIT function in terms of a conditional entropy. A useful consequence of this result is that the design of capacity-approaching codes reduces to a curve-fitting problem for all the aforementioned codes. A second property relates the EXIT function of a code to its Helleseth-Klove-Levenshtein information functions, and thereby to the support weights of its subcodes. The relation is via a refinement of information functions called split information functions, and via a refinement of support weights called split support weights. Split information functions are used to prove a third property that relates the EXIT function of a linear code to the EXIT function of its dual.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2004.836693","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1347354","","Transfer functions;Iterative decoding;Parity check codes;Mutual information;Concatenated codes;Convergence;Entropy;Curve fitting;Statistics","transfer functions;telecommunication channels;iterative decoding;concatenated codes;turbo codes;parity check codes;entropy codes;curve fitting","extrinsic information transfer functions;erasure channel properties;iterative processors;iterative decoding;parallel-serial concatenated codes;turbo codes;low-density parity-check code;LDPC codes;repeat-accumulate codes;conditional entropy;curve-fitting problem;Helleseth-Klove-Levenshtein information functions;split information functions;split support weights","","486","","60","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An experimental setup is developed to perform accelerated bearing tests where vibration information is collected from a number of bearings that are run until failure. This information is then used to train neural network models on predicting bearing operating times. Vibration data from a set of validation bearings are then applied to these network models. Resulting predictions are then used to estimate the bearing failure time. These predictions are then compared with the actual lives of the validation bearings and errors are computed to evaluate the effectiveness of each model.

This algorithm can track fast dynamic changes in the rotational speed, with high accuracy. Two back-to-back pulse-width-modulated (PWM) inverters are used to interface the induction generator with the grid. The front-end converter is also vector controlled.

Its effectiveness contributes not only to the introduction of fuzziness for belongingness of each pixel but also to exploitation of spatial contextual information. Although the contextual information can raise its insensitivity to noise to some extent, FCM/spl I.bar/S still lacks enough robustness to noise and outliers and is not suitable for revealing non-Euclidean structure of the input data due to the use of Euclidean distance (L/sub 2/ norm). In this paper, to overcome the above problems, we first propose two variants, FCM/spl I.bar/S/sub 1/ and FCM/spl I.bar/S/sub 2/, of FCM/spl I.bar/S to aim at simplifying its computation and then extend them, including FCM/spl I.bar/S, to corresponding robust kernelized versions KFCM/spl I.bar/S, KFCM/spl I.bar/S/sub 1/ and KFCM/spl I.bar/S/sub 2/ by the kernel methods. Our main motives of using the kernel methods consist in: inducing a class of robust non-Euclidean distance measures for the original data space to derive new objective functions and thus clustering the non-Euclidean structures in data; enhancing robustness of the original clustering algorithms to noise and outliers, and still retaining computational simplicity. The experiments on the artificial and real-world datasets show that our proposed algorithms, especially with spatial constraints, are more effective.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2004.831165","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1315771","","Image segmentation;Clustering algorithms;Noise robustness;Kernel;Clustering methods;Magnetic resonance imaging;Euclidean distance;Extraterrestrial measurements;Pixel;Computer science","image segmentation;image resolution;fuzzy set theory;computational complexity;pattern clustering","fuzzy c-means clustering;spatial constraints;image segmentation;spatial contextual information;nonEuclidean structure;Euclidean distance;robust kernelized versions;kernel-induced distance measures","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Brain;Cluster Analysis;Computer Simulation;Fuzzy Logic;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique","594","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These are networks that do not have an underlying infrastructure; the network topology is constantly changing. The inherently vulnerable characteristics of wireless ad hoc networks make them susceptible to attacks, and it may be too late before any counter action can take effect. Second, with so much advancement in hacking, if attackers try hard enough they will eventually succeed in infiltrating the system. This makes it important to constantly (or at least periodically) monitor what is taking place on a system and look for suspicious behavior. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) do just that: monitor audit data, look for intrusions to the system, and initiate a proper response (e.g., email the systems administrator, start an automatic retaliation). As such, there is a need to complement traditional security mechanisms with efficient intrusion detection and response.

In many sensor network applications the major traffic pattern consists of data collected from several source nodes to a sink through a unidirectional tree. We propose DMAC, an energy efficient and low latency MAC that is designed and optimized for such data gathering trees in wireless sensor networks. We first show that previously proposed MAC protocols for sensor networks that utilize activation/sleep duty cycles suffer from a data forwarding interruption problem, whereby not all nodes on a multihop path to the sink are notified of data delivery in progress, resulting in significant sleep delay. DMAC is designed to solve the interruption problem and allow continuous packet forwarding by giving the sleep schedule of a node an offset that depends upon its depth on the tree. DMAC also adjusts the duty cycles adaptively according to the traffic load in the network. We further propose a data prediction mechanism and the use of more-to-send (MTS) packets in order to alleviate problems pertaining to channel contention and collisions. Our simulation results show that by exploiting the application-specific structure of data gathering trees in sensor networks, DMAC provides significant energy savings and latency reduction while ensuring high data reliability.","","0-7695-2132-0","10.1109/IPDPS.2004.1303264","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1303264","","Energy efficiency;Intelligent networks;Wireless sensor networks;Delay;Telecommunication traffic;Media Access Protocol;Sleep;Fires;Access protocols;Throughput","access protocols;wireless sensor networks;wireless LAN;packet switching;telecommunication traffic;telecommunication channels;trees (mathematics)","data gathering;wireless sensor networks;source nodes;DMAC protocol;data forwarding;packet forwarding;network traffic;data prediction mechanism;more-to-send packets;channel contention;channel collisions","","151","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The simulator consists of a 10-hp induction motor (IM) which drives a generator and is driven by a 10-kW variable speed drive inverter and real-time control software. In this simulator, a microcontroller, a PC interfaced to LAB Windows I/O board, and an IGBT inverter-controlled induction motor are used instead of a real wind turbine to supply shaft torque. A control program based on C language is developed that obtains wind profiles and, by using turbine characteristics and rotation speed of IM, calculates the theoretical shaft torque of a real wind turbine. Comparing with this torque value, the shaft torque of the IM is regulated accordingly by controlling stator current demand and frequency demand of the inverter. In this way, the inverter driven induction motor acts like a real wind turbine to the energy conversion system. The drive is controlled using the measured shaft torque directly, instead of estimating it as conventional drives do. The experimental results of the proposed simulator show that this scheme is viable and accurate.

Since in a dynamic multiobjective optimization problem, the resulting Pareto-optimal set is expected to change with time (or, iteration of the optimization process), a suite of five test problems offering different patterns of such changes and different difficulties in tracking the dynamic Pareto-optimal front by a multiobjective optimization algorithm is presented. Moreover, a simple example of a dynamic multiobjective optimization problem arising from a dynamic control loop is presented.

Human faces are divided into several categories according to the variant appearance from different viewpoints. For each view category, weak classifiers are configured as confidence-rated look-up-table (LUT) of Haar feature. Real Adaboost algorithm is used to boost these weak classifiers and construct a nesting-structured face detector. To make it rotation invariant, we divide the whole 360-degree range into 12 sub-ranges and construct their corresponding view based detectors separately. To improve performance, a pose estimation method is introduced and results in a processing speed of four frames per second on 320/spl times/240 sized image. Experiments on faces with 360-degree in-plane rotation and /spl mnplus/90-degree out-of-plane rotation are reported, of which the frontal face detector subsystem retrieves 94.5% of the faces with 57 false alarms on the CMU+MlT frontal face test set and the multi-view face detector subsystem retrieves 89.8% of the faces with 221 false alarms on the CMU profile face test set.","","0-7695-2122-3","10.1109/AFGR.2004.1301512","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1301512","","Face detection;Detectors;Table lookup;Boosting;Iterative algorithms;Testing;Artificial intelligence;Computer science;Laboratories;Humans","face recognition;table lookup;computer vision;Haar transforms;image classification;real-time systems","multiview face detection;real Adaboost algorithm;confidence-rated look-up-table;Haar feature;rotation invariant;pose estimation method","","66","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Next we perform statistical analysis of the text regions to determine which image features are reliable indicators of text and have low entropy (i.e. feature response is similar for all text images). We obtain weak classifiers by using joint probabilities for feature responses on and off text. These weak classifiers are used as input to an AdaBoost machine learning algorithm to train a strong classifier. In practice, we trained a cascade with 4 strong classifiers containing 79 features. An adaptive binarization and extension algorithm is applied to those regions selected by the cascade classifier. Commercial OCR software is used to read the text or reject it as a non-text region.

Later, ten Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) implantation participated in gait measurements using our device. They walked one to three times on a 20-m walkway. Patients did the test twice: once STN-DBS was ON and once 180 min after turning it OFF. A group of ten age-matched normal subjects were also measured as controls. For each gait cycle, spatio-temporal parameters such as stride length (SL), stride velocity (SV), stance (ST), double support (DS), and gait cycle time (GC) were calculated. We found that PD patients had significantly different gait parameters comparing to controls. They had 52% less SV, 60% less SL, and 40% longer GC. Also they had significantly longer ST and DS (11% and 59% more, respectively) than controls. STN-DBS significantly improved gait parameters. During the stim ON period, PD patients had 31% faster SV, 26% longer SL, 6% shorter ST, and 26% shorter DS. GC, however, was not significantly different. Some of the gait parameters had high correlation with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) subscores including SL with a significant correlation (r=-0.90) with UPDRS gait subscore. We concluded that our method provides a simple yet effective way of ambulatory gait analysis in PD patients with results confirming those obtained from much more complex and expensive methods used in gait labs.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2004.827933","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1315867","","Legged locomotion;Parkinson's disease;Patient monitoring;Gyroscopes;Parameter estimation;Brain stimulation;Nuclear measurements;Particle measurements;Testing;Turning","gait analysis;diseases;gyroscopes;spatiotemporal phenomena;biomedical equipment;medical signal processing","gait assessment;Parkinson disease;ambulatory system;long-term monitoring;body-attached gyroscopes;spatio-temporal parameters;normal gait;pathologic gait;subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation implantation;stride length;stride velocity;stance;double support;gait cycle time;unified Parkinson disease rating scale;biomedical signal processing","Acceleration;Aged;Algorithms;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electric Stimulation Therapy;Equipment Design;Female;Gait;Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Parkinson Disease;Parkinson Disease;Parkinson Disease;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Transducers","334","","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While there exist many algorithms for clustering, the important issue of feature selection, that is, what attributes of the data should be used by the clustering algorithms, is rarely touched upon. Feature selection for clustering is difficult because, unlike in supervised learning, there are no class labels for the data and, thus, no obvious criteria to guide the search. Another important problem in clustering is the determination of the number of clusters, which clearly impacts and is influenced by the feature selection issue. In this paper, we propose the concept of feature saliency and introduce an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate it, in the context of mixture-based clustering. Due to the introduction of a minimum message length model selection criterion, the saliency of irrelevant features is driven toward zero, which corresponds to performing feature selection. The criterion and algorithm are then extended to simultaneously estimate the feature saliencies and the number of clusters.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2004.71","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1316850","Index Terms- Feature selection;clustering;unsupervised learning;mixture models;minimum message length;EM algorithm.","Clustering algorithms;Unsupervised learning;Supervised learning;Partitioning algorithms;Image segmentation;Degradation;Data analysis;Computer vision;Information retrieval","pattern clustering;unsupervised learning;Gaussian processes;optimisation;maximum likelihood estimation","feature selection;feature clustering;mixture models;unsupervised learning;clustering algorithms;expectation maximization algorithm;mixture-based clustering;minimum message length model;maximum likelihood estimation;Gaussian processes","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","364","","63","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Toward preprototype user acceptance testing of new information systems: implications for software project management","F. D. Davis; V. Venkatesh","Sam M. Walton Coll. of Bus., Univ. of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management","","2004","51","1","31","46","Errors in requirements specifications have been identified as a major contributor to costly software project failures. It would be highly beneficial if information systems developers could verify requirements by predicting workplace acceptance of a new system based on user evaluations of its specifications measured during the earliest stages of the development project, ideally before building a working prototype. However, conventional wisdom among system developers asserts that prospective users must have direct hands-on experience with at least a working prototype of a new system before they can provide assessments that accurately reflect future usage behavior after workplace implementation. The present research demonstrates that this assumption is only partially true. Specifically, it is true that stable and predictive assessments of a system's perceived ease of use should be based on direct behavioral experience using the system. However, stable and behaviorally predictive measures of perceived usefulness can be captured from target users who have received information about a system's functionality, but have not had direct hands-on usage experience. This distinction is key because, compared to ease of use, usefulness is generally much more strongly linked to future usage intentions and behaviors in the workplace. Two longitudinal field experiments show that preprototype usefulness measures can closely approximate hands-on based usefulness measures, and are significantly predictive of usage intentions and behavior up to six months after workplace implementation. The present findings open the door toward research on how user acceptance testing may be done much earlier in the system development process than has traditionally been the case. Such preprototype user acceptance tests have greater informational value than their postprototype counterparts because they are captured when only a relatively small proportion of project costs have been incurred and there is greater flexibility to modify a new system's design attributes. Implications are discussed for future research to confirm the robustness of the present findings and to better understand the practical potential and limitations of preprototype user acceptance testing.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2003.822468","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1266852","","Software management;Project management;Information systems;Information technology;Software prototyping;Technology forecasting","software management;project management;information systems;information technology;software prototyping;technological forecasting","user acceptance testing;software project management;information systems developers;working prototype;predictive assessments;longitudinal field experiments;preprototype user;IT project failure;new technology implementation;technology acceptance model","","189","","76","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, finding the content of the Web and retrieving the users' interests and needs from their behavior have become increasingly important. Web mining is used to categorize users and pages by analyzing user behavior, the content of the pages, and the order of the URLs that tend to be accessed. Web structure mining plays an important role in this approach. Two page ranking algorithms, HITS and PageRank, are commonly used in Web structure mining. Both algorithms treat all links equally when distributing rank scores. Several algorithms have been developed to improve the performance of these methods. The weighted PageRank algorithm (WPR), an extension to the standard PageRank algorithm, is introduced. WPR takes into account the importance of both the inlinks and the outlinks of the pages and distributes rank scores based on the popularity of the pages. The results of our simulation studies show that WPR performs better than the conventional PageRank algorithm in terms of returning a larger number of relevant pages to a given query.","","0-7695-2096-0","10.1109/DNSR.2004.1344743","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1344743","","Web mining;Web pages;Computer science;Niobium;Content based retrieval;Uniform resource locators;Electronic learning;Pattern analysis;Topology;Communication networks","Internet;Web sites;human factors;data mining","weighted PageRank algorithm;Website owners;Web mining;user behavior;Web page content;Web structure mining;Web page ranking;Web content mining;Web usage mining","","153","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a novel reactive control architecture for autonomous mobile robots that is based on type-2 FLC to implement the basic navigation behaviors and the coordination between these behaviors to produce a type-2 hierarchical FLC. In our experiments, we implemented this type-2 architecture in different types of mobile robots navigating in indoor and outdoor unstructured and challenging environments.

Project scope: The primary purpose of this document is to identify and describe that subset of the PMBOK that is generally accepted and adopt this as IEEE Std 1490-2002. Generally accepted means that the knowledge and practices described are applicable to most projects most of the time, and that there is widespread consensus about their value and usefulness. Generally accepted does not mean that the knowledge and practices described are or should be applied uniformly on all projects; the project management team is always responsible for determining what is appropriate for any given project. This document is also intended to provide a common lexicon within the profession for talking about project management. Project management is a relatively young profession, and while there is substantial commonality around what is done, there is relatively little commonality in the terms used. Footnote: Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) and Project Management Institute (PMI) are registered as trademarks of the Project Management Institute, Inc. Project purpose: SESC has previously adopted the 1996 version of PMIBOK to provide a framework for software engineering project management. PMBOK 2000 added new material to reflect the growth of the knowledge and practices in the field of project management by capturing those practices, tools, techniques, and other relevant items that have become generally accepted. Additionally, clarification text and figures, and corrections, have been added that make the document more valuable to users.

These torque pulsations vary periodically with rotor position and are reflected as speed ripple, which degrades the PMSM drive performance, particularly at low speeds. Because of the periodic nature of torque ripple, iterative learning control (ILC) is intuitively an excellent choice for torque ripple minimization. In this paper, first we propose an ILC scheme implemented in time domain to reduce periodic torque pulsations. A forgetting factor is introduced in this scheme to increase the robustness of the algorithm against disturbance. However, this limits the extent to which torque pulsations can be suppressed. In order to eliminate this limitation, a modified ILC scheme implemented in frequency domain by means of Fourier series expansion is presented. Experimental evaluations of both proposed schemes are carried out on a DSP-controlled PMSM drive platform. Test results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes in reducing torque ripple by a factor of approximately three under various operating conditions.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2003.820537","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1271309","","Synchronous motors;Torque control;Magnetic variables control;Air gaps;Permanent magnet motors;Current measurement;Magnetic flux;Stators;Rotors;Degradation","permanent magnet motors;minimisation;magnetic flux;Fourier series;digital signal processing chips;adaptive control;torque control;machine control;synchronous motor drives;frequency-domain analysis","torque ripple minimization;permanent magnet synchronous motors;iterative learning control;parasitic torque pulsations;nonsinusoidal flux density distribution;variable magnetic reluctance;Fourier series expansion;DSP controlled PMSM drive platform;frequency domain design","","191","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Inter-symbol interference (ISI), imperfect timing synchronization, and clock jitter are all culprits. A DAC output controlled by an oscillating waveform is proposed to mitigate the effects of switching distortion and clock jitter. This architecture has the additional benefit of mixing the DAC impulse response energy to a higher frequency, allowing a high-frequency image of the input to be used as the output. This has the potential for better noise performance and power and hardware savings relative to a conventional DAC+mixer architecture. A narrow-band sigma-delta (/spl Sigma//spl Delta/) DAC with eight unit elements is chosen to demonstrate the radio frequency digital-to-analog converter (RF DAC) concept in a 1.8-V 0.18-/spl mu/m CMOS technology. Measured single-tone SFDR is -75 dBc, SNR is 53 dB, and two-tone IMD3 is -70.8 dBc for a 17.5-MHz band centered at 942 MHz.

Eng. & Mech., Univ. of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","","2004","53","5","1573","1585","In this paper, model predictive control (MPC) is used to compute the spacing-control laws for transitional maneuvers (TMs) of vehicles equipped with adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems. A TM is required, for example, to establish a steady-state following distance behind a newly encountered vehicle traveling with a slower velocity. These spacing-control laws are computed by formulating the objective of a TM as an optimal control problem (OCP). The steady-state following distance, collision avoidance, and acceleration limits of the ACC vehicle are incorporated into the OCP as constraints. The spacing-control laws are then obtained by solving this constrained OCP by using a receding-horizon approach, where the acceleration command computed at each sampling instant is a function of the current measurements of range and range rate. A baseline scenario requiring a TM is used to evaluate and compare the performance of the MPC algorithm and the standard constant time gap (CTG) algorithm. The simulation results show that the ACC vehicle is able to perform the TM of the baseline scenario using the MPC spacing-control laws, whereas the ACC vehicle is unable to perform this TM using the CTG spacing-control laws. The success of the MPC spacing-control laws is shown to depend on whether collision avoidance and the acceleration limits of the ACC vehicle are explicitly incorporated into the formulation of the control algorithm.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2004.833625","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337334","","Predictive models;Predictive control;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Vehicles;Acceleration;Steady-state;Collision avoidance;Control system synthesis;Optimal control","predictive control;adaptive control;optimal control;collision avoidance;velocity control;road vehicles","model predictive control;transitional maneuvers;adaptive cruise control vehicles;spacing-control laws;optimal control problem;receding-horizon approach;constant time gap algorithm;collision avoidance;longitudinal vehicle control;speed control;headway control","","92","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The presented scheme is widely applicable and easy to deploy because it is based on the standard scan/ATPG methodology and adopts a very simple flow. It is nonintrusive as it does not require any modifications to the core logic such as the insertion of test points or logic bounding unknown states. The EDT scheme consists of logic embedded on a chip and a new deterministic test-pattern generation technique. The main contributions of the paper are test-stimuli compression schemes that allow us to deliver test data to the on-chip continuous-flow decompressor. In particular, it can be done by repeating certain patterns at the rates, which are adjusted to the requirements of the test cubes. Experimental results show that for industrial circuits with test cubes with very low fill rates, ranging from 3% to 0.2%, these schemes result in compression ratios of 30 to 500 times.

We present a security analysis of the source code to one such machine used in a significant share of the market. Our analysis shows that this voting system is far below even the most minimal security standards applicable in other contexts. We identify several problems including unauthorized privilege escalation, incorrect use of cryptography, vulnerabilities to network threats, and poor software development processes. We show that voters, without any insider privileges, can cast unlimited votes without being detected by any mechanisms within the voting terminal software. Furthermore, we show that even the most serious of our outsider attacks could have been discovered and executed without access to the source code. In the face of such attacks, the usual worries about insider threats are not the only concerns; outsiders can do the damage. That said, we demonstrate that the insider threat is also quite considerable, showing that not only can an insider, such as a poll worker, modify the votes, but that insiders can also violate voter privacy and match votes with the voters who cast them. We conclude that this voting system is unsuitable for use in a general election. Any paperless electronic voting system might suffer similar flaws, despite any certification it could have otherwise received. We suggest that the best solutions are voting systems having a voter-verifiable audit trail, where a computerized voting system might print a paper ballot that can be read and verified by the voter.","1081-6011","0-7695-2136-3","10.1109/SECPRI.2004.1301313","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1301313","","Electronic voting systems;Nominations and elections;Electronic voting;Computer science;Information security;Cryptography;Programming;Face detection;Privacy;Robustness","government data processing;security of data;cryptography","electronic voting system;punch-card;mechanical voting systems;security analysis;source code;security standards;cryptography;network threats;software development;general election;voter-verifiable audit trail;paper ballot","","133","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Yet, the paper proposes a new calibration technique using 1D objects (points aligned on a line), thus filling the missing dimension in calibration. In particular, we show that camera calibration is not possible with free-moving 1D objects, but can be solved if one point is fixed. A closed-form solution is developed if six or more observations of such a 1D object are made. For higher accuracy, a nonlinear technique based on the maximum likelihood criterion is then used to refine the estimate. Singularities have also been studied.

One of the possible alternatives is to realize a transient simulation scheme for PV generation systems under real weather conditions of insolation and surface temperature of solar cell. The authors propose a novel real-time simulation method for PV generation systems under real weather conditions using a real-time digital simulator (RTDS). V--I curves of a real PV panel are tested using electric load device, and a hypothetical network of the tested PV panel is created on the RTDS by arranging electrical components from the customized component model libraries. The real weather conditions, insolation, and temperature of the PV panel, are interfaced through the analog input ports of the RTDS for real-time simulation.

Compared to conventional solutions based on stationary-frame current control, this approach allows full compensation of selected frequencies, even if the active filter has limited bandwidth. Compared to synchronous-frame harmonic regulations on line currents, the complexity of the proposed algorithm is independent of the number of compensated harmonics.

"Robustness of the Markov-chain model for cyber-attack detection","Nong Ye; Yebin Zhang; C. M. Borror","Inf. & Syst. Assurance Lab., Tempe, AZ, USA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Reliability","","2004","53","1","116","123","Cyber-attack detection is used to identify cyber-attacks while they are acting on a computer and network system to compromise the security (e.g., availability, integrity, and confidentiality) of the system. This paper presents a cyber-attack detection technique through anomaly-detection, and discusses the robustness of the modeling technique employed. In this technique, a Markov-chain model represents a profile of computer-event transitions in a normal/usual operating condition of a computer and network system (a norm profile). The Markov-chain model of the norm profile is generated from historic data of the system's normal activities. The observed activities of the system are analyzed to infer the probability that the Markov-chain model of the norm profile supports the observed activities. The lower probability the observed activities receive from the Markov-chain model of the norm profile, the more likely the observed activities are anomalies resulting from cyber-attacks, and vice versa. This paper presents the learning and inference algorithms of this anomaly-detection technique based on the Markov-chain model of a norm profile, and examines its performance using the audit data of UNIX-based host machines with the Solaris operating system. The robustness of the Markov-chain model for cyber-attack detection is presented through discussions & applications. To apply the Markov-chain technique and other stochastic process techniques to model the sequential ordering of events, the quality of activity-data plays an important role in the performance of intrusion detection. The Markov-chain technique is not robust to noise in the data (the mixture level of normal activities and intrusive activities). The Markov-chain technique produces desirable performance only at a low noise level. This study also shows that the performance of the Markov-chain techniques is not always robust to the window size: as the window size increases, the amount of noise in the window also generally increases. Overall, this study provides some support for the idea that the Markov-chain technique might not be as robust as the other intrusion-detection methods such as the chi-square distance test technique , although it can produce better performance than the chi-square distance test technique when the noise level of the data is low, such as the Mill & Pascal data in this study.","1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2004.823851","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1282169","","Computer networks;Noise robustness;Noise level;Testing;Computer security;Machine learning;Inference algorithms;Operating systems;Stochastic processes;Intrusion detection","Markov processes;telecommunication security;computer networks;performance evaluation;learning (artificial intelligence);inference mechanisms","Markov-chain model;cyber-attack detection;computer-event transitions;learning algorithms;inference algorithms;anomaly-detection technique;computer audit data;Solaris operating system;stochastic process;intrusion detection;chi-square distance test technique;noise level;computer security;activity-data quality;window size","","101","","56","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

During the competition we proposed a support vector machine (SVM) model, which was the winning entry, to solve the problem. In this paper, we discuss in detail how SVM, a new learning technique, is successfully applied to load forecasting. In addition, motivated by the competition results and the approaches by other participants, more experiments and deeper analyses are conducted and presented here.

A prominent feature of roads in urban, semi-urban, and similar environments, such as in theme parks, campus sites, industrial estates, science parks, and the like, is curbs on either side defining the road's boundary. Although vision is the most common and popular sensing modality used by researchers and automotive manufacturers for road-lane detection, it can pose formidable challenges in detecting road curbs under poor illumination, bad weather, and complex driving environments. This paper proposes a novel method based on extended Kalman filtering for fast detection and tracking of road curbs using successive range/bearing readings obtained from a scanning two-dimensional ladar measurement system. As compared with millimeter wave radar methods reported in the literature, the proposed technique is simpler and computationally more efficient. This is the first of its kind reported in the literature. Qualitative experimental results are presented from the application of the technique to a campus site environment to demonstrate the viability, effectiveness, and robustness.","2374-958X","","10.1109/TRA.2004.825269","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1303691","","Laser radar;Radar tracking;Radar detection;Millimeter wave radar;Vehicle detection;Remotely operated vehicles;Road vehicles;Vehicle driving;Mobile robots;Navigation","roads;road vehicles;driver information systems;Kalman filters;nonlinear filters;optical radar;traffic engineering computing;laser ranging;computerised navigation","road boundary detection;advanced driver assistance system;autonomous vehicle navigation system;extended Kalman filter;road lane tracking;ladar measurement system;range readings","","152","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Process and measurement models are developed, based on these relations, in order to implement them into an extended Kalman filter. The performance of each filter is evaluated in terms of the roll, pitch, and yaw angles. These are derived from the filter output since this orientation representation is more intuitive than the quaternion representation.

The scheme proposed here draws close analogy to the channel equalization problem commonly encountered in digital communications. We show that, with the help of a slow but accurate ADC, the proposed code-domain adaptive finite-impulse-response filter is sufficient to remove the effect of component errors including capacitor mismatch, finite op-amp gain, op-amp offset, and sampling-switch-induced offset, provided they are not signal-dependent. The algorithm is all digital, fully adaptive, data-driven, and operates in the background. Strong tradeoffs between accuracy and speed of pipelined ADCs are greatly relaxed in this approach with the aid of digital correction techniques.

The fundamental difference between statistical MIMO and other radar array systems is that the latter seek to maximize the coherent processing gain, while statistical MIMO radar capitalizes on the diversity of target scattering to improve radar performance. Coherent processing is made possible by highly correlated signals at the receiver array, whereas in statistical MIMO radar, the signals received by the array elements are uncorrelated. It is well known that in conventional radar, slow fluctuations of the target radar cross-section (RCS) result in target fades that degrade radar performance. By spacing the antenna elements at the transmitter and at the receiver such that the target angular spread is manifested, the MIMO radar can exploit the spatial diversity of target scatterers opening the way to a variety of new techniques that can improve radar performance. In this paper, we focus on the application of the target spatial diversity to improve detection performance. The optimal detector in the Neyman-Pearson sense is developed and analyzed for the statistical MIMO radar. An optimal detector invariant to the signal and noise levels is also developed and analyzed. In this case as well, statistical MIMO radar provides great improvements over other types of array radars.","","0-7803-8622-1","10.1109/ACSSC.2004.1399142","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1399142","","MIMO;Radar cross section;Radar scattering;Radar antennas;Radar detection;Signal processing;Detectors;Performance gain;Radar signal processing;Fluctuations","MIMO systems;radar cross-sections;radar antennas;antenna arrays;statistical analysis","multiple-input multiple-output;statistical MIMO radar;radar cross section;RCS;antenna element;target spatial diversity;Neyman-Pearson method;angular diversity","","140","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the first module, an edge image of the scene is analyzed to obtain the candidates for the left and right road borders and to delimit the area that will subsequently be used to compute the mean and variance of the Gaussian distribution, assumed to be obeyed by the color components of road surfaces. The second module effectively extracts the road area and reinforces boundaries that most appropriately fit the road-extraction result. The combination of these modules can overcome basic problems due to inaccuracies in edge detection based on the intensity image alone and due to the computational complexity of segmentation algorithms based on color images.

The industry has pretty much concluded that various versions of SnAgCu solder alloy offer the best alternative for eutectic Sn/Pb solder currently in use. With the current trend of cheaper, faster, and better electronic equipment, it has become increasingly important to evaluate the package and system performance very early in the design cycle using simulation tools. This requires life prediction models for new solder alloy systems so that the package-to-board interconnect reliability can be predicted for various environmental and field conditions. This paper describes in detail the life prediction models for SnAgCu solder joints. The models are based on published constitutive equations for this alloy and thermal cycle fatigue data on actual components. The approach uses advanced finite element modeling and analysis techniques and is based on mechanics of deformation. Both accumulated creep strain and creep strain energy density based models are developed. The model has been correlated with a number of data points and predicts life within 25% in most cases.

A 20-kW converter was designed with coupled inductors to allow core-loss reduction and designed with high frequency switching to minimize the component size and eliminate the switching losses under discontinuous conducting mode operation. A dual-loop average current mode current control method implemented in DSP is employed to achieve the fast transient response. It was found through circuit analysis, simulation and experiment that the boost inductor interacted with the device parasitic capacitor and created unnecessary oscillating current whenever it reached zero current. Two high-power devices were used in both simulation and experiment to verify the analysis and design for a wide load range. Simulation and experiment results of the 20-kW boost converter under startup condition and load transient condition are also presented.

For this reason the system has been presented into two cascade partial parts, the first one relates the rotational motion whose the control law is applied in a closed loop form and the other one reflects the translational motion. A dynamic feedback controller is developed to transform the closed loop part of the system into linear, controllable and decoupled subsystem.

Such switches require less voltage headroom and avoid gate-oxide reliability problems. Mixing is achieved by exploiting two transconductors with cross-coupled outputs, which are alternatingly activated by the switches. For ideal switching, the operation is equivalent to a conventional active mixer. This paper analyzes the performance of the switched transconductor mixer, in comparison with the conventional mixer, demonstrating competitive performance at a lower supply voltage. Moreover, the new mixer has a fundamental noise benefit, as noise produced by the switch-transistors and LO-port is common mode noise, which is rejected at the differential output. An experimental prototype with 12-dB conversion gain was designed and realized in standard 0.18-/spl mu/m CMOS to operate at only a 1-V supply.

One of the enabling technologies in sensor networks is the distributed source coding (DSC), which refers to the compression of the multiple correlated sensor outputs that does not communicate with each other. DSC allows a many-to-one video coding paradigm that effectively swaps encoder-decoder complexity with respect to conventional video coding, thereby representing a fundamental concept shift in video processing.

In both cases, it is assumed that the system or environment produces a ""sleep"" signal that can be used to indicate that the circuit is in a standby mode. In the first method, the ""sleep"" signal is used to shift in a new set of external inputs and pre-selected internal signals into the circuit with the goal of setting the logic values of all of the internal signals so as to minimize the total leakage current in the circuit. This minimization is possible because the leakage current of a CMOS gate is strongly dependent on the input combination applied to its inputs. In the second method, nMOS and pMOS transistors are added to some of the gates in the circuit to increase the controllability of the internal signals of the circuit and decrease the leakage current of the gates using the ""stack effect"". This is, however, done carefully so that the minimum leakage is achieved subject to a delay constraint for all input-output paths in the circuit. In both cases, Boolean satisfiability is used to formulate the problems, which are subsequently solved by employing a highly efficient SAT solver. Experimental results on the combinational circuits in the MCNC91 benchmark suite demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the leakage current in combinational circuits by an average of 25% with only a 5% delay penalty. The second part of this paper presents a design technique for applying the minimum leakage input to a sequential circuit. The proposed method uses the built-in scan-chains in a VLSI circuit to drive it with the minimum leakage vector when it enters the sleep mode. The use of these scan registers eliminates the area and delay overhead of the additional circuitry that would otherwise be needed to apply the minimum leakage vector to the circuit. Experimental results on the sequential circuits in the MCNC91 benchmark suit show that, by using the proposed method, it is possible to reduce the leakage by an average of 25% with practically no delay penalty.","1557-9999","","10.1109/TVLSI.2003.821546","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1266404","","Leakage current;Very large scale integration;Delay;Combinational circuits;Sequential circuits;Runtime;CMOS logic circuits;Logic circuits;Minimization;MOS devices","VLSI;CMOS logic circuits;combinational circuits;sequential circuits;flip-flops;leakage currents;low-power electronics;benchmark testing","CMOS VLSI circuits;input vector control;leakage current reduction;runtime mechanisms;internal signals controllability;stack effect;combinational circuits;sequential circuit;scan registers;MCNC91 benchmark;low power design;flip-flops;minimum leakage vector","","163","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we investigate data mining as a technique for masking data, therefore, termed data mining based privacy protection. This approach incorporates partially the requirement of a targeted data mining task into the process of masking data so that essential structure is preserved in the masked data. The idea is simple but novel: we explore the data generalization concept from data mining as a way to hide detailed information, rather than discover trends and patterns. Once the data is masked, standard data mining techniques can be applied without modification. Our work demonstrated another positive use of data mining technology: not only can it discover useful patterns, but also mask private information. We consider the following privacy problem: a data holder wants to release a version of data for building classification models, but wants to protect against linking the released data to an external source for inferring sensitive information. We adapt an iterative bottom-up generalization from data mining to generalize the data. The generalized data remains useful to classification but becomes difficult to link to other sources. The generalization space is specified by a hierarchical structure of generalizations. A key is identifying the best generalization to climb up the hierarchy at each iteration. Enumerating all candidate generalizations is impractical. We present a scalable solution that examines at most one generalization in each iteration for each attribute involved in the linking.","","0-7695-2142-8","10.1109/ICDM.2004.10110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1410291","","Data mining;Data privacy;Protection;Joining processes;Couplings;Iris;Biomedical engineering;Councils;Chemical engineering","data mining;data privacy;generalisation (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering","bottom-up generalization;data mining;privacy protection;randomized data;data masking;data generalization;data holder;classification model","","107","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Proceedings of the","","2004","","","8 pp.","","Our national security, economic prosperity, and national well-being are dependent upon a set of highly interdependent critical infrastructures. Examples of these infrastructures include the national electrical grid, oil and natural gas systems, telecommunication and information networks, transportation networks, water systems, and banking and financial systems. Given the importance of their reliable and secure operations, understanding the behavior of these infrastructures - particularly when stressed or under attack - is crucial. Models and simulations can provide considerable insight into the complex nature of their behaviors and operational characteristics. These models and simulations must include interdependencies among infrastructures if they are to provide accurate representations of infrastructure characteristics and operations. A number of modeling and simulation approaches under development today directly address interdependencies and offer considerable insight into the operational and behavioral characteristics of critical infrastructures.","","0-7695-2056-1","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265180","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265180","","National security;Transportation;Power generation economics;Information security;Power system security;Petroleum;Natural gas;Banking;Fuel economy;Public healthcare","public utilities;simulation;security;socio-economic effects","critical infrastructures modeling;critical infrastructures simulation;national electrical grid;oil systems;natural gas systems;telecommunication networks;information networks;transportation networks;water systems;banking systems;financial systems;operations reliability;secure operations;infrastructures interdependencies","","181","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paper first provides a general discussion of the approximations associated with using a dc model, with an emphasis on the impact these approximations will have on security constrained OPF (SCOPF) results and LMP values. Then, since the impact of the approximations can be quite system specific, the paper provides case studies using both a small 37 bus system and a somewhat larger 12,965 bus model of the Midwest U.S. transmission grid. Results are provided comparing both the accuracy and the computational requirements of the two models. The general conclusion is that while there is some loss of accuracy using the dc approximation, the results actually match fairly closely with the full ac solution.","","0-7695-2056-1","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265164","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265164","","Load flow;Power system modeling;Nonlinear equations;Power engineering and energy;Power system interconnection;Low voltage;Sun;Power system security;Systems engineering and theory;Power engineering computing","power system economics;transmission network calculations;power system simulation;DC power transmission","AC power flow model;DC power flow model;LMP-based market calculation;security constrained OPF","","170","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we study the control of random networks and scale-free networks. Conditions are investigated for globally or locally stabilizing such networks. Our strategy is to apply local feedback control to a small fraction of network nodes. We propose the concept of virtual control for microscopic dynamics throughout the process with different pinning schemes for both random networks and scale-free networks. We explain the main reason why significantly less local controllers are required by specifically pinning the most highly connected nodes in a scale-free network than those required by the randomly pinning scheme, and why there is no significant difference between specifically and randomly pinning schemes for controlling random dynamical networks. We also study the synchronization phenomenon of controlled dynamical networks in the stabilization process, both analytically and numerically.","1558-0806","","10.1109/TCSI.2004.835655","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1344229","","Network topology;Complex networks;Web sites;Lattices;Social network services;Robust stability;IP networks;Feedback control;Microscopy;Internet","nonlinear dynamical systems;graph theory;network topology;network analysis;stability;synchronisation","complex dynamical network;network topology complexity;random networks;scale-free networks;local feedback control;virtual control;microscopic dynamics;pinning schemes;local controllers;graph theory;synchronization phenomenon;stabilization process","","684","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To support this, the high-frequency impedances of an SMPM machine are analyzed by finite-element analysis (FEA) and compared with measurement results using a pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) inverter system under various injection conditions. The results of the FEA and measurements are coincident with each other with some errors due to the nonlinear behavior of the PWM inverter and the SMPM machine. The analysis results give physical insights into selecting the injection conditions for sensorless operation of the SMPM machine even though adjustments considering nonlinear behaviors of PWM inverters are required in the actual operation for the desired performance.

The related field of human-computer interaction (HCI) offers important insights, however autonomous robots are a very different technology from desktop computers. In this paper, we look at the field of HRI from an HCI perspective, pointing out important similarities yet significant differences that may ultimately make HRI a distinct area of inquiry.

One of the main advantages of this communication technique is that it distributes the use of power throughout the hops. This implies longer battery life and lower interference introduced to the rest of the network. In this context, this paper investigates the optimal allocation of power over these links/hops for a given power budget. All hops are assumed to be subject to independent Rayleigh fading. Outage probability which is the probability that the link quality from source to destination falls below a certain threshold is used as the optimization criterion. Numerical results show that optimizing the allocation of power enhances the system performance, especially if the links are highly unbalanced in terms of their average fading power or if the number of hops is large. Interestingly, they also show that nonregenerative systems with optimum power allocation can outperform regenerative systems with no power optimization.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2004.833447","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1374908","Collaborative/cooperative/multiuser diversity;outage probability;Rayleigh fading;transmission with relays","Relays;Rayleigh channels;Power system relaying;Batteries;Interference;Context;Base stations;System performance;Transmitters;Resource management","Rayleigh channels;radio links;radiofrequency interference;probability;optimisation;radio repeaters","optimal power allocation;Rayleigh-fading channel;relayed transmission;power throughout;nonregenerative system;regenerative system","","431","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"LLVM: a compilation framework for lifelong program analysis & transformation","C. Lattner; V.

CGO 2004.","","2004","","","75","86","We describe LLVM (low level virtual machine), a compiler framework designed to support transparent, lifelong program analysis and transformation for arbitrary programs, by providing high-level information to compiler transformations at compile-time, link-time, run-time, and in idle time between runs. LLVM defines a common, low-level code representation in static single assignment (SSA) form, with several novel features: a simple, language-independent type-system that exposes the primitives commonly used to implement high-level language features; an instruction for typed address arithmetic; and a simple mechanism that can be used to implement the exception handling features of high-level languages (and setjmp/longjmp in C) uniformly and efficiently. The LLVM compiler framework and code representation together provide a combination of key capabilities that are important for practical, lifelong analysis and transformation of programs. To our knowledge, no existing compilation approach provides all these capabilities. We describe the design of the LLVM representation and compiler framework, and evaluate the design in three ways: (a) the size and effectiveness of the representation, including the type information it provides; (b) compiler performance for several interprocedural problems; and (c) illustrative examples of the benefits LLVM provides for several challenging compiler problems.","","0-7695-2102-9","10.1109/CGO.2004.1281665","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1281665","","Information analysis;Program processors;Performance analysis;High level languages;Virtual machining;Runtime;Arithmetic;Application software;Software safety;Algorithm design and analysis","program diagnostics;virtual machines;C language;exception handling;optimising compilers","program analysis;program transformation;low level virtual machine;compiler framework;compiler transformations;code representation;static single assignment form;language-independent type-system;typed address arithmetic;exception handling;compiler performance","","1268","","44","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The unit commitment problem is initially formulated as a chance constrained optimization problem in which we require that the load be met with a specified high probability over the entire time horizon. The solution procedure consists of solving a sequence of deterministic versions of the unit commitment problem that converge to the solution of the chance constrained program. For the deterministic unit commitment problems, Lagrangian relaxation is used to separate the dual problem into its subproblems. Each subproblem is solved by a dynamic program. The initial results indicate that accounting for the correlation structure of the hourly loads reduces the value of the objective function when the optimization problem is formulated as a chance constrained program. Monte Carlo simulation is used to verify the accuracy of the solution provided by the algorithm. The relationship that the unit commitment solution found using the chance constrained optimization approach has with that found using conventional spinning reserves is discussed.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2004.831651","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1318698","","Stochastic processes;Power generation;Costs;Gaussian distribution;Constraint optimization;Lagrangian functions;Distribution functions;Spinning;Fuels;Industrial engineering","stochastic processes;Monte Carlo methods;power generation scheduling;dynamic programming;electricity supply industry","stochastic unit commitment;constrained programming;power generating systems;Lagrangian relaxation;Monte Carlo simulation;electric power generation;spinning reserves;dynamic programming","","155","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The operation of these filters is described with respect to the design and system limitations. The operating constraints are then superimposed. The development of this approach shows that there are design limitations and large system changes or modifications can result in higher distortion or even damage to filters in extreme cases. The constraints and limitations that a designer faces in implementing an effective filter design with modern tools of harmonic analysis, measurements, and system analysis are discussed.

If it is capable of supplying enough power at all times, then it is an adequate source. Major problems presently facing the industry include the size, cost, and efficiency of the energy source. The primary energy source presently used in automotive systems is a battery. In order to reduce the cost of the battery, the current needs to be decreased and stabilized so it is not very erratic. The purpose of this paper is to introduce and justify the use of a new model for an energy source: a battery in parallel with an ultra-capacitor. The ultra-capacitor can supply a large burst of current, but cannot store much energy. Conversely, the battery can store mass amounts of energy; however, without expensive and inefficient units, a battery cannot provide the current that the ultra-capacitor can. By combining the two energy sources in parallel, the storage and peak current characteristics desired can be achieved. The standards of the vehicle are not degraded, allowing this to be a promising technique to incorporate into hybrid electric vehicles to reduce their cost and increase the efficiency of their energy-source system.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2003.822004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1262142","","Hybrid electric vehicles;Costs;Energy storage;Power supplies;Degradation;Propulsion;Power electronics;Power demand;Battery powered vehicles;Heart","hybrid electric vehicles;battery powered vehicles;secondary cells;capacitor storage","ADVISOR-based model;battery;ultra-capacitor energy source;hybrid electric vehicles;automotive systems;peak current characteristics","","156","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Gabor-based kernel PCA with fractional power polynomial models for face recognition","Chengjun Liu","Dept. of Comput. Sci., New Jersey Inst. of Technol., Newark, NJ, USA","IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","","2004","26","5","572","581","This paper presents a novel Gabor-based kernel principal component analysis (PCA) method by integrating the Gabor wavelet representation of face images and the kernel PCA method for face recognition. Gabor wavelets first derive desirable facial features characterized by spatial frequency, spatial locality, and orientation selectivity to cope with the variations due to illumination and facial expression changes. The kernel PCA method is then extended to include fractional power polynomial models for enhanced face recognition performance. A fractional power polynomial, however, does not necessarily define a kernel function, as it might not define a positive semidefinite Gram matrix. Note that the sigmoid kernels, one of the three classes of widely used kernel functions (polynomial kernels, Gaussian kernels, and sigmoid kernels), do not actually define a positive semidefinite Gram matrix either. Nevertheless, the sigmoid kernels have been successfully used in practice, such as in building support vector machines. In order to derive real kernel PCA features, we apply only those kernel PCA eigenvectors that are associated with positive eigenvalues. The feasibility of the Gabor-based kernel PCA method with fractional power polynomial models has been successfully tested on both frontal and pose-angled face recognition, using two data sets from the FERET database and the CMU PIE database, respectively. The FERET data set contains 600 frontal face images of 200 subjects, while the PIE data set consists of 680 images across five poses (left and right profiles, left and right half profiles, and frontal view) with two different facial expressions (neutral and smiling) of 68 subjects. The effectiveness of the Gabor-based kernel PCA method with fractional power polynomial models is shown in terms of both absolute performance indices and comparative performance against the PCA method, the kernel PCA method with polynomial kernels, the kernel PCA method with fractional power polynomial models, the Gabor wavelet-based PCA method, and the Gabor wavelet-based kernel PCA method with polynomial kernels.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2004.1273927","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1273927","","Kernel;Principal component analysis;Polynomials;Face recognition;Image databases;Spatial databases;Wavelet analysis;Facial features;Frequency;Lighting","face recognition;visual databases;principal component analysis;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;polynomial matrices","frontal face recognition;pose-angled face recognition;Gabor-based kernel PCA;principal component analysis;fractional power polynomial models;Gabor wavelet representation;face images;spatial frequency;spatial locality;orientation selectivity;facial expression;kernel function;positive semidefinite Gram matrix;sigmoid kernels;polynomial kernels;Gaussian kernels;support vector machines;eigenvectors;eigenvalues;spatial database","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Face;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photography;Principal Component Analysis;Principle-Based Ethics;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique","361","","51","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The required general reversible integer transform and the necessary conditions to avoid underflow and overflow are derived for any vector of arbitrary length. Also, the potential payload size that can be embedded into a host image is discussed, and a feedback system for controlling this size is developed. In addition, to maximize the amount of data that can be hidden into an image, the embedding algorithm can be applied recursively across the color components. Simulation results using spatial triplets, spatial quads, cross-color triplets, and cross-color quads are presented and compared with the existing reversible watermarking algorithms.

PSIM was originally made for simulating power electronic converters and motor drives. This user-friendly simulation package is able to simulate electric/electronic circuits; however, it has no capability for simulating the entire system of an automobile.

Over the last few years, a number of low cost inertial sensors have become available. Although they exhibit large errors, GPS measurements can be used correct the INS and sensor errors to provide high accuracy real-time navigation. The integration of GPS and INS measurements is usually achieved using a Kalman filter. The measurement and process noise matrices used in the Kalman filter represent the stochastic properties of the GPS and INS systems respectively. Traditionally they are defined a priori and remain constant throughout a processing run. In reality, the stochastic properties of the system vary depending on factors such as vehicle dynamics and environmental conditions. This is particularly an issue for low cost inertial sensors where the initial sensor errors can be large, and experience significant temporal variation. This paper investigates three adaptive Kalman filtering algorithms that can be used to improve the estimation of the stochastic properties of a low cost INS. The algorithms are tested using a low cost Crossbow MEMS IMU integrated with carrier phase GPS for a marine application. The adaptive Kalman filtering algorithms are shown to reduce the dependence on the a priori information used in the filter. This results in a reduction in the time required to initialise the sensor errors and align the INS, and results in an improvement in navigation performance.","","0-7803-8416-4","10.1109/PLANS.2004.1308998","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1308998","","Kalman filters;Filtering algorithms;Global Positioning System;Costs;Error correction;Stochastic systems;Stochastic resonance;Inertial navigation;Position measurement;Noise measurement","Global Positioning System;adaptive Kalman filters;attitude control;inertial navigation","adaptive Kalman filtering algorithms;integrating GPS;low cost INS;Inertial Navigation Systems;positioning;attitude determination;high accuracy real-time navigation;stochastic properties;vehicle dynamics;environmental conditions;low cost inertial sensors;low cost Crossbow MEMS IMU;carrier phase GPS;marine application","","68","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the presence of a fault, a nominal controller guarantees the boundedness of all the system signals until the fault is detected. Then the controller is reconfigured after fault detection and also after fault isolation, to improve the control performance by using the fault information generated by the diagnosis module.

Also distribution management system (DMS) have advanced and include more sophisticated analysis tools. The combination of these developments is providing a platform for development of distribution system state estimation (DSE). A branch-current-based three-phase state estimation algorithm for distribution systems has been developed and tested. This method chooses the magnitude and phase angle of the branch current as the state variables. Because of the limited number of real-time measurements in the distribution system, the state estimator can not acquire enough real-time measurements for convergence, so pseudo-measurements are necessary for distribution system state estimator. The load estimated at every node from the AMR systems is used as a pseudo-measurement for the state estimator. The algorithm has been tested on three IEEE radial test feeders. In addition to this new strategy for DSE, another issue is meter-placement. This topic includes the type of measurement as well as the location of the measurement. Our results show the impact of these two issues on accuracy. Several general meter rules based on this analysis are outlined.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2003.821426","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1266570","","State estimation;SCADA systems;Meter reading;Automatic meter reading;Real time systems;Jacobian matrices;Testing;Instruments;Loss measurement;Voltage","automatic meter reading;power system state estimation;distribution networks;power measurement;SCADA systems","distribution management system;branch current-based distribution system;state estimation algorithm;meter placement impact;phase angle;real time measurement;pseudo measurement;AMR system;SCADA system;automated meter reading system;supervisory control and data acquisition system","","173","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, the applicability of dynamic-converter-supplied RF PAs' efficiency-enhancement schemes is compared and evaluated for code-division multiple-access (CDMA) applications. The tradeoffs involved in designing switching converters with wide bandwidth (BW) and high efficiency over Wide loading conditions are considered. Given the highly variable nature of the batteries (e.g., 2.7-4.2 V for Li ion), to operate the systems at their peak performance levels, even when the battery is close to fully discharged, and to achieve higher average efficiency, a power-trucking dynamically adaptive noninverting buck-boost converter-supplied PA topology is proposed. To demonstrate the validity of the scheme, a prototype system was designed and tested using a 915-MHz carrier frequency with a 1.25-MHz baseband BW CDMA signal. The supply voltage for the PA (operating in a class-A/class-AB configuration) is adjusted dynamically from 0.5 to 3.6 V, depending on the input RF power from a 3.0-V input supply, which can vary from 2.4 to 3.4 V. The dynamic-supply PA meets the adjacent-channel power-ratio requirements of CDMA, IS-95 specifications, and the overall error vector magnitude remains less than 6% throughout its output power range from -50 to 27 dBm. The weighted average efficiency of the dynamically adaptive system (6.78%) is 4.43 times compared to the fixed supply PA efficiency (1.53%), which translates to a 88% increase in battery life, assuming that the PA consumes 20% of the total transceiver power.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2003.821256","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1262682","","Radio frequency;High power amplifiers;Radiofrequency amplifiers;Batteries;Multiaccess communication;Transceivers;Energy efficiency;Switching converters;Bandwidth;Topology","UHF power amplifiers;transceivers;mobile handsets;DC-DC power convertors;switching convertors;telecommunication power supplies;code division multiple access","high-efficiency linear RF power amplifier;dynamically adaptive buck-boost supply;power-tracking buck-boost supply;buck-boost converter;CDMA portable applications;energy efficiency;RF transceivers;longer battery life;efficiency-enhancement schemes;switching converters;wide bandwidth;wide loading conditions;adjacent-channel power-ratio requirements;error vector magnitude;weighted average efficiency;portable handsets;hardware implementation;Kahn envelope elimination;915 MHz","","113","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However large grid impedance variation is challenging the control and the grid filter design in terms of stability. In fact the PV systems are well suited for loads connected in a great distance to the transformer (long wires) and the situation becomes even more difficult in low-developed remote areas characterized by low power transformers and long distribution wires with high grid impedance. Hence a theoretical analysis is needed because the grid impedance variation leads to dynamic and stability problems both in the low frequency range (around the current controller bandwidth frequency) as well as in the high frequency range (around the LCL-filter resonance frequency). In the low frequency range the possible variation of the impedance challenges the design of resonant controllers adopted to mitigate the effect of the grid harmonic distortion on the grid current. In the high frequency range the grid impedance influence the frequency characteristic of the filter and the design of passive or active damping (to ensure stability) becomes more difficult. In this paper both topics are addressed and discussed with simulation and experimental results.","0275-9306","0-7803-8399-0","10.1109/PESC.2004.1354843","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1354843","","Stability;Inverters;Impedance;Frequency;Photovoltaic systems;Filters;Power transformers;Wires;Resonance;Solar power generation","power system interconnection;photovoltaic power systems;power system stability;power transformers;power filters;electric current control;resonant invertors;harmonic distortion;power system harmonics;power generation control","grid-connected PV inverter stability;grid impedance variation;photovoltaic inverter;dispersed power generation;grid filter design;power transformer;distribution wire;current controller bandwidth frequency;LCL-filter resonance frequency;resonant controllers design;grid harmonic distortion;grid current;passive damping;active damping;1 to 5 kW","","65","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A laboratory system consisting of a 5-kVA inverter, a 3.7-kW induction motor, and a specially-designed passive EMI filter was constructed to verify the viability and effectiveness of the filter. As a result, both line-to-line and line-to-neutral output voltages look purely sinusoidal as if the inverter were an ideal three-phase variable-voltage, variable-frequency power supply when viewed from the motor terminals.

This leads to its high reliability for personal identification, and at the same time, the difficulty in effectively representing such details in an image. This paper describes an efficient algorithm for iris recognition by characterizing key local variations. The basic idea is that local sharp variation points, denoting the appearing or vanishing of an important image structure, are utilized to represent the characteristics of the iris. The whole procedure of feature extraction includes two steps: 1) a set of one-dimensional intensity signals is constructed to effectively characterize the most important information of the original two-dimensional image; 2) using a particular class of wavelets, a position sequence of local sharp variation points in such signals is recorded as features. We also present a fast matching scheme based on exclusive OR operation to compute the similarity between a pair of position sequences. Experimental results on 2 255 iris images show that the performance of the proposed method is encouraging and comparable to the best iris recognition algorithm found in the current literature.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2004.827237","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1298831","","Iris recognition;Biometrics;Gabor filters;Fingerprint recognition;Laboratories;Pattern recognition;Automation;Feature extraction;Transient analysis;Signal analysis","biometrics (access control);feature extraction;wavelet transforms;statistical analysis;image matching","iris recognition;key local sharp variations;personal identification;feature extraction;biometrics;transient signal analysis;wavelet transform","Algorithms;Anthropometry;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Iris;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Security Measures;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","543","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

BCIs create a new communication channel between the brain and an output device by bypassing conventional motor output pathways of nerves and muscles. These systems use signals recorded from the scalp, the surface of the cortex, or from inside the brain to enable users to control a variety of applications including simple word-processing software and orthotics. BCI technology could therefore provide a new communication and control option for individuals who cannot otherwise express their wishes to the outside world. Signal processing and classification methods are essential tools in the development of improved BCI technology. We organized the BCI Competition 2003 to evaluate the current state of the art of these tools. Four laboratories well versed in EEG-based BCI research provided six data sets in a documented format. We made these data sets (i.e., labeled training sets and unlabeled test sets) and their descriptions available on the Internet. The goal in the competition was to maximize the performance measure for the test labels. Researchers worldwide tested their algorithms and competed for the best classification results. This paper describes the six data sets and the results and function of the most successful algorithms.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2004.826692","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1300800","","Electroencephalography;Testing;Communication system control;Signal processing algorithms;Brain computer interfaces;Communication channels;Muscles;Scalp;Control systems;Application software","electroencephalography;medical signal processing;medical signal detection;neurophysiology;muscle;biomechanics;word processing;orthotics;signal classification;handicapped aids","BCI Competition 2003;EEG single trials;signal detection;signal discrimination;man-to-machine communication;motor output pathways;nerves;muscles;scalp;cortex;word-processing software;orthotics;signal processing","Adult;Algorithms;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis;Artificial Intelligence;Brain;Cognition;Databases, Factual;Electroencephalography;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials;Humans;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;User-Computer Interface","377","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Ordinarily in SOPs, high-performance digital LSIs are sources of EMI, while RF and analog circuits are affected by EMI (victims). This paper describes the following aspects of EMI in SOPs: 1) die/package-level EMI; 2) substrate-level EMI; 3) electromagnetic modeling and simulation; and 4) near electromagnetic field measurement. First, LSI designs are discussed with regard to radiated emission. The signal-return path loop and switching current in the power/ground line are inherent sources of EMI. The EMI of substrate, which work as coupling paths or unwanted antennas, is described. Maintaining the return current path is an important aspect of substrate design for suppressing EMI and for maintaining signal integrity (SI). In addition, isolating and suppressing the resonance of the DC power bus in a substrate is another important design aspect for EMI and for power integrity (PI). Various electromagnetic simulation methodologies are introduced as indispensable design tools for achieving high-performance SOPs without EMI problems. Measurement techniques for near electric and magnetic fields are explained, as they are necessary to confirm the appropriateness of designs and to investigate the causes of EMI problems. This paper is expected to be useful in the design and development of SOPs that take EMI into consideration.","1557-9980","","10.1109/TADVP.2004.828817","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1331512","","Electromagnetic interference;Radio frequency;Analog circuits;Magnetic field measurement;Packaging;Electromagnetic modeling;Circuit simulation;Electromagnetic fields;Antenna measurements;Electromagnetic measurements","electromagnetic interference;integrated circuit packaging;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;large scale integration;crosstalk;magnetic field measurement","electromagnetic interference;system-on-package;radio frequency circuits;analog circuits;digital LSI;electromagnetic modeling;electromagnetic field measurement;return current path;substrate design;signal integrity;DC power bus;power integrity;electromagnetic simulation;crosstalk;electric field;magnetic field","","133","","61","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the most motivating reasons to use simulation is the difficulty of creating a real implementation. In a simulator, the code is contained within a single logical component, which is clearly defined and accessible. On the other hand, creating an implementation requires use of a system with many components, including many that have little or no documentation. The implementation developer must understand not only the routing protocol, but all the system components and their complex interactions. Further, since ad hoc routing protocols are significantly different from traditional routing protocols, a new set of features must be introduced to support the routing protocol. In this paper we describe the event triggers required for AODV operation, the design possibilities and the decisions for our ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol implementation, AODV-UCSB.

A wide range of studies were conducted on two different sized reliability test systems. The studies show that the contribution of a WECS to the reliability performance of a generation system can be quantified and is highly dependent on the wind site conditions.

The basic control for the UPFC is such that the series converter of the UPFC controls the transmission line real/reactive power flow and the shunt converter of the UPFC controls the UPFC bus voltage/shunt reactive power and the DC link capacitor voltage. In steady state, the real power demand of the series converter is supplied by the shunt converter of the UPFC. To avoid instability/loss of DC link capacitor voltage during transient conditions, a new real power coordination controller has been designed. The need for reactive power coordination controller for UPFC arises from the fact that excessive bus voltage (the bus to which the shunt converter is connected) excursions occur during reactive power transfers. A new reactive power coordination controller has been designed to limit excessive voltage excursions during reactive power transfers. PSCAD-EMTDC simulation results have been presented to show the improvement in the performance of the UPFC control with the proposed real power and reactive power coordination controller.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2004.831690","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1318682","","Reactive power control;Load flow;Voltage control;Control systems;Capacitors;Power transmission lines;Power demand;Power system transients;Reactive power;Steady-state","reactive power control;load flow control;power convertors;flexible AC transmission systems;power transmission control;power system CAD;power transmission lines","reactive power coordination controller;unified power flow controller;series converter;UPFC bus voltage;transmission line power flow;shunt reactive power;DC link capacitor voltage;transient conditions;reactive power transfers;PSCAD-EMTDC simulations;FACTS;flexible AC transmission systems","","69","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Different configurations of each architecture, which include a number of novel 4-2 and 5-2 compressor designs, are prototyped and simulated to evaluate their performance in speed, power dissipation and power-delay product. The newly developed circuits are based on various configurations of the novel 5-2 compressor architecture with the new carry generator circuit, or existing architectures configured with the proposed circuit for the exclusive OR (XOR) and exclusive NOR ( XNOR) [XOR-XNOR] module. The proposed new circuit for the XOR-XNOR module eliminates the weak logic on the internal nodes of pass transistors with a pair of feedback PMOS-NMOS transistors. Driving capability has been considered in the design as well as in the simulation setup so that these 4-2 and 5-2 compressor cells can operate reliably in any tree structured parallel multiplier at very low supply voltages. Two new simulation environments are created to ensure that the performances reflect the realistic circuit operation in the system to which these cells are integrated. Simulation results show that the 4-2 compressor with the proposed XOR-XNOR module and the new fast 5-2 compressor architecture are able to function at supply voltage as low as 0.6 V, and outperform many other architectures including the classical CMOS logic compressors and variants of compressors constructed with various combinations of recently reported superior low-power logic cells.","1558-0806","","10.1109/TCSI.2004.835683","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1344222","","Compressors;Arithmetic;Low voltage;CMOS logic circuits;Circuit simulation;CMOS process;Semiconductor device modeling;Virtual prototyping;Power dissipation;Feedback circuits","multiplying circuits;carry logic;CMOS logic circuits;integrated circuit design;digital arithmetic;low-power electronics","CMOS 4-2 compressors;ultra low-voltage low-power compressors;CMOS 5-2 compressors;fast arithmetic circuits;compressor architectures;static logic styles;deep submicrometer CMOS process model;power dissipation;power-delay product;carry generator circuit;exclusive OR module;exclusive NOR module;pass transistors;feedback PMOS-NMOS transistors;tree structured parallel multiplier;XOR-XNOR module;CMOS logic compressors","","162","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The rigorous analytic treatment results in equations purely based on materials constants (relative dielectric constant), well-established fitting parameters (mobility, ionization coefficient), and natural constants (elementary charge, dielectric constant). The results are equally applicable to high-voltage diodes, bipolar devices and junction-FET, but the emphasis is on DMOS structures, which are the device of choice in many applications. Conduction-modulation devices (SCR, TRIAC, IGBT) are not considered here, as the inherent forward diode voltage renders those devices nonlinear at low anode-cathode voltage, making the term ""on-resistance (Ron)"" meaningless.

It is based on a novel learning algorithm that recursively updates TS model structure and parameters by combining supervised and unsupervised learning. The rule-base and parameters of the TS model continually evolve by adding new rules with more summarization power and by modifying existing rules and parameters. In this way, the rule-base structure is inherited and up-dated when new data become available. By applying this learning concept to the TS model we arrive at a new type adaptive model called the Evolving Takagi-Sugeno model (ETS). The adaptive nature of these evolving TS models in combination with the highly transparent and compact form of fuzzy rules makes them a promising candidate for online modeling and control of complex processes, competitive to neural networks. The approach has been tested on data from an air-conditioning installation serving a real building. The results illustrate the viability and efficiency of the approach. The proposed concept, however, has significantly wider implications in a number of fields, including adaptive nonlinear control, fault detection and diagnostics, performance analysis, forecasting, knowledge extraction, robotics, behavior modeling.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2003.817053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1262519","","Takagi-Sugeno model;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Unsupervised learning;Fuzzy control;Fuzzy neural networks;Process control;Neural networks;Testing;Fault detection","learning (artificial intelligence);recursive estimation;knowledge based systems;fuzzy set theory;neural nets;air conditioning;statistical analysis","online learning;unsupervised learning;evolving Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model;fuzzy rules;neural networks;adaptive nonlinear control;fault detection;knowledge extraction;robotics;behavior modeling;online recursive identification;rule-base adaptation","","666","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To minimize the mismatch, the method and control scheme utilizes the resonant tank and freewheeling path in the existing full bridge inverter at the voltage-fed side to preset the current in the leakage inductance of the transformer in a resonant manner. Zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) is also achieved for all the switches at the voltage-fed side inverter in boost mode operation.

Most algorithms that make a hard decision on the origin of the true measurement begin to fail as the FA rate increases or with low observable (low probability of target detection) maneuvering targets. Instead of using only one measurement among the received ones and discarding the others, an alternative approach is to use all of the validated measurements with different weights (probabilities), known as probabilistic data association (PDA). This paper presents an overview of the PDA technique and its application for different target tracking scenarios. First, it describes the use of the PDA technique for tracking low observable targets with passive sonar measurements. This target motion analysis is an application of the PDA technique, in conjunction with the maximum-likelihood approach, for target motion parameter estimation via a batch procedure. Then, the PDA technique for tracking highly maneuvering targets and for radar resource management is illustrated with recursive state estimation using the interacting multiple model estimator combined with PDA. Finally, a sliding window (which can also expand and contract) parameter estimator using the PDA approach for tracking the state of a maneuvering target using measurements from an electrooptical sensor is presented.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2003.823149","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1271405","","Target tracking;Radar tracking;State estimation;Motion analysis;Parameter estimation;Clutter;Birth disorders;Object detection;Weight measurement;Sonar measurements","clutter;probability;target tracking;statistical analysis","probabilistic data association;target tracking;clutter;algorithms;target detection;passive sonar measurements;radar resource management;electrooptical sensor;false alarms;data association","","146","","60","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, there has been a growing interest in the use of TDE based locator for applications such as automatic camera steering in a room conferencing environment where microphone sensors receive not only the direct-path signal, but also attenuated and delayed replicas of the source signal due to reflections from boundaries and objects in the room. This multipath propagation effect introduces echoes and spectral distortions into the observation signal, termed as reverberation, which severely deteriorates a TDE algorithm in its performance. This paper deals with the TDE problem with emphasis on combating reverberation using multiple microphone sensors. The multichannel cross correlation coefficient (MCCC) is rederived here, in a new way, to connect it to the well-known linear interpolation technique. Some interesting properties and bounds of the MCCC are discussed and a recursive algorithm is introduced so that the MCCC can be estimated and updated efficiently when new data snapshots are available. We then apply the MCCC to the TDE problem. The resulting new algorithm can be treated as a natural generalization of the generalized cross correlation (GCC) TDE method to the multichannel case. It is shown that this new algorithm can take advantage of the redundancy provided by multiple microphone sensors to improve TDE against both reverberation and noise. Experiments confirm that the relative time-delay estimation accuracy increases with the number of sensors.","1558-2353","","10.1109/TSA.2004.833008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1323087","","Interpolation;Microphones;Reverberation;Time measurement;Time difference of arrival;Cameras;Delay;Reflection;Distortion;Recursive estimation","delay estimation;interpolation;correlation methods;reverberation;microphones;recursive estimation;direction-of-arrival estimation;acoustic signal processing","time-delay estimation;linear interpolation;multichannel cross correlation coefficient;time difference of arrival;automatic camera steering;room conferencing environment;multipath propagation;reverberation;multiple microphone sensor;recursive algorithm","","122","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the tuning of the PID control systems is not always easy, because of its simple control structure for wide class of process characteristics. What is a widely applicable and simple process controller with an easy tuning and good control performance? This is a motivation of the paper. Prof. Hidenori Kimura of Univ. of Tokyo proposed ""morel driven control (MDC) concept"" at CDC2000 Sydney. He defined a model driven control as a control system architecture, which uses a model of the plant as a principal component of controller. PIDrd, PPI (predictive PI), IMC (internal model control) and DMC (dynamic matrix control) belong to a class of MDC. Features of MDC are simple structure, easy tuning approach and proven stability and robustness. Based on the MDC concept, aiming for wide applicability for even unstable processes, we developed a model driven PID control system, named MD PID control system, combining with a PD local feedback, an IMC and a set-point filter. That was one degree of freedom type. In this paper, we propose a new model driven two degrees of freedom PID control scheme, named MD TDOF PID control, in order to obtain better disturbance regulating property by extending conventional MD PID control system. Through some features and some practical field experiments, the MD TDOF PID control system shows good control performances with easy tuning.","","0-7803-8873-9","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1425994","","Three-term control;Control systems;Control system synthesis;Tuning;Feedback;Predictive models;Industrial control;Process control;Robust stability;Filters","three-term control;process control;predictive control;PI control","PID control system;industrial control system;process control;predictive PI control;internal model control;dynamic matrix control;morel driven control concept","","2","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents the results of a content analysis of 203 randomly-selected Weblogs, comparing the empirically observable features of the corpus with popular claims about the nature of Weblogs, and finding them to differ in a number of respects. Notably, blog authors, journalists and scholars alike exaggerate the extent to which blogs are interlinked, interactive, and oriented towards external events, and underestimate the importance of blogs as individualistic, intimate forms of self-expression. Based on the profile generated by the empirical analysis, we consider the likely antecedents of the blog genre, situate it with respect to the dominant forms of digital communication on the Internet today, and advance predictions about its long-term impacts.","","0-7695-2056-1","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265271","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265271","","Internet;Web sites;Information services;Blogs;Web pages;Environmental factors;Libraries;Information science;Digital communication;Springs","Internet","genre analysis;Weblogs;Web pages;chronological sequence;Internet;content analysis;digital communication","","212","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Noise radar using random phase and frequency modulation","S. R. J. Axelsson","Saab Bofors Dynamics & the Swedish Defence Res. Agency, Linkoping, Sweden","IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","2004","42","11","2370","2384","Pulse compression radar is used in a great number of applications. Excellent range resolution and high electronic counter-countermeasures performance is achieved by wideband long pulses, which spread out the transmitted energy in frequency and time. By using a random noise waveform, the range ambiguity is suppressed as well. In most applications, the random signal is transmitted directly from a noise-generating microwave source. A sine wave, which is phase or frequency modulated by random noise, is an alternative, and in this paper, the ambiguity function and the statistical characteristics of the correlation output for the latter configuration are further analyzed. Range resolution is then improved because the noise bandwidth of the modulated carrier is wider than that of the modulating signal, and the range sidelobes are also further suppressed. Random biphase modulation gives a 4-dB (/spl pi//sup 2//4) improvement, but much higher sidelobe suppression could be achieved using continuous phase/frequency modulation. Due to the randomness of the waveform, the output correlation integral is accompanied by a noise floor, which limits the possible sidelobe suppression as determined by the time-bandwidth product. In synthetic aperture radar (SAR) applications with distributed targets, this product should be large compared with the number of resolution elements inside the antenna main beam. The advantages of low range sidelobes and enhanced range resolution make frequency/phase-modulated noise radar attractive for many applications, including SAR mapping, surveillance, altimetry, and scatterometry. Computer algorithms for reference signal delay and compression are discussed as replacements for the classical delay line implementation.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.834589","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1356052","Doppler;frequency modulation;noise radar;phase modulation;range;sidelobes","Phase noise;Frequency modulation;Signal resolution;Radar applications;Synthetic aperture radar;Application software;Radar antennas;Pulse compression methods;Energy resolution;Electronic countermeasures","remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;Doppler radar;geophysical techniques;geophysical signal processing;radar signal processing;radar altimetry;random noise;pulse compression;phase modulation;surveillance","Doppler radar;random frequency modulation;noise radar;phase modulation;pulse compression radar;range resolution;high electronic counter-countermeasures performance;wideband long pulses;transmitted energy;random noise waveform;random signal;noise-generating microwave source;sine wave;ambiguity function;noise bandwidth;modulating signal;range sidelobes;random biphase modulation;sidelobe suppression;output correlation integral;synthetic aperture radar;SAR mapping;surveillance;altimetry;scatterometry;delay line implementation","","122","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In such cases, the classical symbol estimation schemes, e.g., minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) and zero-forcing (ZF) estimation, require matrix inversion that is prohibitively complex for large symbol lengths. An analysis of the ICI generation mechanism leads us to propose a novel two-stage equalizer whose complexity (apart from the FFT) is linear in the OFDM symbol length. The first stage applies optimal linear preprocessing to restrict ICI support, and the second stage uses iterative MMSE estimation to estimate finite-alphabet frequency-domain symbols. Simulation results indicate that our equalizer has significant performance and complexity advantages over the classical linear MMSE estimator in doubly selective channels.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2004.823503","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1275673","","OFDM;Interference;Fading;Frequency division multiplexing;Equalizers;Frequency estimation;Application software;Bandwidth;Frequency domain analysis;Dispersion","OFDM modulation;equalisers;radiofrequency interference;least mean squares methods;iterative methods;fading channels;matrix inversion","low-complexity equalization;OFDM;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;doubly selective channels;intercarrier interference;time-selective channels;frequency-selective channels;symbol estimation schemes;minimum mean square error estimation;zero-forcing estimation;matrix inversion;iterative MMSE estimation;doubly dispersive channels","","349","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Through spurs compensation and linearization techniques, the PLL bandwidth is significantly extended with only a slight increase in the integrated phase noise. In a 0.18-/spl mu/m standard digital CMOS technology a fully integrated prototype with 2.1-GHz output frequency and 35 Hz resolution has an area of 3.4 mm/sup 2/ PADs included, and it consumes 28 mW. With a 3-dB closed-loop bandwidth of 700 kHz, the settling time is only 7 /spl mu/s. The integrated phase noise plus spurs is -45 dBc for the first WCDMA channel (1 kHz to 1.94 MHz) and -65 dBc for the second channel (2.5 to 6.34 MHz) with a worst case in-band (unfiltered) fractional spur of -60 dBc. Given the extremely large bandwidth, the synthesizer could be used also for TX direct modulation over a broad band. The choice of such a large bandwidth, however, still limits the spur performance. A slightly smaller bandwidth would fulfill WCDMA requirements. This has been shown in a second prototype, using the same architecture but employing an external loop filter and VCO for greater flexibility and ease of testing.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2004.831598","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1327741","","Bandwidth;Linearization techniques;Multiaccess communication;Phase noise;CMOS technology;Prototypes;Frequency synthesizers;Phase locked loops;Filters;Voltage-controlled oscillators","code division multiple access;frequency synthesizers;sigma-delta modulation;phase locked loops;CMOS integrated circuits;radiofrequency integrated circuits;phase noise","/spl Sigma//spl Delta/ fractional synthesizer;spurs compensation;linearization techniques;frequency synthesizer;WCDMA receiver;PLL bandwidth;integrated phase noise;digital CMOS technology;closed-loop bandwidth;WCDMA channel;TX direct modulation;charge pump;CMOS integrated circuits;RF integrated circuits;phase frequency detector;phase-locked loop;quantization noise;sigma-delta modulation;700 kHz;0.18 micron;2.1 GHz;35 Hz;1 to 1940 kHz;2.5 to 6.34 MHz;28 mW","","106","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This radar configuration enables realistic and efficient forward modeling. We included in the initial model: 1) the multiple reflections occurring between the antenna and the soil surface using a positive feedback loop in the antenna block diagram and 2) the frequency dependence of the electric properties using a local linear approximation of the Debye model. The model was validated in laboratory conditions on a tank filled with a two-layered sand subject to different water contents. Results showed remarkable agreement between the measured and modeled Green's functions. Model inversion for the dielectric permittivity further demonstrated the accuracy of the method. Inversion for the electric conductivity led to less satisfactory results. However, a sensitivity analysis demonstrated the good stability properties of the inverse solution and put forward the necessity to reduce the remaining clutter by a factor 10. This may partly be achieved through a better characterization of the antenna transfer functions and by performing measurements in an environment without close extraneous scatterers.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.834800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1356068","Frequency domain;ground-penetrating radar (GPR);inverse modeling;linear systems;soil dielectric properties;soil water content","Ground penetrating radar;Radar antennas;Reflector antennas;Antenna feeds;Antenna measurements;Inverse problems;Horn antennas;Electromagnetic reflection;Soil;Feedback loop","remote sensing by radar;hydrological techniques;geophysical signal processing;ground penetrating radar;soil;electrical conductivity measurement;permittivity measurement;Green's function methods;moisture measurement;radar clutter;horn antennas;sand;sensitivity analysis","ground-penetrating radar;subsurface electric property characterization;GPR signals;inverse modeling;forward model;GPR subsurface system;stepped-frequency continuous-wave;SFCW radar;off-ground monostatic transverse electromagnetic horn antenna;radar configuration;multiple reflections;soil surface;positive feedback loop;antenna block diagram;frequency dependence;local linear approximation;Debye model;two-layered sand;Green's functions;model inversion;dielectric permittivity;electric conductivity;sensitivity analysis;inverse solution;radar clutter;antenna transfer functions;frequency domain;linear systems;soil dielectric properties;soil water content","","302","","67","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Univ., China","IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","","2004","50","1","78","83","Channel variation during an OFDM block leads to the loss of orthogonality among subcarriers, resulting in inter-carrier interference (ICI) in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Many schemes have been proposed to suppress ICI, but they are computationally complex or at the price of sacrificing bandwidth. In some cases, such as high-density television (HDTV) broadcasting and satellite OFDM systems, the very long delay spreads pose the possibility that the channel length exceeds that of the moderate cyclic prefix (CP), resulting in intersymbol interference (ISI) and intercarrier interference (ICI). A time-domain equalizer (TEQ) is usually used in the receiver to reduce the duration of the overall response of the transmission system, and therefore minimize the ISI and ICI. However, the optimum design of TEQ turns out to be a difficult task. The ICI's introduced by insufficient CP and channels variations are different and usually exploit different methods to mitigate them. In this paper, we provide an ICI and ISI analysis in time- and frequency- domain for OFDM systems with insufficient CP over time-variant channels. Basing on this analysis, we propose an iterative method for joint ICI and ISI cancellation whose complexity is linear in the OFDM symbol length. Theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate that the proposed method can effectively mitigate ICI and ISI introduced by channel variation and insufficient CP with high bandwidth efficiency.","1558-4127","","10.1109/TCE.2004.1355879","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1355879","","Intersymbol interference;OFDM;Time-varying channels;Bandwidth;Satellite broadcasting;HDTV;TV broadcasting;Delay;TV interference;Time domain analysis","OFDM modulation;time-domain analysis;time-varying channels;intersymbol interference;interference suppression;equalisers;frequency-domain analysis;iterative methods","satellite OFDM systems;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;insufficient cyclic prefix;time-varying channels;intercarrier interference;intersymbol interference;channel variation;high-density television broadcasting;time domain equalizer;time-domain analysis;frequency domain analysis;iterative method;interference cancellation;interference mitigation","","56","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents a novel ""duty-cycle-shifted pulse-width modulated"" (DCS PWM) control scheme for half-bridge isolated dc-dc converters to achieve ZVS operation for one of the two switches without causing the asymmetric penalties in the asymmetric control and without adding additional components. Based on the DCS PWM control scheme, an active-clamp branch comprising an auxiliary switch and a diode is added across the isolation transformer primary winding in the half-bridge converter to achieve ZVS for the other main switch by utilizing energy stored in the transformer leakage inductance. Moreover, the auxiliary switch also operates at ZVS and zero-current switching (ZCS) conditions. Furthermore, during the off-time period, the ringing resulted from the oscillation between the transformer leakage inductance and the junction capacitance of two switches is eliminated owing to the active-clamp branch and DCS PWM control scheme. Hence, switching losses and leakage-inductance-related losses are significantly reduced, which provides the converter with the potential to operate at higher efficiencies and higher switching frequencies. The principle of operation and key features of the proposed DCS PWM control scheme and two ZVS half-bridge topologies are illustrated and experimentally verified.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2004.830052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1310381","","DC-DC power converters;Pulse width modulation;Pulse width modulation converters;Switches;Zero voltage switching;Switching converters;Distributed control;Inductance;Zero current switching;Stress","DC-DC power convertors;PWM power convertors;MOSFET;leakage currents;switching convertors","zero-voltage-switching half-bridge DC-DC converters;modified PWM control methods;asymmetric control scheme;voltage stress;current stress;duty-cycle-shifted pulse-width modulated control scheme;DCS PWM control scheme;active-clamp branch;transformer primary winding;transformer leakage inductance;zero-current switching;MOSFET;metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors","","76","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Gradient-based multiresolution image fusion","V. S. Petrovic; C. S. Xydeas","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Manchester Univ., UK; NA","IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","","2004","13","2","228","237","A novel approach to multiresolution signal-level image fusion is presented for accurately transferring visual information from any number of input image signals, into a single fused image without loss of information or the introduction of distortion. The proposed system uses a ""fuse-then-decompose"" technique realized through a novel, fusion/decomposition system architecture. In particular, information fusion is performed on a multiresolution gradient map representation domain of image signal information. At each resolution, input images are represented as gradient maps and combined to produce new, fused gradient maps. Fused gradient map signals are processed, using gradient filters derived from high-pass quadrature mirror filters to yield a fused multiresolution pyramid representation. The fused output image is obtained by applying, on the fused pyramid, a reconstruction process that is analogous to that of conventional discrete wavelet transform. This new gradient fusion significantly reduces the amount of distortion artefacts and the loss of contrast information usually observed in fused images obtained from conventional multiresolution fusion schemes. This is because fusion in the gradient map domain significantly improves the reliability of the feature selection and information fusion processes. Fusion performance is evaluated through informal visual inspection and subjective psychometric preference tests, as well as objective fusion performance measurements. Results clearly demonstrate the superiority of this new approach when compared to conventional fusion systems.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2004.823821","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1278337","","Image resolution;Image fusion;Signal resolution;Filters;Discrete wavelet transforms;Distortion;Signal processing;Mirrors;Image reconstruction;Inspection","image resolution;sensor fusion;quadrature mirror filters;image reconstruction;filtering theory;gradient methods;image representation","visual information transfer;gradient-based multiresolution image fusion;single-fused image;information loss;distortion;multiresolution gradient map representation domain;gradient filters;high-pass quadrature mirror filters;multiresolution pyramid representation;discrete wavelet transform;informal visual inspection","Algorithms;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Quality Control;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique","331","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The effectiveness of the scheme was verified experimentally on a bearing test bed, using both supervised and unsupervised defect classification approaches. The objective of the study was to identify the severity level of bearing defects, where no a priori knowledge on the defect conditions was available. The proposed scheme has shown to provide more accurate defect classification with fewer feature inputs than using all features initially considered relevant.

It would be desirable to have an image-to-image transform, which uncovers only the structure of an object for an efficient matching. In this context the contribution of our work is two-fold. First, we introduce illumination invariant local structure features for object detection. For an efficient computation we propose a modified census transform which enhances the original work of Zabih and Woodfill. We show some shortcomings and how to get over them with the modified version. S6econdly, we introduce an efficient four-stage classifier for rapid detection. Each single stage classifier is a linear classifier, which consists of a set of feature lookup-tables. We show that the first stage, which evaluates only 20 features filters out more than 99% of all background positions. Thus, the classifier structure is much simpler than previous described multi-stage approaches, while having similar capabilities. The combination of illumination invariant features together with a simple classifier leads to a real-time system on standard computers (60 msec, image size: 288/spl times/384, 2GHi Pentium). Detection results are presented on two commonly used databases in this field namely the MIT+CMU set of 130 images and the BioID set of 1526 images.

The sum capacity is shown to be a saddle-point of a Gaussian mutual information game, where a signal player chooses a transmit covariance matrix to maximize the mutual information and a fictitious noise player chooses a noise correlation to minimize the mutual information. The sum capacity is achieved using a precoding strategy for Gaussian channels with additive side information noncausally known at the transmitter. The optimal precoding structure is shown to correspond to a decision-feedback equalizer that decomposes the broadcast channel into a series of single-user channels with interference pre-subtracted at the transmitter.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2004.833336","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1327794","","Broadcasting;Transmitters;Mutual information;Gaussian noise;Decision feedback equalizers;Decoding;Covariance matrix;Gaussian channels;Interference;Minimax techniques","Gaussian channels;broadcast channels;covariance matrices;decision feedback equalisers;optimisation","sum capacity;Gaussian vector broadcast channels;Gaussian mutual information game;transmit covariance matrix;decision-feedback equalizer;minimax optimization;precoding","","522","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It enables the eddy current loss in the permanent magnets and the retaining sleeve, if fitted, to be calculated, and caters for motors having either overlapping or non-overlapping stator windings, as well as any specified load condition. The analysis accounts for both time and space mmf harmonics, but neglects the influence of stator slotting. The model is applied to a brushless DC traction machine in which the rotor loss is due predominantly to time harmonics in the armature reaction field which result from commutation events. The predicted rotor loss is compared with the loss deduced from thermometric measurements and from an analytical magnetostatic model which neglects the eddy current reaction field.

Constraints include voltage limits, number/size and locations of installed capacitors (at each bus and the entire feeder) and the power quality limits of standard IEEE-519. Candidate buses for capacitor placement are selected based on an initial generation of chromosomes. Using a proposed fitness function, a suitable combination of objective and constraints is defined as a criterion to select (among the candidates) the most suitable buses for capacitor placement. A genetic algorithm computes improved generations of chromosomes and candidate buses until the solution is obtained. Simulation results for two IEEE distorted networks are presented and solutions of the genetic algorithm are compared with those of the maximum-sensitivities-selection (MSS), the maximum sensitivities selection-local variations (MSS-LV), and the fuzzy set algorithms.

Because of the distance involved in wide-area interconnections, communication delay cannot be ignored. Long time delay may be detrimental to system stability and may degrade system performance. The time delay tolerance of a centralized controller and the associated performance tradeoff is analyzed using a small gain criterion. Special attention is paid to the choice of weighting functions in a robust control design. As expected, it is found that time delay tolerance decreases when the system bandwidth increases, while the nominal system time-domain performance is concomitantly improved. Several approaches which can maintain a good system performance while increasing the time delay tolerance are suggested and compared. A modern controller design technique, like gain scheduling via linear matrix inequalities, is evaluated for the design of the supervisory power system stabilizer accounting for various time delays.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2004.836272","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1350833","Gain scheduling;linear matrix inequality (LMI);power system stabilizer (PSS);robust control;small gain theorem;time delay;wide-area","Delay effects;Power systems;Power system interconnection;Power system stability;Power system dynamics;Centralized control;System performance;Power system analysis computing;Power system control;Degradation","power system stability;centralised control;control system synthesis;delays;power system interconnection;scheduling;linear matrix inequalities;robust control","time delay;supervisory power system stabilizer;centralized control;system-wide data;large interconnected power system;system stability;small gain criterion;robust control design;nominal system time-domain;gain scheduling;linear matrix inequalities;LMI","","248","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our task involves designing the channel encoder and channel decoder along with the controller to achieve different control objectives.

A new sliding-mode control method is proposed for mobile robots with kinematics in two-dimensional polar coordinates. In the proposed method, two controllers are designed to asymptotically stabilize the tracking errors in position and heading direction, respectively. By combining these controllers together, both asymptotic posture (position and heading direction) stabilization and trajectory tracking are achieved for reference trajectories at global regions except the arbitrary small region around the origin. In particular, constraints on the desired linear and angular velocities as well as the posture of the mobile robot are eliminated unlike the previous studies based on kinematics expressed in polar coordinates. Accordingly, arbitrary trajectories including a circle and a straight line in various forms can be followed even with large initial tracking errors and bounded disturbances. The stability and performance analyzes are performed and also simulations are included to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2004.824953","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1308194","","Sliding mode control;Mobile robots;Trajectory;Robot kinematics;Error correction;Angular velocity;Target tracking;Stability analysis;Performance analysis;Analytical models","variable structure systems;position control;mobile robots;robot kinematics;asymptotic stability","sliding-mode control;trajectory tracking control;nonholonomic wheeled mobile robots;polar coordinates;robots kinematics;asymptotic stability;posture stabilization","","251","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To study these questions, we formulate a model of wireless networks that particularly takes into account the distances between nodes, and the resulting attenuation of radio signals, and study a performance measure that weights information by the distance over which it is transported. Consider a network with the following features. I) n nodes located on a plane, with minimum separation distance /spl rho//sub min/>0. II) A simplistic model of signal attenuation e/sup -/spl gamma//spl rho////spl rho//sup /spl delta// over a distance /spl rho/, where /spl gamma//spl ges/0 is the absorption constant (usually positive, unless over a vacuum), and /spl delta/>0 is the path loss exponent. III) All receptions subject to additive Gaussian noise of variance /spl sigma//sup 2/. The performance measure we mainly, but not exclusively, study is the transport capacity C/sub T/:=sup/spl Sigma/on/sub /spl lscr/=1//sup m/R/sub /spl lscr///spl middot//spl rho//sub /spl lscr//, where the supremum is taken over m, and vectors (R/sub 1/,R/sub 2/,...,R/sub m/) of feasible rates for m source-destination pairs, and /spl rho//sub /spl lscr// is the distance between the /spl lscr/th source and its destination. It is the supremum distance-weighted sum of rates that the wireless network can deliver. We show that there is a dichotomy between the cases of relatively high and relatively low attenuation. When /spl gamma/>0 or /spl delta/>3, the relatively high attenuation case, the transport capacity is bounded by a constant multiple of the sum of the transmit powers of the nodes in the network. However, when /spl gamma/=0 and /spl delta/<3/2, the low-attenuation case, we show that there exist networks that can provide unbounded transport capacity for fixed total power, yielding zero energy priced communication. Examples show that nodes can profitably cooperate over large distances using coherence and multiuser estimation when the attenuation is low. These results are established by developing a coding scheme and an achievable rate for Gaussian multiple-relay channels, a result that may be of interest in its own right.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2004.826631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1291725","","Information theory;Wireless communication;Wireless networks;Conferences;Attenuation measurement;Weight measurement;Particle measurements;Absorption;Additive noise;Gaussian noise","information theory;ad hoc networks;frequency hop communication;telecommunication network routing;broadcast channels;Gaussian noise;Gaussian channels","network information theory;wireless communication;scaling law;node distance;radio signal attenuation;absorption constant;path loss exponent;additive Gaussian noise;information transport capacity;regular planar network;integer lattice site;packet routing;point-to-point coding;network coding;multiuser estimation;Gaussian multiple-relay channel;ad hoc network;wireless network capacity;multihop transport","","453","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The resulting tracking system searches for the reference point and tunes the converter for maximum power delivery to a load that may represent an end-user, or an energy-storage element, or a power grid-interface. The proposed design procedure for the MPP tracking system ensures a global asymptotic stability under certain conditions, and a minimum degree of the dynamic feedback. The design is verified using the virtual test bed, demonstrating accurate MPP tracking capability under unpredictable weather change, parameter variation, and load disturbance.

However, when a spammer comes across a service on a honeypot, that honeypot can collect valuable information about the spammer's true identity and help unmask it. In response to the threat that honeypots pose to spammers, the first commercial anti-honeypot technology has surfaced: Send-Safe's Honeypot Hunter (www.send-safe. com) attempts to detect ""safe"" proxies for use with bulk-mailing tools. This honeypot-detection system's appearance, in association with other emerging spam tools, suggests three important trends: honeypots are affecting spammers, current honeypot technology is detectable, and more honeypot-identification systems are likely. The ability to detect a honeypot is unlikely to remain limited to spammers; other hostile or malicious groups could benefit from similar identification systems. In an effort to create undetectable honeypot systems, we need a significant improvement in today's honeypot technologies.","1558-4046","","10.1109/MSECP.2004.1264861","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1264861","","Testing;Electronic mail;Relays;Privacy;Joining processes;Internet;Computer security;Counting circuits;Encoding;Bayesian methods","unsolicited e-mail;Internet;authorisation","spammers;Internet;open proxy relays;originating IP address;commercial anti-honeypot technology;Honeypot Hunter;Send-Safe;safe proxies;bulk-mailing tools;honeypot-detection system;honeypot-identification systems;malicious groups","","47","","1","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Theoretically, all the techniques are quite effective for minimizing the cogging torque. This paper presents the efficacy of these methods in mass production subject to manufacturing tolerances/variations. The cogging torque minimization becomes a challenging task when the requirement is very stringent in applications such as electric power steering and robotics. Some of the known techniques for reducing the cogging torque are the magnet pole design, skewing, step skewing, and dummy slots in the stator lamination. They will be discussed in this paper considering manufacturing tolerances/variations when used in mass production. Finite-element analysis is carried out to determine the worst case scenarios. The research demonstrates that the cogging torque amplitude and frequency are highly sensitive to magnet shapes, dimensions, locations and magnetization pattern, as well as slot/pole combination. In reality, the cogging torque may not be eliminated completely but minimized to a satisfactory level depending on the application requirements.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2004.827469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1300736","","Forging;Torque;Brushless DC motors;Mass production;Pulp manufacturing;Robots;Stators;Lamination;Finite element methods;Magnetic analysis","permanent magnet motors;brushless DC motors;torque;finite element analysis;stators;mass production;DC motor drives;minimisation","cogging torque minimization;permanent magnet brushless dc motors;magnet pole design;step skewing;dummy slots;stator lamination;manufacturing tolerances;finite element analysis;mass production","","151","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By using step-impedance microstrip lines, couplings between resonators can be controlled so that the constant bandwidth requirement could be satisfied with reasonable design parameter values.

Then, the PNN classifies these extracted features to identify the disturbance type according to the transient duration and the energy features. Since the proposed methodology can reduce a great quantity of the distorted signal features without losing its original property, less memory space and computing time are required.

The most important contribution of the paper is a method which first transcribes an optimal control problem into an equivalent problem parameterized by the switching instants and then obtains the values of the derivatives based on the solution of a two point boundary value differential algebraic equation formed by the state, costate, stationarity equations, the boundary and continuity conditions, along with their differentiations. This method is applied to general switched linear quadratic problems and an efficient method based on the solution of an initial value ordinary differential equation is developed. An extension of the method is also applied to problems with internally forced switching.

The Taguchi method is inserted between crossover and mutation operations of a TGA. Then, the systematic reasoning ability of the Taguchi method is incorporated in the crossover operations to select the better genes to achieve crossover, and consequently, enhance the genetic algorithm. Therefore, the HTGA can be more robust, statistically sound, and quickly convergent. The proposed HTGA is effectively applied to solve 15 benchmark problems of global optimization with 30 or 100 dimensions and very large numbers of local minima.

GPR 2004.","","2004","1","","109","111","In a Ground Penetrating Radar(GPR) system, antennas are one of the most critical components for its successful applications. Generally, suitable antennas for a GPR system application can be roughly divided into two categories: dielectric coupling antennas and air coupling antennas. The former includes various dipole elements, bowtie and spiral antennas and so on. The later mainly includes various wideband horns(e.g. TEM horns) and Tapered Slot Antennas(TSA). For developing a GPR antenna, factors should be considered are operation band-width, gain and efficiency, directivity, size and weight, cost and so on. Because of its large size and weight, the air coupling antennas are usually used in the high frequency band, for instance, above 1 GHz. While as the GPR operation frequency below 1 GHz, dielectric coupling antennas are commonly used. The bowtie antenna with loaded resistors is the most one for low frequency application. According to antenna theory, the length of a bowtie antenna should be taken as half-wavelength of its operation center frequency. Therefore, as the GPR operation frequency is very low, for example, at about 10MHz, the size and weight of antenna will be unacceptable if one still use the normal technique to design such bowtie antenna. In implementing our research project, in order to study the subsurface electromagnetic information between 6-2SMHz, a low frequency GPR antenna system is needed. In this paper, the technique for designing such antenna with less size and weight is discussed. The basic shape of the developed antenna is a kind of bowtie. The center frequency of such antenna is about ISMHZ. The elementary theory for designing such UWB low frequency antenna is mainly from broad band biconical antenna and Wu-King resistor-loaded broadband antenna theory. The antenna developed in this paper includes two layers: the bottom layer is used for radiating electromagnetic energy into underground, named as radiating layer; the up layer, which is called as loaded resistors layer, is used for attenuating the current flow along the antenna arm. The loaded resistors layer is folded from the radiating layer and is backed on the radiating layer, therefore the antenna length can be half reduced. The other advantage of such antenna is that it can partly shield the radiated energy into air, i.e., this kind antenna is partly shielded because of its special construction. Its performance for field site measurement in an actual GPR system is also studied.

To facilitate understanding of Z-source inverter modulation, this paper presents a detailed analysis, showing how various conventional pulse-width modulation strategies can be modified to switch a voltage-type Z-source inverter either continuously or discontinuously, while retaining all the unique harmonic performance features of these conventional modulation strategies. The paper starts by analyzing the modulation requirements of a single-phase H-bridge Z-source inverter, and subsequently extends the analysis to cover the more complex three-phase-leg and four-phase-leg Z-source inverters, with carrier-based implementation reference equations derived for all the inverters.

Seal robots have been applied to assisting the activity of the elderly at a day service center. In order to investigate the effects of seal robots on elderly people, their mood was evaluated using face scales (which express moods by identifying the appropriate facial illustration) and questionnaires. Changes in reaction to stress in the elderly was measured using urinary tests. In addition, stress of nursing staff was investigated. Their mental state was evaluated using a ""burnout scale."" The day service center was provided with seal robots for five weeks. As a result, the feelings of elderly people improved by the interaction with the robots.

The former is designed to drive in a specific trajectory. The latter is designed to track the target mobile robot. Then we address the design of the fuzzy target tracking control unit, which consists of a behavior network and a gate network. The behavior network possesses the fuzzy wall following control (FWFC) mode, fuzzy target tracking control (FTTC) mode, and two fixed control modes to deal with different situations in real applications. Both the FWFC and FTTC are realized by the fuzzy sliding-mode control scheme. A gate network is used to address the fusion of measurements of two infrared sensors and is developed to recognize which situation is belonged to and which action should be executed. Moreover, the target tracking control with obstacle avoidance is also investigated in this paper.

Rotor position information is extracted by indirectly sensing the back EMF from only one of the three motor-terminal voltages for a three-phase motor. Depending on the terminal voltage sensing locations, either a low-pass filter or a band-pass filter is used for position information retrieval. This leads to a significant reduction in the component count of the sensing circuit. The cost saving is further increased by coupling the sensing circuit with a single-chip microprocessor or digital signal processor for speed control. In addition, a look-up-table-based correction for the nonideal phase delay introduced by the filter is suggested to ensure accurate position detection even at low speed. This extends the operating speed range and improves motor efficiency.

Although many suitable topologies have been introduced for the case of discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), where the duty cycle value depends on the load level, in continuous conduction mode (CCM) it is more difficult to appropriately design such topologies so as to ""sense"" load changes-due to the small duty cycle divergence under wide load variation. Taking for granted that in order to achieve high power-factor correction in these converters, CCM is a more attractive mode of operation, a drastic solution for this case that will manage to eliminate voltage stresses under wide load changes has become very essential. For this purpose, this paper presents an active clamp topology with small power dissipation, suitable for flyback converters operating in CCM mode. Its main idea is the use of a load-dependent current source, consisting of an auxiliary converter operating in DCM mode. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed topology under wide load changes, establishing it as an appropriate solution in order to develop flyback converters, even at the power range of 500 W.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2004.825342","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1302340","","Voltage;Clamps;Load management;Snubbers;Inductance;Topology;Switches;Switching converters;Power supplies;Power dissipation","AC-DC power convertors;overvoltage;power factor correction;constant current sources;snubbers","active voltage clamp;flyback converter;overvoltages limitation;continuous conduction mode operation;load variation;power dissipation;discontinuous conduction mode;duty cycle divergence;power-factor correction;voltage stress elimination;load-dependent current source;auxiliary converter;snubber circuits","","133","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A general comprehensive stochastic model of the substrate and P/G noise sources in very large-scale integration (VLSI) circuits is proposed. This is followed by calculation of the phase noise of the constituent voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) in terms of the statistical properties of substrate and P/G noise. The PLL timing jitter is then predicted in response to the VCO phase noise. Our mathematical method is utilized to study the jitter-induced P/G noise in a CMOS PLL, which is designed and simulated in a 0.25-/spl mu/m standard CMOS process.

In this paper, we focus on a major class of superresolution algorithms, called the reconstruction-based algorithms, which compute high-resolution images by simulating the image formation process. Assuming local translation among low-resolution images, this paper is the first attempt to determine the explicit limits of reconstruction-based algorithms, under both real and synthetic conditions. Based on the perturbation theory of linear systems, we obtain the superresolution limits from the conditioning analysis of the coefficient matrix.

Conventional methods used for analog validation of the power delivery system fall short in one or more of the following areas. 1) Measurement accuracy in both frequency and time domains, especially for very high-frequency noise caused by large di/dt events. The multigigahertz power supply noise attenuates very quickly away from the die. Conventional approaches of measuring the noise at the pins of the package or at the die using capacitive probes are not accurate for multigigahertz clocks. For this reason, the observability of high-frequency on-die noise has been very tricky. 2) Implementation (e.g., delivery) of analog references to multiple areas across a ""noisy"" die, compactness/modularity of the measurement units, restraining assumptions inherent in the measurement circuit such as periodicity of the supply noise event. 3) Automation to enable a timely volume of measurements. The efficiency of the measurements is key to correlating a particular speed path to poser supply noise.

Modeling the circuits as regenerative frequency dividers leads to very simple analytical expressions for the locking band, phase deviation from quadrature and phase noise. Maximizing the ratio between the injected and the biasing current is beneficial to all the above parameters whereas reducing the tank quality factor improves locking band and quadrature accuracy, though at the expense of current consumption, for given output amplitude. To validate the theory, experiments have been carried on a 0.18-/spl mu/m CMOS direct conversion IC, embedding an injection-locked quadrature generator, realized for the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System. Frequency locking range as large as 24% and phase deviation from quadrature around 0.8/spl deg/ are measured while each divider consumes 2 mA.

This spectral allocation has initiated an extremely productive activity for industry and academia. Wireless communications experts now consider UWB as available spectrum to be utilized with a variety of techniques, and not specifically related to the generation and detection of short RF pulses as in the past. There are many differences between real-world behavior of narrow-band and UWB systems. All wireless systems must be able to deal with the challenges of operating over a multipath propagation channel, where objects in the environment can cause multiple reflections to arrive at the receiver (RX). For narrow-band systems, these reflections will not be resolvable by the RX when the narrow-band system bandwidth is less than the coherence bandwidth of the channel. The large bandwidth of UWB waveforms, instead, significantly increases the ability of the RX to resolve the different reflections in the channel. The UWB channel model developed by the IEEE 802.15.3a standard body is described in this paper. For highly dispersive channels, an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) RX is more efficient at capturing multipath energy than an equivalent single-carrier system using the same total bandwidth. OFDM systems possess additional desirable properties, such as high spectral efficiency, inherent resilience to narrow-band RF interference, and spectral flexibility, which is important because the regulatory rules for UWB devices have not been finalized throughout the entire world. This paper describes the design of a UWB system optimized for very high bit-rate, low-cost, and low-power wireless networks for personal computing (PC), consumer electronics (CE), and mobile applications. The system combines OFDM modulation technique with a multibanding approach, which divides the spectrum into several sub-bands, whose bandwidth is approximately 500 MHz. The system described in this paper has been selected by several key industry organizations [Mulitband OFDM Alliance, WiMedia, Wireless Universal Serial Bus (USB)] because of its very good technical characteristics for the diverse set of high performance short-range applications that are eagerly anticipated for CE, PC, and mobile applications.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2004.834184","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1327872","","OFDM;Bandwidth;Narrowband;Reflection;Universal Serial Bus;FCC;Ultra wideband technology;Wireless communication;Pulse generation;Radio frequency","OFDM modulation;radio receivers;broadband networks;IEEE standards;dispersive channels;personal communication networks;multipath channels","multiband OFDM system;UWB channel environments;wireless communications;RF pulses;wireless systems;multipath propagation channel;multiple reflections;receiver;UWB waveforms;IEEE 802.15.3a standard;dispersive channels;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;multipath energy;equivalent single carrier system;spectral efficiency;narrow band RF interference;UWB devices;bit rate;personal computing application;mobile applications;consumer electronics applications;OFDM modulation;multibanding method;ultra wideband communication devices;7500 MHz","","489","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, we study the effects of carrier frequency offset on their performance and throughput. We further compare the performance and complexity of uncoded and coded transmissions over random dispersive channels, including Rayleigh fading channels, as well as practical HIPERLAN/2 indoor and outdoor channels. We establish that unlike OFDM, uncoded block transmissions with ZP enjoy maximum diversity and coding gains within the class of linearly precoded block transmissions. Analysis and computer simulations confirm the considerable edge of ZP-only in terms of PAR, robustness to carrier frequency offset, and uncoded performance, at the price of slightly increased complexity. In the coded case, ZP is preferable when the code rate is high (e.g., 3/4), while coded OFDM is to be preferred in terms of both performance and complexity when the code rate is low (e.g., 1/2) and the error-correcting capability is enhanced.

Thus, the visual manifestations of rain are a combination of both the dynamics of rain and the photometry of the environment. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive analysis of the visual effects of rain on an imaging system. We develop a correlation model that captures the dynamics of rain and a physics-based motion blur model that explains the photometry of rain.

The phase noise data for a so-called BS-QVCO (-140 dBc/Hz or less at 3 MHz frequency offset from the carrier, for a power consumption of 20.8 mW and a figure-of-merit of 184 dBc/Hz) show that phase noise performances are close to the previously derived limits.

Physical models used for simulations were corroborated by experimental results from SiO/sub 2/ and HfO/sub 2/ gate dielectrics with TaN electrodes. In bulk CMOS results show that, at the same capacitance equivalent oxide thickness (CET) at inversion, replacing a poly-Si gate by metal reduces the gate leakage appreciably by one to two orders of magnitude due to the elimination of polysilicon gate depletion. It is also found that the work function /spl Phi//sub B/ of a metal gate affects tunneling characteristics in MOSFETs. It is particularly significant when the transistor is biased at accumulation. Specifically, the increase of /spl Phi//sub B/ reduces the gate-to-channel tunneling in off-biased n-FET and the use of a metal gate with midgap /spl Phi//sub B/ results in a significant reduction of gate to source/drain extension (SDE) tunneling in both n- and p-FETs. Compared to bulk FET, double gate (DG) FET has much lower off-state leakage due to the smaller gate to SDE tunneling. This reduction in off-state leakage can be as much as three orders of magnitude when high-/spl kappa/ gate dielectric is used. Finally, the benefits of employing metal gate DG structure in future CMOS scaling are discussed.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2004.836544","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1347395","","MOSFETs;Electron emission;Current;Tunneling;Silicon materials/devices;Hafnium materials/devices","MOSFET;work function;leakage currents;tunnelling;silicon compounds;hafnium compounds","metal gate work function engineering;gate leakage;tunneling leakage current;metal gate MOSFET;gate dielectrics;bulk CMOS;capacitance equivalent oxide thickness;polysilicon gate depletion;gate-to-channel tunneling;source/drain extension tunneling;double gate FET;off-state leakage;SiO/sub 2/;HfO/sub 2/","","35","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The studies demonstrate that the proposed PLL also provides a superior performance for power system applications. Derivation of the mathematical model and theoretical stability analysis of the proposed PLL are carried out using dynamical systems theory. Advantages of the proposed PLL over the conventional PLLs are its capability of providing the fundamental component of the input signal which is not only locked in phase but also in amplitude to the actual signal while providing an estimate of its frequency.

Increasing the number of transmit and receive antennas enables to improve system performance at the price of higher hardware costs and computational burden. For systems with a large number of antennas, there is a strong motivation to develop techniques with reduced hardware and computational costs. An efficient approach to achieve this goal is the optimal antenna subset selection. In this paper, we propose a fast antenna selection algorithm for wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Our algorithm achieves almost the same outage capacity as the optimal selection technique while having lower computational complexity than the existing nearly optimal antenna selection methods. The optimality of the proposed technique is established in several important specific cases. A QR decomposition-based interpretation of our algorithm is provided that sheds a new light on the optimal antenna selection problem.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2003.821099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1261322","","MIMO;Hardware;Computational efficiency;Wireless communication;Fading;Transceivers;Receiving antennas;System performance;High performance computing;Computational complexity","MIMO systems;antenna arrays;radio networks;channel capacity;computational complexity","antenna subset selection;MIMO wireless system;optimal antenna selection methods;multiple antenna wireless communication system;single-sensor transceiver;multiple-input multiple-output system;computational complexity;QR decomposition-based interpretation;transmitting antennas;receiving antennas","","266","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In procedures such as gall bladder removal (laparoscopic cholesystectomy), surgeons insert a camera and long slender tools into the abdomen through small skin incisions to explore the internal cavity and manipulate organs from outside the body as they view their actions on a video display.

Clustering sensor nodes is an effective technique for achieving these goals. In this work, we propose a new energy-efficient approach for clustering nodes in ad-hoc sensor networks. Based on this approach, we present a protocol, HEED (hybrid energy-efficient distributed clustering), that periodically selects cluster heads according to a hybrid of their residual energy and a secondary parameter, such as node proximity to its neighbors or node degree. HEED does not make any assumptions about the distribution or density of nodes, or about node capabilities, e.g., location-awareness. The clustering process terminates in O(1) iterations, and does not depend on the network topology or size. The protocol incurs low overhead in terms of processing cycles and messages exchanged. It also achieves fairly uniform cluster head distribution across the network. A careful selection of the secondary clustering parameter can balance load among cluster heads. Our simulation results demonstrate that HEED outperforms weight-based clustering protocols in terms of several cluster characteristics. We also apply our approach to a simple application to demonstrate its effectiveness in prolonging the network lifetime and supporting data aggregation.","0743-166X","0-7803-8355-9","10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354534","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1354534","","Intelligent networks;Energy efficiency;Chemical sensors;Energy consumption;Network topology;Media Access Protocol;Routing protocols;Computer networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Batteries","ad hoc networks;wireless sensor networks;energy conservation;telecommunication network reliability;protocols;telecommunication network topology;iterative methods","ad-hoc sensor network;sensor node clustering;HEED protocol;hybrid energy-efficient distributed clustering;network topology","","446","","39","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two classifications are discussed: decoded relaying versus amplified relaying, and multihop channels versus multihop diversity channels. The channel models are compared, through analysis and simulations, with the ""singlehop"" (direct transmission) reference channel on the basis of signal-to-noise ratio, probability of outage, probability of error, and optimal power allocation. Each of the four channel models is shown to outperform the singlehop reference channel under the condition that the set of intermediate relaying terminals is selected intelligently. Multihop diversity channels are shown to outperform multihop channels. Amplified relaying is shown to outperform decoded relaying despite noise propagation.

For effective delivery of these services, the network must satisfy some stringent QoS metrics, defined typically in terms of maximum delay and/or minimum throughput. Mobile satellite systems will be fully integrated with the terrestrial cellular systems to provide ubiquitous global coverage to diverse users. The challenges for future broadband satellite systems, therefore, lie in the proper deployment of state-of-the-art satellite technologies to ensure seamless integration of the satellite networks into the cellular systems and its QoS frameworks, while achieving, as far as possible, efficient use of satellite link resources. The paper presents an overview of future high-speed satellite mobile communication systems, the technologies deployed or planned for deployment, and the challenges.

The correlation between the acceleration and the distorted PPG signal is analyzed, and a low-order FIR model relating the signal distortion to the hand acceleration is obtained.

Detrapping scales with the logarithm of time and is thermally accelerated with an activation energy of 1.1 to 1.2 eV. Detrapping has only a weak dependence on electric field. These mechanisms are intrinsic, yet there is a wide variation in behavior from one cell to another related to Poisson statistical variations. Common reliability characterization methods need to be re-thought in light of the characteristics of this and other mechanisms. In particular, performing extensive program/erase cycling with no delays between cycles is unrealistic for this mechanism, and alternative distributed-cycling schemes are proposed.","1558-2574","","10.1109/TDMR.2004.836721","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1369194","Charge carrier processes;EPROM;reliability","EPROM;Flash memory;Tunneling;Threshold voltage;Acceleration;Channel hot electron injection;Flash memory cells;Testing;Delay;Interface states","flash memories;electron traps;reliability;Poisson distribution","flash EEPROM threshold instabilities;charge trapping;program-erase cycling;flash memory cells;cell threshold voltage;threshold shifts;charge detrapping;distributed-cycling schemes;charge carrier processes;1.1 to 1.2 eV","","121","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Asymptotic statistics such as the mean, average power, and autocorrelation of the binary quantizer error are formulated using a nonlinear difference equation approach. An important topic of interest considered here is the fractional-N phase-locked-loop frequency synthesis applications, where the input to the modulator has to be a rational constant. It has been mathematically shown that, regardless of the initial conditions, first-order and second-order MASH /spl Delta//spl Sigma/ modulators with rational DC inputs cannot sufficiently randomize the quantization error samples, and, therefore, are not suitable for fractional-N synthesis applications. An irrational initial condition imposed on the first accumulator of a third or higher order MASH modulator, on the other hand, annihilates the tones throughout the whole output spectrum, and provides a very smooth noise shaping. Simulation results are provided to support the theoretically derived results. Implementation issues of the irrational initial condition in the digital domain are also discussed and investigated together with the effect of finite accumulator size on the noise-shaping quality factor.","1558-0806","","10.1109/TCSI.2004.829308","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1304971","","Delta modulation;Phase locked loops;Frequency synthesizers;Multi-stage noise shaping;Noise shaping;Higher order statistics;Error analysis;Autocorrelation;Difference equations;Phase modulation","delta-sigma modulation;frequency synthesizers;phase locked loops;quantisation (signal);phase noise;integrated circuit noise;nonlinear equations;difference equations","delta-sigma modulators;fractional-N PLL frequency synthesis;multistage noise shaping;asymptotic statistics;binary quantizer error;nonlinear difference equation;phase-locked-loop;MASH AS modulators;fractional-JV synthesis;DC inputs","","54","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To reduce the STI-induced stress, we examined STI-wall-oxide nitridation and STI gap-fill-oxide densifying in pure N/sub 2/ ambient.

This makes reconfigurable platforms an ideal target for many modern embedded systems that combine high computation demands with dynamic task sets. A rather new line of research is engaged in the construction of operating systems for reconfigurable embedded platforms. Such an operating system provides a minimal programming model and a runtime system. The runtime system performs online task and resource management. In this paper, we first discuss design issues for reconfigurable hardware operating systems. Then, we focus on a runtime system for guarantee-based scheduling of hard real-time tasks. We formulate the scheduling problem for the 1D and 2D resource models and present two heuristics, the horizon and the stuffing technique, to tackle it. Simulation experiments conducted with synthetic workloads evaluate the performance and the runtime efficiency of the proposed schedulers. The scheduling performance for the 1D resource model is strongly dependent on the aspect ratios of the tasks. Compared to the 1D model, the 2D resource model is clearly superior. Finally, the runtime overhead of the scheduling algorithms is shown to be acceptably low.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2004.99","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1336761","Index Terms- FPGA;partial reconfiguration;operating system;online scheduling;real-time.","Network operating systems;Reconfigurable architectures;Field programmable gate arrays;Resource management;Processor scheduling;Multiprogramming","network operating systems;embedded systems;reconfigurable architectures;field programmable gate arrays;resource allocation;processor scheduling;multiprogramming","operating systems;reconfigurable embedded platforms;online scheduling;real-time tasks;reconfigurable hardware devices;resource management;field programmable gate arrays","","177","","41","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For this, the design of a VCO with powerful output buffer (with good decoupling capability and high output power), comparatively wide tuning range, and reasonably low phase noise is described. To achieve the required high output power, the potential operating range of the output transistors, limited by high-current effects and avalanche breakdown, respectively, had to be exploited using adequate transistor models. The VCOs need a single supply voltage only and have been fully integrated (including resonant circuit and output buffer) on a single small (1 mm/sup 2/) chip, demonstrating their low-cost potential. Experimental results showed, at a center frequency of around 77 GHz, a usable tuning range of 6.7 GHz and a phase noise of -97 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset frequency averaged over this range. In addition, the center oscillation frequency can be coarsely adjusted within a wide range by cutting links in the upper metallization layer. The total signal power delivered by both buffer outputs together is as high as 18.5 dBm at a power consumption of 1.2 W. Simulations let us expect a potential doubling of the output power (for two or four outputs) by extension of the output buffer. To get an impression of the maximum frequency achievable with the circuit concept and technology used, a second VCO (again with buffered output) has been developed. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the measured maximum oscillation frequency of about 100 GHz, at 12.4-dBm total output power (14.3 dBm at 99 GHz), is a record value for SiGe VCOs with buffered output operating at their fundamental frequency. The usable tuning range is still 6.2 GHz.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2004.833552","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1336993","","Silicon germanium;Germanium silicon alloys;Automotive engineering;Radar applications;Frequency;Power generation;Voltage-controlled oscillators;Tuning;Phase noise;Avalanche breakdown","road vehicle radar;millimetre wave oscillators;voltage-controlled oscillators;bipolar MIMIC;avalanche breakdown;Ge-Si alloys;semiconductor materials;circuit tuning","SiGe VCO;output buffer;automotive radar systems;SiGe bipolar technologies;voltage-controlled oscillators;output transistors;supply voltage;resonant circuit;phase noise;oscillation frequency;power consumption;millimeter-wave VCO;SiGe bipolar IC;avalanche breakdown;1.2 W;99 GHz;6.2 GHz;100 GHz;1 mm;6.7 GHz;1 MHz;77 GHz;SiGe","","111","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This method is based on the current distribution on the surface of the antenna. The method of moments (MoM) simulations show that for the IRAs, there are some areas with low current density in comparison to the current density of the feeding points, almost over the entire frequency range. The coaxial cable is attached to the antenna's body all the way from the feeding point to an area of low current density, and extends out of the antenna structure at that point. This tremendously reduces the current density on the body of the coaxial cable. As a result, the current balance between two parts of the antenna is not disturbed. This method is applied to the TEM horn antenna, the reflector IRA, and the Vivaldi antenna. The TEM horn antenna was simulated using the HEMI software, and was fed by an unbalanced coaxial cable, both directly at the feeding point and using this method. This method was also applied to the reflector impulse-radiating antenna. Also, the Vivaldi antenna was fed both by considering the low-current density area and direct feeding. The E-plane far-field pattern of the new feeding method had good agreement with the result generated by the HEMI software for the balanced-fed antenna.","1558-4143","","10.1109/MAP.2004.1388832","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1388832","","Horn antennas;Reflector antennas;Ultra wideband antennas;Antenna feeds;Vivaldi antennas;Current density;Coaxial cables;Current distribution;Moment methods;Frequency","ultra wideband antennas;reflector antenna feeds;method of moments;current density;coaxial cables;antenna radiation patterns;electrical engineering computing;baluns;horn antennas","UWB feeding mechanism;TEM horn antenna;reflector IRA;Vivaldi antenna;unbalanced transmission line;current distribution;method of moment;MoM;current density;coaxial cable;reflector impulse-radiating antenna;E-plane far-field pattern;balanced-fed antenna","","22","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In this paper, we extend the previously presented two-dimensional space-time beamformer design to three-dimensional (3-D), and demonstrate its efficacy using experimental data obtained with a multilayer breast phantom. The breast phantom consists of a homogeneous normal breast tissue simulant covered by a thin layer of skin simulant. A small synthetic malignant tumor is embedded in the breast phantom. We have developed several tumor simulants that yield the range of dielectric contrasts between normal and malignant tissue that are expected in clinical scenarios. A microwave sensor comprised of a synthetic planar array of compact ultrawide-band (UWB) antennas is immersed in a coupling medium above the breast tissue phantom. At each position in the array, the antenna transmits a synthetically generated pulse (1-11 GHz) into the phantom. The received backscatter signals are processed by a data-adaptive algorithm that removes the artifact caused by antenna reverberation and backscatter from the skin-breast interface, followed by 3-D space-time beamforming to image backscattered energy as a function of location. Our investigation includes a numerical (finite difference time domain) and experimental study of the UWB antenna performance in the immersion medium, as well as a study of the influence of malignant-to-normal breast tissue dielectric contrast on dynamic range requirements and tumor detectability. This paper represents the first experimental demonstration of 3-D MIST beamforming in multilayer breast phantoms with malignant-to-normal dielectric contrasts down to 1.5 : 1 for a 4-mm synthetic tumor.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2004.832686","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1318781","","Microwave imaging;Array signal processing;Tumors;Nonhomogeneous media;Imaging phantoms;Breast tissue;Breast neoplasms;Dielectrics;Cancer;Ultra wideband antennas","microwave imaging;array signal processing;planar antenna arrays;tumours;phantoms;skin;medical signal processing;cancer;finite difference time-domain analysis;broadband antennas;microwave antenna arrays","microwave imaging;space-time beamforming;small malignant breast tumor detection;multilayer breast phantoms;three dimensional space time beamformer design;skin simulant;normal-malignant tissue dielectric contrast;microwave sensor;compact ultrawide band antenna synthetic planar array;image backscatter signals;data adaptive algorithm;antenna reverberation;skin-breast interface;3D space time beamforming;UWB antenna;finite difference time domain analysis;clinical scenarios;4 mm;1 to 11 GHz","","213","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a novel technique called LECTOR for designing CMOS gates which significantly cuts down the leakage current without increasing the dynamic power dissipation. In the proposed technique, we introduce two leakage control transistors (a p-type and a n-type) within the logic gate for which the gate terminal of each leakage control transistor (LCT) is controlled by the source of the other. In this arrangement, one of the LCTs is always ""near its cutoff voltage"" for any input combination. This increases the resistance of the path from V/sub dd/ to ground, leading to significant decrease in leakage currents. The gate-level netlist of the given circuit is first converted into a static CMOS complex gate implementation and then LCTs are introduced to obtain a leakage-controlled circuit. The significant feature of LECTOR is that it works effectively in both active and idle states of the circuit, resulting in better leakage reduction compared to other techniques. Further, the proposed technique overcomes the limitations posed by other existing methods for leakage reduction. Experimental results indicate an average leakage reduction of 79.4% for MCNC'91 benchmark circuits.","1557-9999","","10.1109/TVLSI.2003.821547","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1266408","","Threshold voltage;Power dissipation;Dynamic voltage scaling;Leakage current;Subthreshold current;CMOS technology;Logic gates;Capacitance;CMOS logic circuits;Stacking","CMOS logic circuits;VLSI;leakage currents;low-power electronics;SPICE;integrated circuit noise;circuit optimisation","LECTOR;CMOS gates;leakage reduction;transistor stacking;power optimization;voltage scaling;threshold voltage;subthreshold leakage current;static power dissipation;leakage control transistors;gate-level netlist;benchmark circuits;VLSI;noise analysis;HSPICE","","80","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) refers to the retrieval of images from a database using information derived from the images themselves, rather than solely from accompanying text indices. In the medical-imaging context, the ultimate aim of CBIR is to provide radiologists with a diagnostic aid in the form of a display of relevant past cases, along with proven pathology and other suitable information. CBIR may also be useful as a training tool for medical students and residents. The goal of information retrieval is to recall from a database information that is relevant to the user's query. The most challenging aspect of CBIR is the definition of relevance (similarity), which is used to guide the retrieval machine. In this paper, we pursue a new approach, in which similarity is learned from training examples provided by human observers. Specifically, we explore the use of neural networks and support vector machines to predict the user's notion of similarity. Within this framework we propose using a hierarchal learning approach, which consists of a cascade of a binary classifier and a regression module to optimize retrieval effectiveness and efficiency. We also explore how to incorporate online human interaction to achieve relevance feedback in this learning framework. Our experiments are based on a database consisting of 76 mammograms, all of which contain clustered microcalcifications (MCs). Our goal is to retrieve mammogram images containing similar MC clusters to that in a query. The performance of the retrieval system is evaluated using precision-recall curves computed using a cross-validation procedure. Our experimental results demonstrate that: 1) the learning framework can accurately predict the perceptual similarity reported by human observers, thereby serving as a basis for CBIR; 2) the learning-based framework can significantly outperform a simple distance-based similarity metric; 3) the use of the hierarchical two-stage network can improve retrieval performance; and 4) relevance feedback can be effectively incorporated into this learning framework to achieve improvement in retrieval precision based on online interaction with users; and 5) the retrieved images by the network can have predicting value for the disease condition of the query.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2004.834601","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1339430","","Image retrieval;Content based retrieval;Mammography;Information retrieval;Biomedical imaging;Medical diagnostic imaging;Image databases;Humans;Displays;Pathology","mammography;radiology;image retrieval;medical image processing;content-based retrieval;relevance feedback;neural nets;support vector machines;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;diseases","similarity learning approach;content-based image retrieval;digital mammography;radiologists;neural networks;support vector machines;hierarchal learning approach;regression module;online human interaction;relevance feedback;clustered microcalcifications;precision-recall curves;cross-validation procedure;disease condition;optimisation","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Breast Diseases;Calcinosis;Cluster Analysis;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Database Management Systems;Decision Support Systems, Clinical;Female;Humans;Information Storage and Retrieval;Mammography;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Precancerous Conditions;Radiographic Image Enhancement;Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique;User-Computer Interface","178","","41","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A simple transmission-line model is used to calculate the frequencies of the two transmission zeros. It is shown that the nature of the coupling between the degenerate modes determines the type of filter characteristic, whether it is Chebyshev or elliptic.

During sunny days, when the maximum power point of the photovoltaic (PV) array moves very slowly, the sampling interval T, must be set as short as possible without causing instability. If the algorithm samples the array voltage and current too quickly, it is subjected to possible mistakes caused by the transient behavior of the PV array+converter system, thus missing temporarily the MPP. As a consequence, the algorithm can be confused, the energy efficiency decays, and the operating point can become unstable, entering disordered behaviors. The solution proposed in this paper lies in choosing T, according to the converter's dynamics. The choice of the value of T, according to the proposed approach ensures a three-level steady-state duty-cycle swing around the MPP, whatever the duty-cycle step-size and the irradiance level are.

"Estimation of number of spectrally distinct signal sources in hyperspectral imagery","Chein-I Chang; Qian Du","Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Electr. Eng., Univ. of Maryland Baltimore County, MD, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","2004","42","3","608","619","With very high spectral resolution, hyperspectral sensors can now uncover many unknown signal sources which cannot be identified by visual inspection or a priori. In order to account for such unknown signal sources, we introduce a new definition, referred to as virtual dimensionality (VD) in this paper. It is defined as the minimum number of spectrally distinct signal sources that characterize the hyperspectral data from the perspective view of target detection and classification. It is different from the commonly used intrinsic dimensionality (ID) in the sense that the signal sources are determined by the proposed VD based only on their distinct spectral properties. These signal sources may include unknown interfering sources, which cannot be identified by prior knowledge. With this new definition, three Neyman-Pearson detection theory-based thresholding methods are developed to determine the VD of hyperspectral imagery, where eigenvalues are used to measure signal energies in a detection model. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, two information criteria, an information criterion (AIC) and minimum description length (MDL), and the factor analysis-based method proposed by Malinowski, are considered for comparative analysis. As demonstrated in computer simulations, all the methods and criteria studied in this paper may work effectively when noise is independent identically distributed. This is, unfortunately, not true when some of them are applied to real image data. Experiments show that all the three eigenthresholding based methods (i.e., the Harsanyi-Farrand-Chang (HFC), the noise-whitened HFC (NWHFC), and the noise subspace projection (NSP) methods) produce more reliable estimates of VD compared to the AIC, MDL, and Malinowski's empirical indicator function, which generally overestimate VD significantly. In summary, three contributions are made in this paper, 1) an introduction of the new definition of VD, 2) three Neyman-Pearson detection theory-based thresholding methods, HFC, NWHFC, and NSP derived for VD estimation, and 3) experiments that show the AIC and MDL commonly used in passive array processing and the second-order statistic-based Malinowski's method are not effective measures in VD estimation.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.819189","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1273593","","Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Hybrid fiber coaxial cables;Signal processing;Information analysis;Performance analysis;Signal resolution;Inspection;Object detection;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","signal sources;image classification;signal denoising;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;image sensors","spectrally distinct signal sources estimation;hyperspectral imagery;high spectral resolution;hyperspectral sensors;unknown signal sources;visual inspection;a priori inspection;virtual dimensionality;hyperspectral characterization;target detection;target classification;intrinsic dimensionality;unknown interfering sources;Neyman-Pearson detection theory-based thresholding methods;eigenvalues;signal energy measurement;signal detection;eigenthresholding based methods;Harsanyi-Farrand-Chang;noise-whitened HFC;noise subspace projection;Malinowskis empirical indicator function","","605","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This filter is designed to have the variable cutoff frequency according to the rotor speed. And the phase delay angle is so small as to be ignored not only in the low speed region but also in the high speed region including the field weakening region. Sensorless control of a PMSM can be guaranteed without any delay angle by using the proposed low pass filter. The other is a new iterative sliding mode observer (I-SMO). Generally the sliding mode observer (SMO) has the attractive features of the robustness to disturbances, and parameter variations. In the high speed region the switching gain of SMO must be large enough to operate the sliding mode stably. But the estimated currents and back EMF can not help having much ripple or chattering components especially in the high speed region including the flux weakening region. Using I-SMO can reduce chattering components of the estimated currents and back EMF in all speed regions without any help of the expensive hardware such as the high performance DSP and A/D converter.

It is based on a novel polar loop architecture that employs separate feedback control of the amplitude and the phase of the output signal. With this approach, the problems with AM-to-PM as well as AM-to-AM of the nonlinear PA are essentially eliminated. In addition, this architecture allows for a large dynamic output power control range, as required by the GSM specification. The transmitter uses a standard I/Q interface and does not require the extraction of amplitude and phase modulation in the digital domain. The dual feedback loop ensures robust performance even under voltage-standing wave ratio variations without using an isolator. No external PA filtering is required to meet the transmitter noise in the receive band. The EDGE spectral mask is met with an rms error vector magnitude of <3% at 29 dBm at the antenna, corresponding to 2 dB above nominal maximum output power. There is no mode change between GMSK and EDGE, and the transmitter operates seamlessly in multislot Enhanced General Packet Radio Service.

A wide array of model-based evaluation techniques is now available, ranging from combinatorial methods, which are useful for quick, rough-cut analyses, to state-based methods, such as Markov reward models, and detailed, discrete-event simulation. The use of quantitative techniques for security evaluation is much less common, and has typically taken the form of formal analysis of small parts of an overall design, or experimental red team-based approaches. Alone, neither of these approaches is fully satisfactory, and we argue that there is much to be gained through the development of a sound model-based methodology for quantifying the security one can expect from a particular design. In this work, we survey existing model-based techniques for evaluating system dependability, and summarize how they are now being extended to evaluate system security. We find that many techniques from dependability evaluation can be applied in the security domain, but that significant challenges remain, largely due to fundamental differences between the accidental nature of the faults commonly assumed in dependability evaluation, and the intentional, human nature of cyber attacks.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2004.11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1335467","Index Terms- Dependability evaluation;security evaluation;performability evaluation;stochastic modeling.","Computer security;Stochastic systems;Stochastic processes;History;Discrete event simulation;Humans;Performance evaluation;Protocols;Sensitivity analysis","security of data;Markov processes;fault tolerant computing;software reliability","model-based evaluation;Markov reward models;discrete-event simulation;system dependability;system security;dependability evaluation;security evaluation;performability evaluation;stochastic modeling","","263","","171","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The magnet cavities in the IPMSM rotor create a sizable difference in the inductances of the two orthogonal rotor axes. This spatial saliency based on the rotor position makes it possible to use persistent, rotating or pulsating vector, carrier-frequency image tracking techniques to reliably identify and track the orientation of the d and q axes even when the rotor is at standstill. However, additional details in the saliency image must be used to identify the polarization of the magnets in order to distinguish the north and south poles. The magnet polarity is identified using magnetic saturation effects on the saliency image to uniquely identify the polarity being tracked. Carrier currents for both rotating and pulsating voltage carrier injection are derived by using IPM machine model including saturation and verified by measured carrier current components. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms are capable of reliable and fast initial position estimation including the polarity at standstill.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2004.834091","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337065","","Synchronous machines;Saturation magnetization;Magnetic flux;Voltage;Signal resolution;Switches;Mechanical sensors;Detectors;Degradation;Industry Applications Society","rotors;synchronous motor drives;permanent magnet motors;reliability","initial rotor position estimation;interior permanent magnet synchronous machine drives;magnet polarization;carrier-frequency image tracking;magnetic saturation effects;rotating voltage carrier injection;pulsating voltage carrier injection;carrier current","","108","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The driving scheme incorporates two output driving stages in which the output of the first output driving stage is connected to the inverting input and that of the second driving stage is connected to the capacitive load. A compensation resistor is connected between the two output stages for stability. The second output stage is used to improve the slew rate and the settling time. The buffer draws little current while static but has a large driving capability while transient. The circuit achieves the large driving capability by employing simple comparators to sense the transients of the input to turn on the output stages, which are statically off in the stable state. This increases the speed of the circuit without increasing static power consumption too much. A rail-to-rail folded-cascode differential amplifier is used to amplify the input signal difference and supply the bias voltages for the second stage. An experimental prototype output buffer implemented in a 0.35-/spl mu/m CMOS technology demonstrates that the circuit draws only 7-/spl mu/A static current and exhibits the settling times of 2.7 /spl mu/s for rising and 2.9 /spl mu/s for falling edges for a voltage swing of 3.3 V under a 600-pF capacitance load with a power supply of 3.3 V.

One of the major challenges for seamless mobility is the criterion of a vertical handoff protocol: a handoff protocol for users that move between different types of networks. Traditional operations for handoff detection policies, decision metrics, and radio link transfer are not able to adapt to dynamic handoff criteria or react to user inputs and changing network availabilities. Nor are they able to deliver context-aware services or ensure network interoperability. Thus, new techniques are needed to manage user mobility between different types of networks. This article presents a tutorial on the design and performance issues for vertical hand-off in an envisioned multinetwork fourth-generation environment. Various network architectures and technologies for 3G and beyond are described, including wireless LANs, cellular, satellite, and Mobile IP. Then the problem of vertical handoff is defined in the context of such a diverse network environment.

The channel is modeled at the transmitter as a matrix of complex jointly Gaussian random variables with either a zero mean and a known covariance matrix (covariance information), or a nonzero mean and a white covariance matrix (mean information). For both cases, we develop a necessary and sufficient condition for when the Shannon capacity is achieved through beamforming; i.e., the channel can be treated like a scalar channel and one-dimensional codes can be used to achieve capacity. We also provide a waterpouring interpretation of our results and find that less channel uncertainty not only increases the system capacity but may also allow this higher capacity to be achieved with scalar codes which involves significantly less complexity in practice than vector coding.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2004.830822","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1310307","","Transmitters;Array signal processing;Transmitting antennas;Covariance matrix;Sufficient conditions;Narrowband;Receiving antennas;Additive noise;Gaussian noise;Random variables","optimisation;antenna arrays;radio links;receiving antennas;transmitting antennas;AWGN channels;covariance matrices;channel capacity;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;radio transmitters;radio receivers","transmitter optimization;beamforming;multiple antenna system;Shannon capacity;narrowband point-to-point communication system;receive antennas;transmit antennas;additive Gaussian noise;covariance matrix;mean information;antenna correlation;channel capacity;channel state information;eigenvalues;SNR;signal-to-noise ratio","","317","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the novel features of our approach is that we explicitly account for heading rate and velocity input constraints. For a UAV, the velocity is constrained to lie between two positive constants, and therefore presents particular challenges for the control design. We propose a control Lyapunov function (CLF) approach. We first introduce a CLF for the input constrained case, and then construct the set of all constrained inputs that are feasible with respect to this CLF.

The bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonators are shown to have orders-of-magnitude higher energy storage capability than flexural beam resonators. The bifurcation point for the silicon BAW resonators is measured and the maximum vibration amplitude is shown to approach the intrinsic material limit. The importance of nonlinearities in setting the limit for vibration energy storage is demonstrated in oscillator applications. The phase noise calculated for silicon microresonator-based oscillators is compared to the conventional macroscopic quartz-based oscillators, and it is shown that the higher energy density attainable with the silicon resonators can partially compensate for the small microresonator size. Scaling law for microresonator phase noise is developed.","1941-0158","","10.1109/JMEMS.2004.835771","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1341447","","Silicon;Microcavities;Oscillators;Energy storage;Vibration measurement;Phase noise;Acoustic waves;Acoustic beams;Bifurcation;Acoustic measurements","micromechanical resonators;crystal oscillators;elemental semiconductors;bulk acoustic wave devices;bifurcation;phase noise;silicon","nonlinear limits;single-crystal silicon microresonators;nonlinear effects;mechanical nonlinearity;bulk acoustic wave resonators;energy storage capability;flexural beam resonators;bifurcation point;silicon BAW resonators;vibration amplitude;intrinsic material limit;vibration energy storage;oscillator applications;silicon microresonator-based oscillators;macroscopic quartz-based oscillators;scaling law;microresonator phase noise;hysteresis;nonlinear oscillators;oscillator noise;Si","","262","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Werbach","NA; NA","IEEE Spectrum","","2004","41","3","48","52","This article discusses the issues of spectrum allocation and the effect of new technologies on spectrum utilization. To understand the impact new radio technologies are having on spectrum availability, it is helpful first to address a common misconception: that spectrum is a concrete and finite resource. Not so. Radio waves do not pass through some ethereal medium called ""spectrum""; they are the medium. What is licensed by governments is not a piece of a finite pie but simply the right to deploy transmitters and receivers that operate in particular ways. Moreover, interference is not some inherent property of spectrum. It is a property of devices. A better receiver will pick up a transmission where an earlier one heard only static. Whether a new radio system ""interferes"" with existing ones is entirely dependent on the equipment involved. Consequently, the extent to which there appears to be a spectrum shortage largely depends not on how many frequencies are available but on the technologies that can be deployed.","1939-9340","","10.1109/MSPEC.2004.1270548","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1270548","","Radio frequency;Government;Licenses;Satellite broadcasting;Wireless sensor networks;Millimeter wave technology;Cellular phones;FCC;Business;Propulsion","frequency allocation;radiocommunication;interference (signal)","spectrum scarcity;spectrum allocation;spectrum utilization;radio technologies;spectrum availability;government licences;transmitters;receivers;interference;spectrum shortage;available frequencies","","266","","4","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In this paper, the DVR is operated in such a fashion that it does not supply or absorb any active power during the steady-state operation. Hence, a DC capacitor rather than a DC source can supply the voltage source inverter realizing the DVR.

NASA also recognizes the need to increase its involvement with the general public, including areas of information and education. The main objective of this study is to classify the vegetation, man-made structures, and miscellaneous objects from the Satellite Image of NASA Stennis Space Center (SSC), Mississippi, and USA, by using the software, ERDAS Imagine 8.5. The ERDAS Image software performs the classification of an image for identification of terrestrial features based on the spectral analysis. For classification of the SSC image, the multispectral data was used for categorization of terrestrial objects, vegetation and shadows of the trees. These are two ways to classify pixels into different categories: Supervised and unsupervised. The classification of unsupervised data through ERDAS Image helped in identifying the terrestrial objects in the Study Image (SSC). The spectral pattern present within the data for each pixel was used as the numerical basis for categorization. The first analysis of the Image SSC involved the use of generalized Unsupervised Classification with 4 categories (Grass, Trees, Man-Made and Unknown). The result of the Unsupervised Image was used to create another image by using Supervised classification. The key difference between the two images is the ability of supervised image to decipher similar images, such as the roofs of the buildings and the shadows of the trees. Image stacking was conducted to create a fully classified image to separate shadow, grass, man-made, and trees. This poster will describe the procedures for viewing and measuring image, Computer-guided (Unsupervised) and User-guided (Supervised) Procedures will be described on image stacking to view each classification one at a time and stack them into a complete Classified Image. The application of unsupervised and supervised classification in agriculture will be discussed by giving examples of measurement of field reflectance of two classes of giant salvinia [green giant salvinia (green foliage) and senesced giant salvinia (mixture of green and brown foliage)], and invasive aquatic weed in Texas.","","0-7803-8742-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2004.1369859","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1369859","","Classification tree analysis;NASA;Vegetation mapping;Stacking;Geoscience;Educational products;Educational programs;Satellites;Software performance;Spectral analysis","vegetation mapping;terrain mapping;geophysical signal processing;image classification;feature extraction;spectral analysis;multidimensional signal processing","land cover classification;SSC image;unsupervised classification;supervised classification;image classification;NASA Earth Sciences program;vegetation classification;man-made structures;satellite image;NASA Stennis Space Center;Mississippi;USA;ERDAS Imagine 8.5;ERDAS image software;terrestrial feature identification;spectral analysis;multispectral data;terrestrial object categorization;tree shadows;grass;building roofs;image stacking;computer-guided procedure;user-guided procedure;field reflectance;green giant salvinia;green foliage;senesced giant salvinia;brown foliage;invasive aquatic weed;Texas","","10","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Timing and frequency synchronization for the uplink of an OFDMA system","M. Morelli","Dept. of Inf. Eng., Univ. of Pisa, Italy","IEEE Transactions on Communications","","2004","52","2","296","306","This paper deals with timing and frequency recovery for the uplink of an orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) system. The frequency estimator is derived from ad hoc reasoning, whereas the timing estimator is based on the maximum-likelihood criterion. Both schemes rely on the repetition of a fixed pilot symbol. Their main feature is that they provide feedforward estimates and allow synchronization in only two OFDM blocks. In contrast to other existing methods, they do not require that the subcarriers of a given user occupy adjacent positions in the signal bandwidth.

Such amplifiers often operate near saturation and, hence, give rise to nonlinear effects that can degrade performance. The nonlinear effects of an amplifier at a specified frequency may be quantified by the AM/AM and AM/PM, the amplitude and phase modulations or distortions as functions of the amplitude of the input signal. Common design practices frequently attempt to ameliorate the effects of these distortions by providing compensation in preceding stages. Unfortunately, such practices often introduce as much distortion as they remove and unfortunately increase the complexity of the design. The following pages give a description of the design issues and results from a study that indicated that the introduction of nonlinear operation into stages preceding the amplifier had no benefit. Rather, the introduction of such nonlinearity gave rise to additional problems, and linear operation of these stages was preferable.","1090-3038","0-7803-8521-7","10.1109/VETECF.2004.1404827","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1404827","","Nonlinear distortion;Nonlinear circuits;High power amplifiers;Degradation;Phase modulation;Phase distortion;Operational amplifiers;Artificial satellites;Frequency conversion;Nonlinear equations","nonlinear network analysis;power amplifiers;nonlinear distortion","nonlinear circuits;AM/PM distortion;high power amplifiers;amplifier near saturation operation;amplitude modulations;phase modulations;pre-compensation;nonlinear operation;nonlinear distortion","","","","1","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, by increasing the width of the longer monopole, a broadband dual-frequency operation is demonstrated.

The GPDS (sensors and processing unit) is entirely embedded in a shoe insole and detects in real time four phases (events) during the gait cycle: stance, heel off, swing, and heel strike. The instrumented GPDS insole consists of a miniature gyroscope that measures the angular velocity of the foot and three force sensitive resistors that measure the force load on the shoe insole at the heel and the metatarsal bones. The extracted gait-phase signal is transmitted from the embedded microcontroller to the electrical stimulator and used in a finite state control scheme to time the electrical stimulation sequences. The electrical stimulations induce muscle contractions in the paralyzed muscles leading to a more physiological motion of the affected leg. The experimental results of the quantitative motion analysis during walking of the affected and nonaffected sides showed that the use of the combined insole and FES system led to a significant improvement in the gait-kinematics of the affected leg.

This approach involves two steps. First, to find spectrally unique signatures of pure ground components, usually known as endmembers, and, second, to express mixed pixels as linear combinations of endmember materials. Over the past years, several algorithms have been developed for autonomous and supervised endmember extraction from hyperspectral data. Due to a lack of commonly accepted data and quantitative approaches to substantiate new algorithms, available methods have not been rigorously compared by using a unified scheme. In this paper, we present a comparative study of standard endmember extraction algorithms using a custom-designed quantitative and comparative framework that involves both the spectral and spatial information. The algorithms considered in this study represent substantially different design choices. A database formed by simulated and real hyperspectral data collected by the Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) is used to investigate the impact of noise, mixture complexity, and use of radiance/reflectance data on algorithm performance. The results obtained indicate that endmember selection and subsequent mixed-pixel interpretation by a linear mixture model are more successful when methods combining spatial and spectral information are applied.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.820314","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1273597","","Algorithm design and analysis;Data mining;Hyperspectral imaging;Image databases;Spatial databases;Infrared imaging;Infrared spectra;Spectroscopy;Reflectivity;Diversity reception","remote sensing;feature extraction;image classification;airborne radar;infrared imaging;infrared spectrometers","endmember extraction algorithms;hyperspectral data;linear spectral unmixing;mixed-pixel classification;hyperspectral imagery;spectrally unique signatures;pure ground components;mixed pixels;autonomous endmember extraction;supervised endmember extraction;spectral information;spatial information;airborne visible and infrared imaging spectrometer;noise;mixture complexity;radiance-reflectance data;mixed-pixel interpretation;linear mixture model","","420","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"COBIT and its utilization: a framework from the literature","G. Ridley; J. Young; P. Carroll","Tasmania Univ., Australia; Tasmania Univ., Australia; Tasmania Univ., Australia","37th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2004. Proceedings of the","","2004","","","8 pp.","","The control objectives for information and related technology (COBIT) is a ""trusted"" open standard that is being used increasingly by a diverse range of organizations throughout the world. COBIT is arguably the most appropriate control framework to help an organization ensure alignment between use of information technology (IT) and its business goals, as it places emphasis on the business need that is satisfied by each control objective by J. Colbert, and P. Bowen (1996). This paper reports on the use of a simple classification of the published literature on COBIT, to highlight some of the features of that literature. The appropriate alignment between use of IT and the business goals of a organization is fundamental to efficient and effective IT governance. IT governance ""...is the structure of relationships and processes to develop, direct and control IS/IT resources in order to achieve the enterprise's goals"". IT governance has been recognized as a critical success factor in the achievement of corporate success by deploying information through the application of technology by N. Korac-Kakabadse and A. Kakabadse (2001). The importance of IT governance can be appreciated in light of the Gartner Group's finding that large organizations spend over 50% of their capital investment on IT by C. Koch (2002). However, research has suggested that the contribution of IT governance varies in its effectiveness. IT control frameworks are designed to promote effective IT governance. Recent pressures, including the failure of organizations such as Enron, have led to an increased focus on corporate accountability. For example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 introduced legislation that imposed new governance requirements by G. Coppin (2003). These and other changes have resulted in a new corporate governance model with an increased emphasis on IT governance, which goes beyond the traditional focus of corporate governance on financial aspects by R. Roussey (2003).","","0-7695-2056-1","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265566","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265566","","Control systems;Standards organizations;Investments;Information technology;Legislation;Financial management;Risk management;Pressure control;Standardization;Security","business data processing;legislation;information technology","COBIT;control objectives for information and related technology;information technology;business goal;IT governance;IT control framework;Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002;corporate governance model;financial aspect","","45","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent experimental studies have shown that real deployments have a ""transitional region"" with highly unreliable links, and that therefore the idealized perfect-reception-within-range models used in common network simulation tools can be very misleading. In this paper, we use mathematical techniques from communication theory to model and analyze the low power wireless links. The primary contribution of this work is the identification of the causes of the transitional region, and a quantification of their influence. Specifically, we derive expressions for the packet reception rate as a function of distance, and for the width of the transitional region. These expressions incorporate important channel and radio parameters such as the path loss exponent and shadowing variance of the channel; and the modulation and encoding of the radio. A key finding is that for radios using narrow-band modulation, the transitional region is not an artifact of the radio non-ideality, as it would exist even with perfect-threshold receivers because of multi-path fading. However, we hypothesize that radios with mechanisms to combat multi-path effects, such as spread-spectrum and diversity techniques, can reduce the transitional region.","","0-7803-8796-1","10.1109/SAHCN.2004.1381954","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1381954","","Wireless sensor networks;Wireless application protocol;Routing;Intelligent networks;Power system modeling;Mathematical model;Shadow mapping;Narrowband;Receivers;Fading","wireless sensor networks;radio links;diversity reception;modulation;multipath channels;fading channels;spread spectrum communication","transitional region;low power wireless link;wireless sensor network;perfect-reception-within-range model;mathematical technique;communication theory;packet reception rate;narrowband modulation;perfect-threshold receiver;multipath fading;spread-spectrum;diversity technique","","422","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The three-phase PWM ac/dc converters modeled in the a-b-c reference frame are first shown to be EL systems whose EL parameters are explicitly identified. The energy-dissipative properties of this model are fully retained under the d-q-axis transformation. Based on the transformed d-q EL model, passivity-based controllers are then synthesized using the techniques of energy shaping and damping injection. Two possible passivity-based feedback designs are discussed, leading to a feasible dynamic current-loop controller. Motivated from the usual power electronics control schemes and the study of Lee, the internal dc-bus voltage dynamics are regulated via an outer loop proportional plus integral (PI) controller cascaded to the d-axis current loop. Nonlinear PI control results of Desoer and Lin are applied to theoretically validate the proposed outer loop control scheme. The PWM ac/dc converter controlled by the proposed passivity-based current control scheme with outer loop PI compensation has the features of enhanced robustness under model uncertainties, decoupled current-loop dynamics, guaranteed zero steady-state error, and asymptotic rejection of constant load disturbance. Experimental results on a 1.5-kVA PC-based controlled prototype provide verification of these salient features.

In this way, it has developed successions of robust enterprise grade solutions that in many cases meet or even exceed the demands of the enterprise network. IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN networks are designed to provide wireless connectivity in a range of roughly 300 feet from the base. The lead application being shared over the wireless LAN is data. Provisions are being made to accommodate audio, video, and other forms of streaming multimedia. Wireless security is a major demand in the secure data transferring services. Security challenges such as identity theft, international credit card fraud, communications fraud and corporate fraud are some of the main barriers preventing wireless technologies from growing and over taking the wired technology position. The 802.11b wireless LAN includes a protocol called wired equivalent privacy (WEP) which is meant to protect the wireless network. We have been able to find some major flaws in this protocol which lead the whole system to be insecure and thus unreliable. For example, the cryptographic technique used in the WEP protocol, which is a fundamental tool to achieve the above goals, is rather primitive and can be broken fairly simply.

Monitoring allows one to analyze and recover from detected faults, providing additional defense against catastrophic failure. Although runtime monitoring has been in use for over 30 years, there is renewed interest in its application to fault detection and recovery, largely because of the increasing complexity and ubiquitous nature of software systems. We present taxonomy that developers and researchers can use to analyze and differentiate recent developments in runtime software fault-monitoring approaches. The taxonomy categorizes the various runtime monitoring research by classifying the elements that are considered essential for building a monitoring system, i.e., the specification language used to define properties; the monitoring mechanism that oversees the program's execution; and the event handler that captures and communicates monitoring results. After describing the taxonomy, the paper presents the classification of the software-fault monitoring systems described in the literature.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2004.91","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377185","Index Terms- Assertion checkers;runtime monitors;specification;specification language;survey;software/program verification.","Taxonomy;Runtime;Condition monitoring;Computerized monitoring;Fault detection;Application software;Software systems;Specification languages;Software testing;Computer Society","software fault tolerance;program verification;specification languages;system monitoring;system recovery","runtime software-fault monitoring tools;software behavior;catastrophic failure;runtime monitoring;software system;specification language;program verification","","199","","76","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This design is based on assumptions concerning the frequency content of the acceleration of the movement that is measured, the knowledge that the magnitude of the gravity is 1 g and taking into account a fluctuating sensor offset. It is shown that for measuring trunk and pelvis inclination during the functional three-dimensional activity of stacking crates, the inclination error that is made is approximately 2/spl deg/ root-mean square.

Moisture measurement in oil sample generally gives inconclusive information since oil/paper moisture equilibrium is temperature dependent and takes a long time to be in equilibrium. Direct moisture measurement of paper sample is not practicable for in-service transformers. The measurement and evaluation of the ""dielectric response"" and conductivity is one possible way of diagnosing a transformer insulation condition. In a recent research project, polarization and depolarization current measurement has been used for assessing the condition of oil/paper insulation. The polarization and depolarization current (PDC) analysis is a nondestructive dielectric testing method for determining the conductivity and moisture content of insulation materials in a transformer. On the basis of this analysis it is possible to take further actions like oil-refurbishment, drying or replacement of the winding of the transformer. This paper presents a description of the PDC technique with the physical and mathematical background and some results of PDC measurements on several transformers. Analyses and interpretation of the field test data are also presented in this paper.","1558-4135","","10.1109/TDEI.2004.1266329","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1266329","","Polarization;Current measurement;Oil insulation;Power transformer insulation;Aging;Dielectrics and electrical insulation;Petroleum;Moisture measurement;Conductivity;Power transformers","transformer oil;ageing;moisture measurement;dielectric polarisation;dielectric depolarisation;electrical conductivity;nondestructive testing;power transformer insulation;insulating materials","polarization current;depolarization current;oil-paper insulation;transformers aging;dielectric properties;power transformer;moisture measurement;dielectric response;conductivity;transformer insulation;nondestructive dielectric testing;insulation materials;oil-refurbishment","","178","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Answers to this question are known when A is the concatenation of two unitary matrices and either an extensive combinatorial search is performed or a linear program is solved. We consider arbitrary A matrices and give a sufficient condition for the unique sparsest solution to be the unique solution to both a linear program or a parametrized quadratic program.

Center, Univ. of California, Berkeley, CA, USA; NA; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","","2004","39","8","1282","1293","This paper presents methods for efficient energy-performance optimization at the circuit and micro-architectural levels. The optimal balance between energy and performance is achieved when the sensitivity of energy to a change in performance is equal for all the design variables. The sensitivity-based optimizations minimize energy subject to a delay constraint. Energy savings of about 65% can be achieved without delay penalty with equalization of sensitivities to sizing, supply, and threshold voltage in a 64-bit adder, compared to the reference design sized for minimum delay. Circuit optimization is effective only in the region of about /spl plusmn/30% around the reference delay; outside of this region the optimization becomes too costly either in terms of energy or delay. Using optimal energy-delay tradeoffs from the circuit level and introducing more degrees of freedom, the optimization is hierarchically extended to higher abstraction layers. We focus on the micro-architectural optimization and demonstrate that the scope of energy-efficient optimization can be extended by the choice of circuit topology or the level of parallelism. In a 64-bit ALU example, parallelism of five provides a three-fold performance increase, while requiring the same energy as the reference design. Parallel or time-multiplexed solutions significantly affect the area of their respective designs, so the overall design cost is minimized when optimal energy-area tradeoff is achieved.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2004.831796","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1317052","","Optimization methods;Threshold voltage;Energy efficiency;Circuit topology;Design optimization;Constraint optimization;Circuit optimization;Delay effects;Parallel processing;Leakage current","logic design;integrated circuit design;adders;circuit optimisation;parallel architectures;delays","energy-performance optimization;optimal energy balance;sensitivity-based optimizations;delay constraint;energy savings;threshold voltage;circuit optimization;optimal energy-delay tradeoffs;microarchitectural optimization;energy-efficient optimization;circuit topology;adders;digital circuits;leakage currents;parallel architectures;64 bit","","119","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this context, we generate a statistical model of facial appearance, which is subsequently used as the basis for obtaining a compact parametric description of face images. The aim of our work is to design classifiers that accept the model-based representation of unseen images and produce an estimate of the age of the person in the corresponding face image. For this application, we have tested different classifiers: a classifier based on the use of quadratic functions for modeling the relationship between face model parameters and age, a shortest distance classifier, and artificial neural network based classifiers. We also describe variations to the basic method where we use age-specific and/or appearance specific age estimation methods. In this context, we use age estimation classifiers for each age group and/or classifiers for different clusters of subjects within our training set. In those cases, part of the classification procedure is devoted to choosing the most appropriate classifier for the subject/age range in question, so that more accurate age estimates can be obtained. We also present comparative results concerning the performance of humans and computers in the task of age estimation.

A customised library of categorised network components allows for quick, easy and efficient model construction and testing of system or network performance. The simulation model possesses the ability to communicate with external applications such as sophisticated and specialised battery management activities, which allow short-term monitoring and control algorithms for simulating process level interaction, long-term monitoring and supervision at the gateway level and knowledge and data management at the remote management level.

The converter is based on extending a previously developed unidirectional ZCS flyback converter and replacing the output diode with a controlled switch, which acts as either a rectifier or a power control switch in the corresponding power flow direction. By adding an auxiliary winding in the coupled inductor, a switch, and a capacitor, the hard-switching design is converted into a soft-switching one. The technique utilizes the leakage inductance of the flyback coupled inductor to create zero-current-switching conditions for all switches in both power flow directions, leading to reduced switching losses, stresses, and electromagnetic interference. The operating principles of the converter and experimental results have been presented.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2004.836643","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1353333","Bidirectional power conversion;power supplies;resonant power conversion","Zero current switching;DC-DC power converters;Switches;Switching converters;Load flow;Inductors;Diodes;Rectifiers;Power control;Capacitors","zero current switching;DC-DC power convertors;power inductors;losses;load flow;electromagnetic interference;switching convertors","ZCS bidirectional flyback dc/dc converter;zero-current-switched;unidirectional ZCS flyback converter;controlled switch;rectifier;power control switch;power flow direction;auxiliary winding;coupled inductor;capacitor;leakage inductance;electromagnetic interference reduction;switching loss reduction;stress reduction","","53","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A main component in a smart antenna system is beamforming. Because of the limitations of analog beamforming, digital beamforming will be employed in future satellite communication systems. We evaluate the performance of various digital beamforming strategies proposed in the literature for satellite communications: 1) single fixed beam/single user, 2) single fixed beam/multiple users, 3) single adaptive beam/single user, and 4) single Chebyshev dynamic beam/multiple users. Multiple criteria including coverage, system capacity, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), and computation complexity are used to evaluate these satellite communication beamforming strategies. In particular, a Ka-band satellite communication system is used to address the various issues of these beamforming strategies. For the adaptive beamforming approach, subarray structure is used to obtain the weights of a large 2D antenna array, and a globally convergent recurrent neural network (RNN) is proposed to realize the adaptive beamforming algorithm in parallel. The new subarray-based neural beamforming algorithm can reduce the computation complexity greatly, and is more effective than the conventional least mean square (LMS) beamforming approach. It is shown that the single adaptive beam/single user approach has the highest system capacity.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2004.1292139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1292139","","Array signal processing;Satellite communication;Adaptive arrays;Recurrent neural networks;Satellite antennas;Antenna accessories;Chebyshev approximation;Signal to noise ratio;Antenna arrays;Least squares approximation","satellite communication;array signal processing;parallel algorithms;antenna theory;adaptive antenna arrays;computational complexity;recurrent neural nets;performance evaluation","performance evaluation;digital beamforming;satellite communications;smart antennas;analog beamforming;single fixed beam-single user;single fixed beam-multiple users;single adaptive beam-single user;single Chebyshev dynamic beam-multiple users;system capacity;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;computation complexity;Ka-band;subarray structure;large 2D antenna array;recurrent neural network;adaptive beamforming algorithm;subarray-based neural beamforming algorithm;least mean square beamforming","","21","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Position Location and Navigation Symposium (IEEE Cat. No.04CH37556)","","2004","","","193","200","A strapdown Inertial Navigation System (INS) can provide attitude and heading estimates after initialization and alignment. Many factors affect the accuracy and the performance of the system. They mainly are: sensor noise, bias, scale factor error, and alignment error. The Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) based on the newly developed MEMS technology has wide applications due to its low-cost, small size, and low power consumption. However, the inertial MEMS sensors have large noise, bias and scale factor errors due to drift. The traditional strapdown algorithm using a low-cost MEMS sensor ONLY is difficultly satisfying the attitude and heading performance requirements. An extended Kalman filter with adaptive gain was used to build a miniature attitude and heading reference system based on a stochastic model. The adaptive filter has six states with a time variable transition matrix. The six states are three tilt angles of attitude and three bias errors for the gyroscopes. The filter uses the measurements of three accelerometers and a magnetic compass to drive the state update. When the system is in the non-acceleration mode, the accelerometer measurements of the gravity and the compass measurements of the heading have observability and yield good estimates of the states. When the system is in the high dynamic mode and the bias has converged to an accurate estimate, the attitude calculation will be maintained for a long interval of time. The adaptive filter tunes its gain automatically based on the system dynamics sensed by the accelerometers to yield optimal performance. The paper presents the methodology of the technique, performs the analysis, and gives the testing results of the system based on the adaptive filter. The whole system can be fitted within the size of 5cm /spl times/ 5cm /spl times/ 5cm with analog to digital conversion and digital signal processing boards.","","0-7803-8416-4","10.1109/PLANS.2004.1308993","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1308993","","Adaptive filters;Micromechanical devices;Accelerometers;Magnetic separation;Inertial navigation;Measurement units;Energy consumption;Signal processing algorithms;Stochastic systems;Stochastic resonance","micromechanical devices;microsensors;attitude measurement;accelerometers;inertial navigation;gyroscopes;adaptive Kalman filters;attitude control;aerospace instrumentation","adaptive filter;miniature MEMS based attitude and heading reference system;strapdown Inertial Navigation System;attitude estimates;heading estimates;initialization;alignment;accuracy;performance;sensor noise;bias;scale factor error;alignment error;Inertial Measurement Unit;extended Kalman filter;adaptive gain;tilt angles;gyroscopes;accelerometers;magnetic compass","","23","","3","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, frequency-domain BSS involves a permutation problem: the permutation ambiguity of ICA in each frequency bin should be aligned so that a separated signal in the time-domain contains frequency components of the same source signal. This paper presents a robust and precise method for solving the permutation problem. It is based on two approaches: direction of arrival (DOA) estimation for sources and the interfrequency correlation of signal envelopes. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches, and integrate them to exploit their respective advantages. Furthermore, by utilizing the harmonics of signals, we make the new method robust even for low frequencies where DOA estimation is inaccurate. We also present a new closed-form formula for estimating DOAs from a separation matrix obtained by ICA. Experimental results show that our method provided an almost perfect solution to the permutation problem for a case where two sources were mixed in a room whose reverberation time was 300 ms.","1558-2353","","10.1109/TSA.2004.832994","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1323089","","Robustness;Blind source separation;Independent component analysis;Source separation;Frequency domain analysis;Direction of arrival estimation;Time domain analysis;Finite impulse response filter;Frequency estimation;Discrete Fourier transforms","blind source separation;independent component analysis;direction-of-arrival estimation;correlation methods;frequency-domain analysis","permutation problem;frequency-domain blind source separation;convolutive mixture;independent component analysis;frequency bin;direction of arrival estimation;interfrequency correlation","","330","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The characteristics of the proposed method are that no prior knowledge about the objects is necessary and the parameters can be set automatically. In our work, an infrared (IR) camera is adopted as the input device to capture the thermal images of the palm-dorsa. In the proposed approach, two of the finger webs are automatically selected as the datum points to define the region of interest (ROI) on the thermal images. Within each ROI, feature points of the vein patterns (FPVPs) are extracted by modifying the basic tool of watershed transformation based on the properties of thermal images. According to the heat conduction law (the Fourier law), multiple features can be extracted from each FPVP for verification. Multiresolution representations of images with FPVPs are obtained using multiple multiresolution filters (MRFs) that extract the dominant points by filtering miscellaneous features for each FPVP. A hierarchical integrating function is then applied to integrate multiple features and multiresolution representations. The former is integrated by an inter-to-intra personal variation ratio and the latter is integrated by a positive Boolean function. We also introduce a logical and reasonable method to select a trained threshold for verification. Experiments were conducted using the thermal images of palm-dorsas and the results are satisfactory with an acceptable accuracy rate (FRR:2.3% and FAR:2.3%).

It considers both the dynamic part and the output part of T-S fuzzy model which guarantees that the controller without any delay information can stabilize time-delay T-S fuzzy systems. Based on delay-dependent Lyapunov functional approach, some sufficient conditions for the existence of state feedback controller are provided via parallel distributed compensation (PDC) first. Second, the corresponding conditions are extended into the generalized dynamic output feedback closed-loop system via so-called generalized PDC technique. The upper bound of time-delay can be obtained using convex optimization such that the system can be stabilized for all time-delays whose sizes are not larger than the bound.

Here, the new strategy called spectrum pooling is considered. It aims at enabling public access to these spectral ranges without sacrificing the transmission quality of the actual license owners. Unfortunately, using OFDM modulation in a spectrum pooling system has some drawbacks. There is an interaction between the licensed system and the OFDM based rental system due to the non-orthogonality of their respective transmit signals. This interaction is described mathematically, providing a quantitative evaluation of the mutual interference that leads to an SNR loss in both systems. However, this interference can be mitigated by windowing the OFDM signal in the time domain or by the adaptive deactivation of adjacent subcarriers providing flexible guard bands between licensed and rental system. It is obvious that both approaches sacrifice bandwidth of the rental system. A quantitative comparison of both approaches is given as a tradeoff between interference reduction and throughput in the rental system.","1550-2252","0-7803-8255-2","10.1109/VETECS.2004.1390598","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1390598","","Interference;Bandwidth;Wireless LAN;Spectral shape;Land mobile radio;OFDM modulation;Throughput;Propagation losses;Airports;Technological innovation","interference suppression;radiofrequency interference;OFDM modulation;frequency allocation;mobile radio","mutual interference;OFDM modulation;spectrum pooling systems;public mobile radio;nonorthogonal signals;interference mitigation;time domain windowing;adaptive subcarrier deactivation;flexible guard bands;interference reduction","","367","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The noise impedance magnitude information aids the design of the EMI filter. Phase information for the noise impedance is not required.

Partial transmit sequence (PTS) technique can improve the PAPR statistics of OFDM signals. In the PTS technique, the data block to be transmitted is partitioned into disjoint subblocks and the subblocks are combined using phase factors to minimize PAPR. As ordinary PTS technique requires an exhaustive search over all combinations of allowed phase factors, the search complexity increases exponentially with the number of subblocks. In the proposed technique, a gradient descent search is performed to find the phase factors.

The traditional approach consists of two steps. First, the least-squares (LS) estimate is obtained over the pilot subcarriers. Then, this preliminary estimate is interpolated/smoothed over the entire frequency-time grid. In this paper, we propose to add an intermediate step, whose purpose is to increase the accuracy of the estimate over the pilot subcarriers. The presented techniques are based on the observation that the wireless radio channel can be parametrized as a combination of paths, each characterized by a delay and a complex amplitude. The amplitudes show fast temporal variations due to the mobility of terminals while the delays (and their associated delay-subspace) are almost constant over a large number of OFDM symbols. We propose to track the delay-subspace by a subspace tracking algorithm and the amplitudes by the least mean square algorithm (or modifications of the latter). The approach can be extended to multiple input multiple output OFDM or multicarrier code-division multiple-access systems. Analytical results and simulations prove the relevant benefits of the novel structure.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2003.819022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259423","","Channel estimation;OFDM;Delay estimation;Frequency estimation;Fading;MIMO;Wireless communication;Signal processing;Mean square error methods;Signal processing algorithms","channel estimation;OFDM modulation;delay estimation;fading channels;interpolation;least mean squares methods;MIMO systems;multipath channels","pilot-based channel estimation;OFDM systems;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;delay-subspace tracking;fast-varying fading channels;preinterpolation channel estimation;pilot symbols;frequency-time grid;least-squares estimate;pilot subcarriers;wireless radio channel;subspace tracking algorithm;least mean square algorithm;multiple input multiple output;MIMO systems;multipath channels;baseband model;batch algorithm;subspace-amplitudes tracking estimator;comb pilot pattern","","140","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Lab., Washington, DC, USA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","2004","42","4","722","731","In this paper, we proposed an unsupervised terrain and land-use classification algorithm using polarimetric synthetic aperture radar data. Unlike other algorithms that classify pixels statistically and ignore their scattering characteristics, this algorithm not only uses a statistical classifier, but also preserves the purity of dominant polarimetric scattering properties. This algorithm uses a combination of a scattering model-based decomposition developed by Freeman and Durden and the maximum-likelihood classifier based on the complex Wishart distribution. The first step is to apply the Freeman and Durden decomposition to divide pixels into three scattering categories: surface scattering, volume scattering, and double-bounce scattering. To preserve the purity of scattering characteristics, pixels in a scattering category are restricted to be classified with other pixels in the same scattering category. An efficient and effective class initialization scheme is also devised to initially merge clusters from many small clusters in each scattering category by applying a merge criterion developed based on the Wishart distance measure. Then, the iterative Wishart classifier is applied. The stability in convergence is much superior to that of the previous algorithm using the entropy/anisotropy/Wishart classifier. Finally, an automated color rendering scheme is proposed, based on the classes' scattering category to code the pixels to resemble their natural color. This algorithm is also flexible and computationally efficient. The effectiveness of this algorithm is demonstrated using the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's AIRSAR and the German Aerospace Center's (DLR) E-SAR L-band polarimetric synthetic aperture radar images.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.819883","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1288367","","Radar scattering;Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar;Iterative algorithms;Classification algorithms;Stability;Convergence;Clustering algorithms;Entropy;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Propulsion","terrain mapping;geophysical signal processing;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;image classification;radar polarimetry;backscatter;maximum likelihood estimation;pattern clustering;rendering (computer graphics);image colour analysis","unsupervised terrain classification;polarimetric scattering characteristics preservation;land-use classification algorithm;synthetic aperture radar;statistical pixel classification;statistical classifier;polarimetric scattering properties;scattering model-based decomposition;maximum-likelihood classifier;Wishart distribution;Freeman decomposition;Durden decomposition;surface scattering;volume scattering;double-bounce scattering;class initialization scheme;cluster merging;merge criterion;Wishart distance measure;iterative Wishart classifier;convergence stability;entropy/anisotropy/Wishart classifier;automated color rendering;Jet Propulsion Laboratory;AIRSAR;German Aerospace Center;DLR E-SAR L-band","","282","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This has led to the development of 3D shape retrieval systems that, given a query object, retrieve similar 3D objects. For visualization, 3D shapes are often represented as a surface, in particular polygonal meshes, for example in VRML format. Often these models contain holes, intersecting polygons, are not manifold, and do not enclose a volume unambiguously. On the contrary, 3D volume models, such as solid models produced by CAD systems, or voxels models, enclose a volume properly. This paper surveys the literature on methods for content based 3D retrieval, taking into account the applicability to surface models as well as to volume models. The methods are evaluated with respect to several requirements of content based 3D shape retrieval, such as: (1) shape representation requirements, (2) properties of dissimilarity measures, (3) efficiency, (4) discrimination abilities, (5) ability to perform partial matching, (6) robustness, and (7) necessity of pose normalization.

The results show that the length of the plasma column increases as the square root of the applied power and that the plasma density decreases linearly from the wave launcher to the end of the plasma column. These results are consistent with a simple global model of the antenna. Since noise is critical to communication systems, the noise generated by the plasma was measured from 10 to 250 MHz. Between 50 and 250 MHz the excess noise temperature was found to be 17.2/spl plusmn/1.0 dB above 290 K. This corresponds to an ohmic thermal noise source at 1.4/spl plusmn/0.3 eV, compared with an electron temperature of 1.65 eV predicted by the global model. Estimates of the electrical conductivity of the plasma column based on measured electron number densities lead to an antenna efficiency of about 65% at a transmission frequency of 100 MHz and an increase in total antenna noise of 1 dB due to the plasma. Theoretical modeling and experimental observations of the radiation pattern of the antenna show that the linear variation of conductivity and finite resistance of the column lead to a reduction in the depth of the nulls in the radiation pattern and a consequent increase in the width of the main lobe.","1939-9375","","10.1109/TPS.2004.826019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1291644","","Plasma properties;Plasma density;Plasma measurements;Plasma waves;Plasma temperature;Antenna theory;Noise generators;Plasma sources;Antenna measurements;Noise measurement","antennas in plasma;argon;discharges (electric);surface waves (fluid);plasma waves;plasma density;thermal noise;plasma diagnostics","plasma antenna excitation;argon surface wave discharge;RF power levels;radiofrequency power levels;gas pressures;plasma column length;plasma density;wave launcher;noise temperature;communication systems;ohmic thermal noise source;electron temperature;simple global antenna model;measured electron number densities;antenna efficiency;transmission frequency;total antenna noise;radiation pattern;linear conductivity variation;finite column resistance;null depth;main lobe width;500 MHz;0.03 to 0.5 mbar;10 to 250 MHz;Ar","","150","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The approach can take advantage of additional information, such as estimated distances between neighbors or known positions for certain anchor nodes, if it is available. It is based on multidimensional scaling (MDS), an efficient data analysis technique that takes O(n/sup 3/) time for a network of n nodes. Unlike previous approaches, MDS takes full advantage of connectivity or distance information between nodes that have yet to be localized. Two methods are presented: a simple method that builds a global map using MDS and a more complicated one that builds small local maps and then patches them together to form a global map. Furthermore, least-squares optimization can be incorporated into the methods to further improve the solutions at the expense of additional computation. Through simulation studies on uniform as well as irregular networks, we show that the methods achieve more accurate solutions than previous methods, especially when there are few anchor nodes. They can even yield good relative maps when no anchor nodes are available.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2004.67","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1339247","Wireless sensor networks;optimization;position estimation.","Intelligent networks;Acoustic sensors;Temperature sensors;Multidimensional systems;Data analysis;Vehicles;Optimization methods;Computational modeling;Actuators;Ad hoc networks","wireless sensor networks;least squares approximations;optimisation;data analysis;Global Positioning System;communication complexity;mobile communication;ad hoc networks;mobile computing","wireless sensor networks;connectivity information;multidimensional scaling;data analysis;node distance information;least-squares optimization;uniform networks;irregular networks;position estimation;network localization","","345","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The tools of density evolution with mixture Gaussian approximations are used to optimize irregular LDPC codes and to compute minimum operational signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for ergodic MIMO OFDM channels. In particular, the optimization is done for various MIMO OFDM system configurations, which include a different number of antennas, different channel models, and different demodulation schemes; the optimized performance is compared with the corresponding channel capacity. It is shown that along with the optimized irregular LDPC codes, a turbo iterative receiver that consists of a soft maximum a posteriori (MAP) demodulator and a belief-propagation LDPC decoder can perform within 1 dB from the ergodic capacity of the MIMO OFDM systems under consideration. It is also shown that compared with the optimal MAP demodulator-based receivers, the receivers employing a low-complexity linear minimum mean-square-error soft-interference-cancellation (LMMSE-SIC) demodulator have a small performance loss (< 1dB) in spatially uncorrelated MIMO channels but suffer extra performance loss in MIMO channels with spatial correlation. Finally, from the LDPC profiles that already are optimized for ergodic channels, we heuristically construct small block-size irregular LDPC codes for outage MIMO OFDM channels; as shown from simulation results, the irregular LDPC codes constructed here are helpful in expediting the convergence of the iterative receivers.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2003.820991","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1261323","","Performance analysis;Design optimization;MIMO;OFDM;Parity check codes;Demodulation;Performance loss;Frequency division multiplexing;Gaussian approximation;Signal to noise ratio","parity check codes;radio receivers;demodulation;iterative methods;MIMO systems;OFDM modulation;least mean squares methods;interference suppression;radiofrequency interference;channel capacity;maximum likelihood estimation;4G mobile communication;optimisation;Gaussian processes","performance analysis;LDPC-coded MIMO OFDM system;low-density parity check;multiple-input multiple-output;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;density evolution;high data rate wireless transmission;Gaussian approximation;signal-to-noise ratio;SNR;ergodic channel;optimization;channel capacity;MAP demodulator;maximum a posteriori;outage capacity;low-complexity linear minimum mean-square-error soft-interference-cancellation","","121","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This way, GNGD adapts its learning rate according to the dynamics of the input signal, with the additional adaptive term compensating for the simplifications in the derivation of NLMS. The performance of GNGD is bounded from below by the performance of the NLMS, whereas it converges in environments where NLMS diverges. The GNGD is shown to be robust to significant variations of initial values of its parameters.

The overall BW of a proposed double resonant antenna is shown to be increased by more than 94% compared with a single resonant antenna occupying the same area. The behavior of miniaturized slot antennas, loaded with series inductive elements along the radiating section is also examined. The inductive loads are constructed by two balanced short circuited slot lines placed on opposite sides of the radiating slot. These inductive loads can considerably reduce the antenna size at its resonance. Prototypes of a double resonant antenna at 850 MHz and inductively loaded miniaturized antennas at around 1 GHz are designed and tested.

Although the SVM has been shown to exhibit excellent generalization properties in many experiments, it suffers from several drawbacks, both of a theoretical and a technical nature: the absence of probabilistic outputs, the restriction to Mercer kernels, and the steep growth of the number of support vectors with increasing size of the training set. In this paper, we present a different class of kernel regressors that effectively overcome the above problems. We call this approach generalized LASSO regression. It has a clear probabilistic interpretation, can handle learning sets that are corrupted by outliers, produces extremely sparse solutions, and is capable of dealing with large-scale problems. For regression functionals which can be modeled as iteratively reweighted least-squares (IRLS) problems, we present a highly efficient algorithm with guaranteed global convergence. This defies a unique framework for sparse regression models in the very rich class of IRLS models, including various types of robust regression models and logistic regression. Performance studies for many standard benchmark datasets effectively demonstrate the advantages of this model over related approaches.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2003.809398","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1263575","","Support vector machines;Kernel;Robustness;Regression analysis;Additive noise;Large-scale systems;Iterative algorithms;Logistics;Machine learning","support vector machines;regression analysis;probability;least squares approximations;functional equations","generalized LASSO regression;probabilistic interpretation;learning sets;regression functionals;iteratively reweighted least-squares problems;guaranteed global convergence;robust loss functions;support vector machine method;kernel regression techniques;Mercer kernels;training set","Algorithms;Bayes Theorem;Models, Theoretical","118","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The motivation for this study is twofold, limiting multiuser interference to increase single-hop throughput and reducing power consumption to prolong battery life. We focus on next neighbor transmissions where nodes are required to send information packets to their respective receivers subject to a constraint on the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio. The multiple access problem is solved via two alternating phases, namely scheduling and power control. The scheduling algorithm is essential to coordinate the transmissions of independent users in order to eliminate strong levels of interference (e.g., self-interference) that cannot be overcome by power control. On the other hand, power control is executed in a distributed fashion to determine the admissible power vector, if one exists, that can be used by the scheduled users to satisfy their single-hop transmission requirements. This is done for two types of networks, namely time-division multiple-access (TDMA) and TDMA/code-division multiple-access wireless ad hoc networks.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2003.819032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259401","","Power control;Mobile ad hoc networks;Time division multiple access;Cross layer design;Throughput;Energy consumption;Batteries;Interference constraints;Scheduling algorithm;Interference elimination","power control;ad hoc networks;radiofrequency interference;scheduling;code division multiple access;time division multiple access;telecommunication control;mobile radio;radio receivers;protocols","scheduling;power control;wireless ad hoc networks;multiuser interference;single-hop throughput;signal to interference and noise ratio;multiple access problem;TDMA networks;time division multiple access;CDMA networks;code division multiple access networks","","338","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The optimal performance of the network can only be achieved by simultaneous optimization of routing and resource allocation. In this paper, we formulate the simultaneous routing and resource allocation (SRRA) problem, and exploit problem structure to derive efficient solution methods. We use a capacitated multicommodity flow model to describe the data flows in the network. We assume that the capacity of a wireless link is a concave and increasing function of the communications resources allocated to the link, and the communications resources for groups of links are limited. These assumptions allow us to formulate the SRRA problem as a convex optimization problem over the network flow variables and the communications variables. These two sets of variables are coupled only through the link capacity constraints. We exploit this separable structure by dual decomposition. The resulting solution method attains the optimal coordination of data routing in the network layer and resource allocation in the radio control layer via pricing on the link capacities.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2004.831346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1315914","","Routing;Resource management;Radio control;Bandwidth;Optimization methods;Communication system control;Pricing;Communications Society;Contracts;Military computing","telecommunication network routing;resource allocation;radio networks;radio links;channel capacity;pricing;optimisation","simultaneous routing;resource allocation;dual decomposition;wireless data networks;convex optimization;multicommodity flow model;radio link capacity;channel capacity","","379","","53","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Trained users can move the cursor in one or two dimensions. The primary goal of this research is to provide a new communication and control option for people with severe motor disabilities. Currently, cursor movements in each dimension are determined 10 times/s by an empirically derived linear function of one or two EEG features (i.e., spectral bands from different electrode locations). This study used offline analysis of data collected during system operation to explore methods for improving the accuracy of cursor movement. The data were gathered while users selected among three possible targets by controlling vertical [i.e., one-dimensional (1-D)] cursor movement. The three methods analyzed differ in the dimensionality of the cursor movement [1-D versus two-dimensional (2-D)] and in the type of the underlying function (linear versus nonlinear). We addressed two questions: Which method is best for classification (i.e., to determine from the EEG which target the user wants to hit)? How does the number of EEG features affect the performance of each method? All methods reached their optimal performance with 10-20 features. In offline simulation, the 2-D linear method and the 1-D nonlinear method improved performance significantly over the 1-D linear method. The 1-D linear method did not do so. These offline results suggest that the 1-D nonlinear or the 2-D linear cursor function will improve online operation of the BCI system.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2004.834627","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1333048","","Electroencephalography;Communication system control;Data analysis;Biomedical imaging;Frequency domain analysis;Scalp;Brain computer interfaces;Frequency conversion;Electrodes;Two dimensional displays","electroencephalography;handicapped aids;user interfaces;medical signal processing;biomedical electrodes","EEG activity;cursor movement control;brain-computer interface;Wadsworth electroencephalogram;sensorimotor cortex;severe motor disabilities;spectral bands;electrode locations;one-dimensional cursor movement;two-dimensional cursor movement;linear method;nonlinear method","Adult;Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Brain;Cerebral Palsy;Cerebral Palsy;Communication Aids for Disabled;Computer Peripherals;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Online Systems;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Task Performance and Analysis;Therapy, Computer-Assisted;User-Computer Interface;Word Processing","169","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Proceedings of the","","2004","","","9 pp.","","The paper presents the data warehousing architecture and practices used at a major U. S. retailing company. Many considerations were assessed when deciding which data warehousing architecture to adopt. The paper discusses the two pre-dominant styles in data warehousing, namely the ""Bill Inmon Style"" or the top-down approach and the ""Ralph Kimball Style ""or the bottom-up approach. The company chose the Inmon style due to a unique combination of circumstances in their business and technical environments, which are being discussed in detail. Much of the information presented in this paper is based upon the direct experiences of the lead data architect assigned to the projects under which this U. S. retailing company's customer data warehouse evolved. The architecture has evolved over time and currently has been accepted at the company as a best practice. It is interesting to mention that both the hardware platform (CPU and disk drives) and relational database management system (RDBMS) software employed today at this company for data warehousing is not the same as was selected for the first instantiation. The implication was that the best plan or practice was a flexible one. There were many challenges, like organizational, technical, data sourcing and data naming, needed to be solved during the pre-project, initial stages, and throughout the project and beyond. The initial data warehouse, implemented in 1996, was termed an overall success and approved for expansion. The current data warehouse data are being used by over six hundred registered users to fine-tune customer marketing and leverage and share data in an enterprise manner. The data warehouse has allowed the company to strengthen customer relationship management (CRM) core capabilities and business partnerships. Today, there are many departments benefiting from queries and requests for data warehouse data, many anticipated, some not. Although not planned, the data warehouse has been a valuable source of purchase and customer data in case of a manufacturer recall of merchandise. Above all, the company has been able to leverage and share enterprise customer data to the benefit of the entire company.","","0-7695-2056-1","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265515","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265515","","Best practices;Warehousing;Companies;Data warehouses;Computer architecture;Hardware;Disk drives;Relational databases;Software systems;Customer relationship management","data warehouses;competitive intelligence;business data processing","data warehousing architecture;Bill Inmon Style;top-down approach;Ralph Kimball Style;bottom-up approach;customer data warehouse;relational database management system software;data sourcing;data naming;customer marketing;customer relationship management;business intelligence","","5","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The incremental inductance of each active phase is estimated using the terminal measurement of this phase. The estimated phase incremental inductance is compared to an analytical model, which represents the functional relationships between the phase incremental inductance, phase current, and rotor position, to estimate the rotor position. The presented sensorless control scheme requires neither extra hardware nor huge memory space for implementation.

This converter adopts one-cycle control for fast line response and dual error correction loops for tight load regulation. A dc level shifting technique is proposed to eliminate the use of negative supply and reference voltages in the controller and make the design compatible with standard digital CMOS process. The design accommodates both continuous and discontinuous conduction operations. To further enhance the efficiency, dynamic loss control on the power transistors is proposed to minimize the sum of switching and conduction losses. The design can be extended to other dc-dc and ac-dc conversions. The prototype of the buck converter was fabricated with a standard 0.5-/spl mu/m digital CMOS process. Experimental results show that the converter is well regulated over an output range of 0.9-2.5 V, with a supply voltage of 3.3 V. The tracking speeds are 12.25 /spl mu/s/V for a 1.6-V step-up output change and 13.75 /spl mu/s/V for a 1.6-V step-down output change, respectively, which are much faster than existing counterparts.

The steady-state regulation of the oxygen excess ratio in the FCS cathode achieved by assigning an integrator to the compressor flow. Linear observability techniques were employed to demonstrate improvements in transient oxygen regulation when the FCS voltage is included as a measurement for the feedback controller. The FCS voltage signal contains high frequency information about the FC oxygen utilization, and thus, is a natural and valuable output for feedback. We used linear optimal control design to identify the frequencies at which there is a severe tradeoff between the transient system net power performance and the stack starvation control. The limitation arises when the FCS system architecture dictates that all auxiliary equipment is powered directly from the FC with no secondary power sources. This plant configuration is preferred due to its simplicity, compactness, and low cost. The FCS impedance given the closed-loop air flow and perfect humidification and temperature regulation captures the FC current-voltage dynamic relationship. It is expected that the closed-loop FCS impedance will provide the basis for the systematic design of FC stack electronic components.","1941-000X","","10.1109/MCS.2004.1275430","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1275430","","Fuel cells;Frequency;Optimal control;Impedance;Protection;Steady-state;Cathodes;Observability;Adaptive control;Voltage","proton exchange membrane fuel cells;oxygen;optimal control;state feedback;closed loop systems;observability;control system synthesis;flow control;electrodes","air flow controllers;FC stack;fuel cell stack;fuel cell breathing control;oxygen starvation;proton exchange membrane FC;PEMFC;feedback controller;linear quadratic technique;closed loop FC system;observer-based feedback control;steady-state regulation;linear observability technique;FCS voltage signal;linear optimal control","","265","","41","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Because of the nonlinearity introduced by the dead time, turn-on/off delay, snubber circuit and voltage drop across power devices, the output voltage of VSI inverters is distorted seriously in the low output voltage region. This distortion influences the output torque of IM motors for constant V/f drives. The nonlinearity of the inverter also causes 5th and 7th harmonic distortion in the line current when the distributed energy system operates in the grid-connected mode, i.e., when the distributed energy system is parallel to a large power system through the VSI inverter. Therefore, the exact compensation of this nonlinearity in the VSI inverter over the entire range of output voltage is desirable. In this paper, the nonlinearity of VSI inverter output voltage and the harmonic distortion in the line current are analyzed based on an open-loop system and a L-R load. By minimizing the harmonic component of the current in a d-axis and q-axis synchronous rotating reference frame, the exact compensation factor was obtained. Simulations and experimental results in the low frequency and low output voltage region are presented.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2004.830072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1310390","","Inverters;Low voltage;Harmonic distortion;Power system harmonics;Delay effects;Snubbers;Circuits;Torque;Synchronous motors;Drives","harmonic distortion;invertors;open loop systems;compensation","nonlinearity compensation technique;voltage source inverters;output voltage;harmonic distortion;distributed energy system;open-loop system;line current;compensation factor","","89","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The key feature of the proposed architecture is the low complexity: only two digital-to-analog converters (DACs) with low resolution (7-b) are used for control. An original control algorithm is used to reduce quantization effects to negligible levels, in spite of the low resolution of the DACs. Thanks to this algorithm, both static and dynamic output voltage regulation are improved with respect to traditional digital solutions. Adaptive voltage positioning and active current sharing are inherently provided by the new architecture. A detailed description of the control strategy is given with reference to a single-phase buck converter. Extension to multiphase converters is straightforward. The digital control architecture is experimentally verified on a FPGA-based four-phase prototype buck converter operating at 350 kHz/phase. Output voltage tolerance within /spl plusmn/0.5% is experimentally demonstrated, along with negligible quantization effects and fast transient response. The features and the performance of the proposed architecture make it a valuable candidate for the control of next generation voltage regulator modules.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2003.820543","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1262070","","Digital control;DC-DC power converters;Voltage control;Quantization;Buck converters;Digital-to-frequency converters;Frequency conversion;Digital-analog conversion;Prototypes;Transient response","digital control;DC-DC power convertors;switching convertors;voltage control;electric current control;digital-analogue conversion;field programmable gate arrays","digital control architecture;voltage regulation;digital-to-analog converters;quantization effects;adaptive voltage positioning;active current sharing;control strategy;single-phase buck converters;DC-DC switching power converters;current-programmed control","","141","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Center, Georgia Inst. of Technol., Atlanta, GA, USA","IEEE Transactions on Advanced Packaging","","2004","27","2","241","249","In the past, microsystems packaging played two roles: 1) it provided I/O connections to and from integrated circuits (ICs) or wafer-level packaging (WLP), and 2) it interconnected both active and passive components on system level boards, referred to as systems packaging. Both were accomplished by interconnections or multilayer wiring at the package or board level. More recently, the IC devices have begun to integrate not only more and more transistors, but also active and passive components on an individual chip, leading the community to believe that someday there may be a single-chip complete system, referred to as system-on-chip (SOC). This can be called horizontal or two-dimensional (2-D) integration of IC blocks in a single-chip toward end-product systems. The community began to realize, however, that such an approach presents fundamental, engineering, and investment limits, as well as computing and communication limits for wireless and wired systems over the long run. This led to 3-D packaging approaches, often referred to as system-in-package (SIP). The SIP, while providing major opportunities in both miniaturization and integration for advanced and portable electronic products, is a subsystem, limited by the CMOS process just like the SOC. Some existing and emerging applications, however, include sensors, memory modules and embedded processors with DRAMs. More recent 3-D solutions, which incorporate stacked package approaches, offer solutions toward faster time-to-market and business impediments that have plagued MCM deployment for the past decade. There is a new emerging concept called system-on-package (SOP). With SOP, the package, not the board, is the system. As such, SOP is beginning to address the shortcomings of both SOC and SIP, as well as traditional packaging which is bulky, costly, and lower in performance and reliability than ICs, in two ways: 1) It uses CMOS-based silicon for what it is good for, namely, for transistor integration, and the package, for what it is good for, namely, RF, optical, and digital integration by means of IC-package-system codesign. The SOP package, therefore, overcomes both the computing limitations and integration limitations of SOC, SIP, MCM, and traditional system packaging. It does this by having global wiring as well as RF, digital, and optical component integration in the package, not in the chip. The SOP, therefore, includes both active and passive components in thin-film form, in contrast with indiscrete or thick-film form, including embedded digital, RF, and optical components, and functions in a microminiaturized package or board.","1557-9980","","10.1109/TADVP.2004.830354","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1331506","","Wafer scale integration;Integrated circuit packaging;Radio frequency;Integrated circuit interconnections;Electronics packaging;Optical devices;Integrated circuit technology;Nonhomogeneous media;Wiring;System-on-a-chip","system-on-chip;integrated circuit packaging;integrated circuit interconnections;multichip modules;integrated optoelectronics","microsystem-integration;Moore law;microsystems packaging;wafer-level packaging;systems packaging;3D packaging;system-in-package;embedded processors;DRAM;transistor integration;IC-package-system codesign;consumer electronics;integrated optoelectronics;multichip modules;active components;passive components;convergent electronics systems;integrated circuit packaging;integrated circuit interconnections;system-on-chip;system-on-package","","178","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Stabilization and path following of a single wheel robot","Yangsheng Xu; S. K. -.

This is a novel concept for a mobile robot that provides dynamic stability for rapid locomotion. The robot is a sharp-edged wheel actuated by a spinning flywheel for steering and a drive motor for propulsion. The spinning flywheel acts as a gyroscope to stabilize the robot and it can be steered by tilting. This robot is nonholonomic in nature, underactuated and inherently unstable in the lateral direction. In this paper, we first develop a three-dimensional (3-D) nonlinear dynamic model and investigate the dynamic characteristics of the robot. We conduct simulations and real-time experiments to verify the model. Both simulations and experiments show that the flywheel has a significant stabilizing effect on the robot. Then, we can decouple the longitudinal and lateral motions of the robot by linearization. We propose a linear state feedback to stabilize the robot at different lean angles, so as to control the steering velocity of the robot indirectly, because the robot steers only by leaning itself to a predefined angle. For the task of path following, we design a controller for tracking any desired straight line without falling. In the controller, we first design the linear and steering velocities for driving the robot along the desired straight line by controlling the path curvature. We then apply the linear state feedback to stabilize the robot at the predefined lean angle such that the resulting steering velocity of the robot converges to the given steering velocity. This work is a significant step toward fully autonomous control of such a dynamically stable but statically unstable system.","1941-014X","","10.1109/TMECH.2004.828642","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1306455","","Wheels;Mobile robots;Flywheels;Velocity control;Spinning;State feedback;Stability;Propulsion;Gyroscopes;Linear feedback control systems","stability;nonlinear dynamical systems;motion control;velocity control;control system synthesis;state feedback;nonlinear control systems;flywheels;mobile robots","single wheel robot;gyroscopically stabilized robot;mobile robot;dynamic stability;rapid locomotion;spinning flywheel;3D nonlinear dynamic models;state feedback stabilization;controller design;path following;steering velocity;autonomous control;nonholonomic systems","","70","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nevertheless, there are two hurdles that impede the further progress of the research on the output regulation problem. The first one is the assumption that the solution or the partial solution of the regulator equations is polynomial. The second one is the lack of a systematic mechanism to handle the global robust output regulation problem. We establish a general framework that systematically converts the robust output regulation problem for a general nonlinear system into a robust stabilization problem for an appropriately augmented system. This general framework, on one hand, relaxes the polynomial assumption, and on the other hand, offers a greater flexibility to incorporate recent new stabilization techniques, thus setting a stage for systematically tackling the robust output regulation with global stability.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2004.839236","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1369396","Internal model principle;nonlinear systems;output regulation;robust control","Robustness;Nonlinear systems;Regulators;Nonlinear equations;Polynomials;Robust control;Automation;Asymptotic stability;Robust stability;Linear systems","nonlinear control systems;closed loop systems;robust control","nonlinear output regulation problem;closed-loop stability;asymptotic tracking;disturbance rejection;nonlinear control;robust stabilization problem","","334","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Eng., Alberta Univ., Edmonton, Alta., Canada; NA","IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","","2004","16","2","145","153","The task of extracting knowledge from databases is quite often performed by machine learning algorithms. The majority of these algorithms can be applied only to data described by discrete numerical or nominal attributes (features). In the case of continuous attributes, there is a need for a discretization algorithm that transforms continuous attributes into discrete ones. We describe such an algorithm, called CAIM (class-attribute interdependence maximization), which is designed to work with supervised data. The goal of the CAIM algorithm is to maximize the class-attribute interdependence and to generate a (possibly) minimal number of discrete intervals. The algorithm does not require the user to predefine the number of intervals, as opposed to some other discretization algorithms. The tests performed using CAIM and six other state-of-the-art discretization algorithms show that discrete attributes generated by the CAIM algorithm almost always have the lowest number of intervals and the highest class-attribute interdependency. Two machine learning algorithms, the CLIP4 rule algorithm and the decision tree algorithm, are used to generate classification rules from data discretized by CAIM. For both the CLIP4 and decision tree algorithms, the accuracy of the generated rules is higher and the number of the rules is lower for data discretized using the CAIM algorithm when compared to data discretized using six other discretization algorithms. The highest classification accuracy was achieved for data sets discretized with the CAIM algorithm, as compared with the other six algorithms.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2004.1269594","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269594","","Machine learning algorithms;Decision trees;Data mining;Discrete transforms;Algorithm design and analysis;Spatial databases;Testing;Performance evaluation;Classification tree analysis;Internet","learning (artificial intelligence);data mining;decision trees;very large databases;optimisation","discretization algorithm;machine learning algorithm;class-attribute interdependence maximization;supervised data discretization;CLIP4 rule algorithm;decision tree algorithm;classification rules","","248","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The second-iteration Moore rat-race coupler occupies only 12.6% of the conventional coupler's area, while the area of the second-iteration Sierpinski branch-line coupler is 24.7% of the conventional case.

All retinal vessels originate from the OD and their path follows a similar directional pattern (parabolic course) in all images. To describe the general direction of retinal vessels at any given position in the image, a geometrical parametric model was proposed, where two of the model parameters are the coordinates of the OD center. Using as experimental data samples of vessel centerline points and corresponding vessel directions, provided by any vessel identification procedure, model parameters were identified by means of a simulated annealing optimization technique. These estimated values provide the coordinates of the center of OD. A Matlab/spl reg/ prototype implementing this method was developed. An evaluation of the proposed procedure was performed using the set of 81 images from the STARE project, containing images from both normal and pathological subjects.

The pursuit framework is particularly simple in that the n identical vehicles are ordered such that vehicle i pursues vehicle i+1 modulo n. In this paper, we assume each vehicle has the same constant forward speed. We show that the system's equilibrium formations are generalized regular polygons and it is exposed how the multivehicle system's global behavior can be shaped through appropriate controller gain assignments.

Both dc homopolar and ac synchronous machines were successfully tested from the 1970s to the 1990s. Three different 70-MW generators were recently demonstrated by the SuperGM project in Japan. However, economic considerations with respect to competitive cost combined with the requirement for liquid helium cooling did not make these machines commercially attractive. On the other hand, high-temperature superconductors (HTSs) can operate at much higher temperatures (30-40 K), providing much larger thermal margin and simpler cooling systems. This refrigeration advantage has provided new impetus to the development of such machines for commercial applications. In the last few years, a number of superconducting rotating machines with HTS field windings have been demonstrated and several projects are currently transitioning to advanced development stages. HTS machines with ratings from a few kilowatts to several megawatts have been demonstrated in the United States and Europe. Currently, large high-torque ship propulsion motors, large generator prototypes, and synchronous condensers are under development and are expected to be commercially available in the next few years. Prospects for improved life cycle cost, smaller size, less weight, and higher efficiency benefits are providing incentives for the development of these larger rating HTS machines.

In particular, in the context of lookup table, cluster-based island-style FPGAs (Betz et al. 1997) we look at the effect of lookup table (LUT) size and cluster size (number of LUTs per cluster) on the speed and logic density of an FPGA. We use a fully timing-driven experimental flow (Betz et al. 1997), (Marquardt, 1999) in which a set of benchmark circuits are synthesized into different cluster-based (Betz and Rose, 1997, 1998) and (Marquardt, 1999) logic block architectures, which contain groups of LUTs and flip-flops. Across all architectures with LUT sizes in the range of 2 to 7 inputs, and cluster size from 1 to 10 LUTs, we have experimentally determined the relationship between the number of inputs required for a cluster as a function of the LUT size (K) and cluster size (N). Second, contrary to previous results, we have shown that clustering small LUTs (sizes 2 and 3) produces better area results than what was presented in the past. However, our results also show that the performance of FPGAs with these small LUT sizes is significantly worse (by almost a factor of 2) than larger LUTs. Hence, as measured by area-delay product, or by performance, these would be a bad choice. Also, we have discovered that LUT sizes of 5 and 6 produce much better area results than were previously believed. Finally, our results show that a LUT size of 4 to 6 and cluster size of between 3-10 provides the best area-delay product for an FPGA.","1557-9999","","10.1109/TVLSI.2004.824300","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1281800","","Table lookup;Field programmable gate arrays;Design automation;Delay;Logic circuits;Very large scale integration;Circuit synthesis;Flip-flops;Area measurement;Logic design","table lookup;field programmable gate arrays;VLSI;logic CAD;flip-flops;reconfigurable architectures;integrated logic circuits","lookup table size effect;cluster size effect;deep submicron FPGA performance;field programmable gate array;FPGA density;cluster based island style FPGA;benchmark circuits;logic block architectures;flip-flops;area delay product;CAD;computer aided design;VLSI;very large scale integrated circuits","","201","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most recent works on time series only address how to identify a given pattern from a time series and do not consider the problem of identifying a suitable set of time points for segmenting the time series in accordance with a given set of pattern templates (e.g., a set of technical patterns for stock analysis). However, the use of fixed-length segmentation is an oversimplified approach to this problem; hence, a dynamic approach (with high controllability) is preferable so that the time series can be segmented flexibly and effectively according to the needs of the users and the applications. In view of the fact that this segmentation problem is an optimization problem and evolutionary computation is an appropriate tool to solve it, we propose an evolutionary time series segmentation algorithm. This approach allows a sizeable set of pattern templates to be generated for mining or query. In addition, defining similarity between time series (or time series segments) is of fundamental importance in fitness computation. By identifying the perceptually important points directly from the time domain, time series segments and templates of different lengths can be compared and intuitive pattern matching can be carried out in an effective and efficient manner. Encouraging experimental results are reported from tests that segment both artificial time series generated from the combinations of pattern templates and the time series of selected Hong Kong stocks.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2004.832863","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1347161","","Evolutionary computation;Data mining;Transaction databases;Pattern analysis;Time series analysis;Controllability;Pattern matching;Testing;Test pattern generators;Research and development","time series;pattern matching;evolutionary computation;data mining","time series data;pattern templates;fixed length segmentation;evolutionary computation;pattern matching;data mining","","85","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two different image features have been considered: the width of the outer contour of the binarized silhouette of the walking person and the entire binary silhouette itself. To obtain the observation vector from the image features, we employ two different methods. In the first method, referred to as the indirect approach, the high-dimensional image feature is transformed to a lower dimensional space by generating what we call the frame to exemplar (FED) distance. The FED vector captures both structural and dynamic traits of each individual. For compact and effective gait representation and recognition, the gait information in the FED vector sequences is captured in a hidden Markov model (HMM). In the second method, referred to as the direct approach, we work with the feature vector directly (as opposed to computing the FED) and train an HMM. We estimate the HMM parameters (specifically the observation probability B) based on the distance between the exemplars and the image features. In this way, we avoid learning high-dimensional probability density functions. The statistical nature of the HMM lends overall robustness to representation and recognition. The performance of the methods is illustrated using several databases.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2004.832865","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1323098","","Humans;Hidden Markov models;Legged locomotion;Computer science;Feature extraction;Parameter estimation;Probability density function;Robustness;Image databases;Spatial databases","image recognition;hidden Markov models;probability;visual databases;image representation;image sequences","human identification;gait recognition;image features;observation vector;frame to exemplar distance;hidden Markov model;observation probability;binary silhouette;gait databases","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Gait;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique;Task Performance and Analysis;Video Recording","380","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A short length of wire formed the antenna while a beam lead Schottky diode across a resonant loop formed the frequency doubler circuit yielding a total tag mass of less than 3 mg. Simulators using the method-of-moments for the antenna, finite-integral time-domain for the loop, and harmonic balance for the nonlinear diode element were used to predict and optimize the transceiver performance. This performance is compared to the ideal case and to measurements performed using a pulsed magnetron source within an anechoic chamber. A method for analysis of the tag is presented and used to optimize the design by creating the largest possible return signal at the second harmonic frequency for a particular incident power density. These methods were verified through measurement of tags both in isolation and mounted on insects. For excitation at 9.41 GHz the optimum tag in isolation had an antenna length of 12 mm with a loop diameter of 1 mm which yielded a harmonic cross-section of 40 mm/sup 2/. For tags mounted on Colorado potato beetles, optimum performance was achieved with an 8 mm dipole fed 2 mm from the beetle attached end. A theory is developed that describes harmonic radar in a fashion similar to the conventional radar range equation but with harmonic cross-section replacing the conventional radar cross-section. This method provides a straightforward description of harmonic radar system performance as well as provides a means to describe harmonic radar tag performance.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2004.835166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1353476","Antenna measurements;dipole antennas;radar applications;radar theory;radio tracking;transceivers;Schottky diodes","Radar tracking;Transceivers;Insects;Radar cross section;Antenna measurements;Radar antennas;Schottky diodes;Pulse measurements;Radar theory;Radar measurements","radar equipment;radar antennas;remote sensing by radar;zoology;transceivers;wire antennas;Schottky diodes;frequency multipliers;method of moments;time-domain analysis;dipole antennas","harmonic radar transceiver design;miniature tags;insect tracking;wire antenna;beam lead Schottky diode;resonant loop;frequency doubler circuit;method-of-moments;finite-integral time-domain;harmonic balance;nonlinear diode element;harmonic cross-section;antenna measurements;dipole antennas;9.41 GHz","","113","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, increased power densities (hence temperatures) and other scaling effects have an adverse impact on long-term processor lifetime reliability. This paper represents a first attempt at quantifying the impact of scaling on lifetime reliability due to intrinsic hard errors, taking workload characteristics into consideration. For our quantitative evaluation, we use RAMP (Srinivasan et al., 2004), a previously proposed industrial-strength model that provides reliability estimates for a workload, but for a given technology. We extend RAMP by adding scaling specific parameters to enable workload-dependent lifetime reliability evaluation at different technologies. We show that (1) scaling has a significant impact on processor hard failure rates - on average, with SPEC benchmarks, we find the failure rate of a scaled 65nm processor to be 316% higher than a similarly pipelined 180nm processor; (2) time-dependent dielectric breakdown and electromigration have the largest increases; and (3) with scaling, the difference in reliability from running at worst-case vs. typical workload operating conditions increases significantly, as does the difference from running different workloads. Our results imply that leveraging a single microarchitecture design for multiple remaps across a few technology generations will become increasingly difficult, and motivate a need for workload specific, microarchitectural lifetime reliability awareness at an early design stage.","","0-7695-2052-9","10.1109/DSN.2004.1311888","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1311888","","CMOS technology;Dynamic voltage scaling;Threshold voltage;CMOS process;Dielectric breakdown;Electromigration;Microarchitecture;Thermal stresses;Rivers;Computer science","CMOS integrated circuits;microprocessor chips;integrated circuit reliability;benchmark testing","technology scaling;CMOS technology;RAMP;reliability estimation;time-dependent dielectric breakdown;electromigration;microarchitectural lifetime reliability;processor performance;processor lifetime reliability;industrial-strength model","","305","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When processing SAR images, there is a strong need for statistical models of scattering to take into account multiplicative noise and high dynamics. For instance, the classification process needs to be based on the use of statistics. Our main contribution is the choice of an accurate model for high-resolution SAR images over urban areas and its use in a Markovian classification algorithm. Clutter in SAR images becomes non-Gaussian when the resolution is high or when the area is man-made. Many models have been proposed to fit with non-Gaussian scattering statistics (K, Weibull, Log-normal, Nakagami-Rice, etc.), but none of them is flexible enough to model all kinds of surfaces in our context. As a consequence, we use a mathematical model that relies on the Fisher distribution and the log-moment estimation and which is relevant for one-look data. This estimation method is based on the second-kind statistics, which are detailed in the paper. We also prove its accuracy for urban areas at high resolution. The quality of the classification that is obtained by mixing this model and a Markovian segmentation is high and enables us to distinguish between ground, buildings, and vegetation.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.834630","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1344157","","Urban areas;Radar scattering;Context modeling;Statistical distributions;Synthetic aperture radar;Statistics;Classification algorithms;Clutter;Image resolution;Surface fitting","Markov processes;image classification;image segmentation;terrain mapping;vegetation mapping;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;radar resolution;radar imaging;radar clutter;statistical distributions;image resolution;geophysical signal processing","statistical model;urban areas;high-resolution SAR images;image classification;synthetic aperture radar;SAR image processing;scattering models;multiplicative noise;Markovian classification algorithm;SAR image clutter;nonGaussian scattering statistics;K statistics;Weibull statistics;log-normal statistics;Nakagami-Rice statistics;mathematical model;Fisher distribution;log-moment estimation;second-kind statistics;Markovian segmentation;Mellin transform","","260","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, its back electromotive force (EMF) at the peak revolutions per minute should be less than its battery voltage for the power flow control. For example, the back-EMF of a 12-pole ISA should be 42 V at 6000 r/min. These types of conflicting requirements lead to a nonclassical motor design that has extremely large field-weakening range (8:1/spl sim/10:1). In this paper, we are considering the use of an induction machine instead of a permanent synchronous machine. As an idea for solving the voltage limit problem, two inverters are utilized with an objective of sharing the required voltage. The secondary inverter only takes care of the reactive voltage component that grows very fast in high-speed operation. Therefore, an extra voltage source is not required for the secondary inverter. Only a capacitor bank suffices for the secondary inverter.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2004.825232","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1282019","","Induction motors;Voltage;Inverters;Instruction sets;Alternators;Torque;Batteries;Load flow control;Synchronous motors;Induction machines","invertors;induction motors;hybrid electric vehicles;electric potential;load flow control","dual-inverter control strategy;EV induction motors;integrated starter;integrated alternator;back electromotive force;EMF;battery voltage;power flow control;reactive voltage component;capacitor bank;field-weakening operation;hybrid electric vehicle;HEV;redundancy provision;42 V","","122","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In such an absorber, high magnetic losses over a wide frequency range induce a series of strong and wide absorption peaks at increasing frequencies. By using metallic (iron and cobalt) nanoparticles, absorbers with relatively low volume fraction of metallic inclusions can be made. The paper compares the characteristics of nanocomposite absorbers to those of common dielectric or ferromagnetic absorbers and identifies the potential advantages of nanocomposite absorbers.

This is obtained by introducing changes in the pheromone value update rule. These changes can in general be applied to any pheromone value update rule used in ant colony optimization. We discuss the benefits coming with this new framework. The benefits are twofold. On the theoretical side, the new framework allows us to prove that in the ant system, the ancestor of all ant colony optimization algorithms, the average quality of the solutions produced increases in expectation over time when applied to unconstrained problems. On the practical side, the new framework automatically handles the scaling of the objective function values.

The novel filtering ADC is realized by adding a high-pass feedback path to a conventional /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ ADC while a compensating low-pass filter in the forward path maintains stability. As such, the ADC becomes highly immune to interferers even if they exceed the maximum allowable input level for the wanted channel. As a consequence, the ADC input range can be programmed dynamically to the level of the wanted signal only. This results in an input-referred dynamic range of 89 dB in 1-MHz bandwidth and an intentionally moderate output signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio of 46-59 dB (depending on the programmed gain).

The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can provide better performance than the original IHS method, both in processing speed and image quality.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2004.834804","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1347129","","Spatial resolution;Image fusion;Wavelet transforms;Merging;Principal component analysis;Filtering;Image quality;Infrared imaging;Automobiles;Roads","vegetation mapping;remote sensing by radar;geophysical signal processing","intensity-hue-saturation fusion methods;spectral adjustment;IKONOS imagery;image fusion methods;intensity-hue-saturation methods;massive data volumes;spectral distortion;fused multispectral bands;IHS fusion method;image quality;processing speed;spatial enhancement;green vegetated region","","337","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Ambient intelligence: a multimedia perspective","E. Aarts","Philips Res., Eindhoven, Netherlands","IEEE MultiMedia","","2004","11","1","12","19","Ambient intelligence opens up a world of unprecedented experiences. The interaction of people with electronic devices will change as context awareness, natural interfaces, and ubiquitous availability of information come to fruition. Ambient intelligence is going to impose major challenges on multimedia research. Distributed multimedia applications and their processing on embedded static and mobile platforms will play a major role in the development of ambient-intelligent environments. The requirements that ambient-intelligent multimedia applications impose on the mechanisms users apply to interact with media call for paradigms substantially different from contemporary interaction concepts. The complexity of media will continually increase in terms of volume and functionality, thus introducing a need for simplicity and ease of use. Therefore, the massively distributed, integrated use of media will require replacing well-known interaction vehicles, such as remote control and menu-driven search and control, with novel more intuitive, and natural concepts. This article reviews the concept of ambient intelligence and elaborates on its relation with multimedia. (The ""Advances in media processing"" sidebar gives insight into the developments that have set the stage for this new step forward.) The emphasis is on qualitative aspects, highlighting those elements that play a role in realizing ambient intelligence. Multimedia processing techniques and applications are key to realizing ambient intelligence, and they introduce major challenges to the design and implementation of both media-processing platforms and multimedia applications. Technology will not be the limiting factor in realizing ambient intelligence. The ingredients to let the computers disappear are already available, but the true success of the paradigm will depend on the ability to develop concepts that allow natural interaction with digital environments. We must build these digital environments with the invisible technology of the forthcoming century. The role of intelligent algorithms in this respect is apparent because it is the key enabling factor for realizing natural interaction.","1941-0166","","10.1109/MMUL.2004.1261101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1261101","","Ambient intelligence;Pervasive computing;Ubiquitous computing;Materials science and technology;Computer vision;Oxygen;Productivity;Displays;Context-aware services;Context","multimedia systems;ubiquitous computing;virtual reality;information technology;artificial intelligence","ambient intelligence;electronic devices;context awareness;natural interfaces;multimedia research;distributed multimedia;embedded static platform;mobile platforms;contemporary interaction;media complexity;interaction vehicles;remote control;menu-driven search;multimedia processing;media-processing;digital environments;intelligent algorithms;natural interaction","","127","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
"Direct position determination of narrowband radio frequency transmitters","A. J. Weiss","Tel Aviv Univ., Israel","IEEE Signal Processing Letters","","2004","11","5","513","516","The most common methods for location of communications or radar transmitters are based on measuring a specified parameter such as signal angle of arrival (AOA) or time of arrival (TOA). The measured parameters are then used to estimate the transmitter location. Since the AOA/TOA measurements are done at each base station separately, without using the constraint that all measurements must correspond to the same transmitter, they are suboptimal. We propose a technique that uses exactly the same data as the common methods, except that the estimation of location is based on exact maximum likelihood, and the location determination is direct. Although there are many stray parameters, including the attenuation coefficients and the signal waveform, the method requires only a two-dimensional search. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the accuracy is equivalent to AOA, TOA, and their combination for high SNR, while for low SNR, the accuracy of the proposed method is superior.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2004.826501","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1288121","","Narrowband;Radio frequency;Radio transmitters;Sensor arrays;Array signal processing;Base stations;Underwater acoustics;Maximum likelihood estimation;RF signals;Cost function","navigation;radio transmitters;optical transmitters;radar transmitters;direction-of-arrival estimation;Monte Carlo methods;maximum likelihood estimation","direct position determination;narrowband radio frequency transmitters;radar transmitters;signal angle of arrival;signal time of arrival;AOA;TOA;attenuation coefficients;signal waveform;two-dimensional search;Monte Carlo simulations;SNR;maximum likelihood","","181","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This allows us to find the constraints that any response function must satisfy. These constraints determine the theoretical space of all possible camera responses. We have collected a diverse database of real-world camera response functions (DoRF). Using this database, we show that real-world responses occupy a small part of the theoretical space of all possible responses. We combine the constraints from our theoretical space with the data from DoRF to create a low-parameter empirical model of response (EMoR). This response model allows us to accurately interpolate the complete response function of a camera from a small number of measurements obtained using a standard chart. We also show that the model can be used to accurately estimate the camera response from images of an arbitrary scene taken using different exposures.

By etching SRRs in the upper substrate side, in close proximity to conductor strip, strong magnetic coupling between line and rings arises at the resonant frequency of SRRs. This inhibits signal propagation in the vicinity of that frequency, allowing the rejection of undesired passbands by properly tuning SRRs. To test this novel technique, we have designed and fabricated two different SSRs-based filters. In one case, the rings have been designed to suppress only the first spurious band, and SRRs have been etched at both sides of the 50-/spl Omega/ access lines. For the other prototype, SRRs have been etched on the active device region (i.e., surrounding the parallel coupled lines) and have been tuned to eliminate the first and second undesired bands. The measured frequency responses for these devices confirm the efficiency of this technique to suppress frequency parasitics, with rejection levels near 40 dBs, leaving the passband unaltered. Since SRRs are small particles (with sub-wavelength dimensions at the resonant frequency), this approach does not add extra area to the final layouts. Moreover, the conventional design methodology of the filters holds.","1558-1764","","10.1109/LMWC.2004.832066","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1324733","","Passband;Microstrip filters;Microstrip resonators;Band pass filters;Optical ring resonators;Etching;Magnetic separation;Resonant frequency;Conductors;Strips","microstrip filters;band-pass filters;microwave filters;resonators;electromagnetic coupling;frequency response","spurious passband suppression;microstrip band pass filters;coupled line band pass filters;split ring resonators;substrate side;conductor strip;magnetic coupling;resonant frequency;signal propagation;SSR-based filters;active device region;parallel coupled lines;frequency parasitics suppression;metamaterials;microwave filters","","148","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper uses the lens of Max Weber’s theory of bureaucracy to examine contemporary EGovernment related research and literature. Two major, prevailing themes emerge from this exercise. The first theme that emerges is that IT (information technology) is a tool for `reforming′ bureaucracy. The second, somewhat contradictory, theme is that EGovernment failure may be explained as a consequence of bureaucracy. Each of these themes is discussed in detail. These themes are also explored via case studies. The paper concludes that current E-Government research does not offer adequate clarity on the issue of how E-Government and bureaucracy impact each other in reciprocal ways; and calls for future research into these issues.","","0-7695-2056-1","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265321","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265321","","Lenses;Electronic government;Information technology;Technological innovation;Collaboration;Computer networks;Communications technology;Logic;Decision making","","","","5","","78","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, the edge detection and localization performance of the ICOV-squared (ICOVS) detector are examined. First, a simplified version of the ICOVS detector, the normalized gradient magnitude squared, is scrutinized in order to reveal the statistical performance of edge detection and localization in speckled ultrasound imagery. Both the probability of detection and the probability of false alarm are evaluated for the detector. Edge localization is characterized by the position of the peak and the 3-dB width of the detector response. Then, the speckle-edge response of the ICOVS as applied to a realistic edge model is studied. Through theoretical analysis, we reveal the compensatory effects of the normalized Laplacian operator in the ICOV edge detector for edge-localization error. An ICOV-based edge-detection algorithm is implemented in which the ICOV detector is embedded in a diffusion coefficient in an anisotropic diffusion process. Experiments with real ultrasound images have shown that the proposed algorithm is effective in extracting edges in the presence of speckle. Quantitatively, the ICOVS provides a lower localization error, and qualitatively, a dramatic improvement in edge-detection performance over an existing edge-detection method for speckled imagery.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2004.836166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1355943","Edge detection;instantaneous coefficient of variation;speckle;ultrasonic image","Image edge detection;Ultrasonic imaging;Speckle;Laplace equations;Probability;Humans;Filters;Gamma ray detection;Gamma ray detectors;Anisotropic magnetoresistance","edge detection;gradient methods;statistical analysis;probability;speckle;Monte Carlo methods;biomedical ultrasonics;medical image processing","edge detection algorithm;ultrasound imagery;instantaneous coefficient of variation;Laplacian operators;normalized gradient operators;edge localization;image detection probability;speckle-edge response;image extraction;ultrasonic image;anisotropic diffusion process;Monte Carlo methods","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Phantoms, Imaging;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Ultrasonography;Ultrasonography","83","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In practice, the performance of the controlled system is limited by how to select the high-quality differential signal in the presence of disturbances and measurement noise. Moreover, unmodeled nonlinear friction provides degradation on the motion precision. So, a nonlinear tracking differentiator in the feedforward path and an extended states observer in the feedback path are designed to obtain high quality differential signal and the real action component of unknown disturbance signals including nonlinear friction without a precise mathematical model. The nonlinear PD (proportional derivative) controller is used to synthesize the control action to give a superior performance. Extensive simulations and experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness and ease of engineering implementation of the proposed method. The developed ADRC controller is simple and directly intuitive to the practitioners.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2004.824315","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1291407","","Motion control;PD control;Friction;Proportional control;Robust control;Control systems;Noise measurement;Degradation;State feedback;Signal design","manipulator kinematics;tracking;motion control;control system synthesis;nonlinear control systems;friction;feedforward;observers;feedback;PD control;discrete time systems;position control","autodisturbance rejection controller;high-precision motion control;Stewart platform;tracking control;differential signal;nonlinear friction;nonlinear tracking differentiator;feedforward path;extended states observer;feedback path;nonlinear PD controller;proportional derivative controller;manipulator kinematics;discrete-time system","","148","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A user profile and a general profile are learned from the user's search history and a category hierarchy, respectively. These two profiles are combined to map a user query into a set of categories which represent the user's search intention and serve as a context to disambiguate the words in the user's query.

The multi-band antennas with one feeding port use multiple resonance technology (R. Kronberger et al., AP confer., pp. 2714-2717, 1999). It can be difficult for such antennas to provide good polarization efficiency for GPS signal reception. So the integrated GPS/K-PCS dual-band antenna using two feeding ports has been proposed in this paper. A referenced dual-band antenna using two feeding port has matched polarization of integrated system, but it has large size. The proposed antenna uses a miniaturization technique of inserting slits. This technique increases electrical surface length by the slits (S. Reed et al., Microwave Opt. Technol. Lett., vol 29, 2001; J.Y. Wu and K.L. Wong, Electronics Lett., vol. 34, 1998; W.S.

A meander line patch and square ring patch with four slits of proposed antenna are about 70% and 50% of referenced antenna size. The proposed antenna is composed of a low-profile cylindrical monopole with a top-loaded meander line patch for K-PCS operation, and a corner-truncated square-ring microstrip patch antenna with four-slits for GPS operation.","","0-7803-8302-8","10.1109/APS.2004.1330107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1330107","","Dual band;Microstrip antennas;Patch antennas;Global Positioning System;Antennas and propagation;Antenna feeds;Polarization;Resonance;Optimized production technology;Microwave propagation","mobile antennas;Global Positioning System;cellular radio;mobile handsets;personal communication networks;monopole antennas;microstrip antennas;electromagnetic wave polarisation;antenna theory;antenna feeds;design engineering;antenna arrays","compact dual-band microstrip patch antenna design;multi-band antenna;GPS;K-PCS;feeding port;multiple resonance technology;polarization efficiency;GPS signal reception;integrated GPS/K-PCS dual-band antenna;matched polarization;miniaturization technique;antenna size;antenna slits;electrical surface length;operating frequency;referenced antenna size;low-profile cylindrical monopole;top-loaded meander line patch;corner-truncated square-ring microstrip patch","","4","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Proceedings.","","2004","","","3","4","Data mining is the process of posing queries and extracting patterns, often previously unknown from large quantities of data using pattern matching or other reasoning techniques. Cyber security is the area that deals with cyber terrorism. We are hearing that cyber attacks will cause corporations billions of dollars. For example, one could masquerade as a legitimate user and swindle say a bank of billions of dollars. Data mining and web mining may be used to detect and possibly prevent security attacks including cyber attacks. For example, anomaly detection techniques could be used to detect unusual patterns and behaviors. Link analysis may be used to trace the viruses to the perpetrators. Classification may be used to group various cyber attacks and then use the profiles to detect an attack when it occurs. Prediction may be used to determine potential future attacks depending in a way on information learnt about terrorists through email and phone conversations. Also, for some threats non real-time data mining may suffice while for certain other threats such as for network intrusions we may need real-time data mining. Many researchers are investigating the use of data mining for intrusion detection. While we need some form of real-time data mining, that is, the results have to be generated in real-time, we also need to build models in real-time. For example, credit card fraud detection is a form of real-time processing. However, here models are built ahead of time. Building models in real-time remains a challenge. Data mining can also be used for analyzing web logs as well as analyzing the audit trails. Based on the results of the data mining tool, one can then determine whether any unauthorized intrusions have occurred and/or whether any unauthorized queries have been posed. There has been much research on data mining for intrusion detection. Data mining may also be applied for Biometrics related applications. Finally data mining has applications in national security including detecting and preventing terrorist activities. The presentation will provide an overview of data mining and security threats and then discuss the applications of data mining for cyber security and national security including in intrusion detection and biometrics. Privacy considerations including a discussion of privacy preserving data mining will also be given.

Instead of assuming the same role for all the sensors, we envision a hierarchical sensor network that is composed of 1) a static backbone of sparsely placed high-capability sensors which assume the role of a cluster head (CH) upon triggered by certain signal events and 2) moderately to densely populated low-end sensors whose function is to provide sensor information to CHs upon request. A cluster is formed and a CH becomes active, when the acoustic signal strength detected by the CH exceeds a predetermined threshold. The active CH then broadcasts an information solicitation packet, asking sensors in its vicinity to join the cluster and provide their sensing information. We address and devise solution approaches (with the use of Voronoi diagram) to realize dynamic clustering: (I1) how CHs operate with one another to ensure that only one CH (preferably the CH that is closes to the target) is active with high probability, (I2) when the active CH solicits for sensor information, instead of having all the sensors in its vicinity reply, only a sufficient number of sensors respond with nonredundant, essential information to determine the target location, and (I3) both the packets that sensors send to their CHs and packets that CHs report to subscribers do not incur significant collision.

In the absence of the fixed infrastructure that characterizes traditional wireless networks, control and management of wireless ad hoc networks must be distributed across the nodes, thus requiring carefully designed medium access control (MAC) layer protocols. In this article we survey, classify, and analyze 34 MAC layer protocols for wireless ad hoc networks, ranging from industry standards to research proposals. Through this analysis, six key features emerge: (1) channel separation and access; (2) topology; (3) power; (4) transmission initiation; (5) traffic load and scalability; and (6) range. These features allow us to characterize and classify the protocols, to analyze the tradeoffs produced by different design decisions, and to assess the suitability of various design combinations for ad hoc network applications. The classification and the tradeoff analysis yield design guidelines for future wireless ad hoc network MAC layer protocols.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2004.5342231","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5342231","","Media Access Protocol;Access protocols;Ad hoc networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Wireless application protocol;Wireless communication;Wireless networks;Communication system control;Proposals;Network topology","access protocols;ad hoc networks;telecommunication control;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic","medium access control protocols;wireless ad hoc networks;wireless communications;wireless network control;wireless network management;channel separation;transmission initiation;traffic load;MAC layer protocols","","141","","47","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A real-time 3-D gaze tracking system has been developed which can provide 30 gaze measurements per second. Moreover, a simple and accurate calibration method is proposed to calibrate the gaze tracking system. Before using the system, each user only has to stare at a target point for a few (2-3) seconds so that the constant angle between the 3-D line of sight and the optical axis can be estimated. The test results of six subjects showed that the gaze tracking system is very promising achieving an average estimation error of under 1/spl deg/.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2003.811128","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1262497","","Cameras;Calibration;Target tracking;Stereo vision;Computer vision;Light sources;Computer errors;Real time systems;System testing;Estimation error","tracking;computer vision;light sources;calibration;user interfaces;cameras;eye;human computer interaction;visual perception","three-dimensional gaze tracking;3D computer vision technique;multiple point light source;optical axis;system calibration process;gaze measurement;eye tracking;human-computer interface;vision line sight;stereo camera;estimation error","Eye;Eye Movements;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Models, Biological;Photogrammetry;Video Recording","151","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The algorithms were analyzed by tabulating true and false detections when applied to a set of realistic artificial neural signals with known spike times and varying signal to noise ratios. A design-specific cost function was developed to score the relative merits of each detector; correct detections increased the score, while false detections and computational burden reduced it. Test signals both with and without overlapping action potentials were considered. We also investigated the utility of rejecting spikes that violate a minimum refractory period by occurring within a fixed time window after the preceding threshold crossing. Our results indicate that the cost-function scores for the absolute value operator were comparable to those for more elaborate nonlinear energy operator based detectors. The absolute value operator scores were enhanced when the refractory period check was used. Matched-filter-based detectors scored poorly due to their relatively large computational requirements that would be difficult to implement in a real-time system.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2004.826683","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1300781","","Detectors;Hardware;Signal to noise ratio;Application specific integrated circuits;Testing;Extracellular;Biomedical engineering;Bandwidth;Signal analysis;Algorithm design and analysis","brain;bioelectric potentials;neurophysiology;medical computing;handicapped aids","spike-detection algorithms;brain-machine interface application;realistic artificial neural signals;overlapping action potentials;design-specific cost function;threshold crossing;nonlinear energy operator based detectors;absolute value operator;refractory period check;matched-filter-based detectors","Action Potentials;Algorithms;Animals;Brain;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electroencephalography;Neurons;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;User-Computer Interface","160","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main failure mechanisms include loss of electrolyte through outgassing and chemical changes to the electrolyte and oxide layer. All the degradation mechanisms are exacerbated by ripple current heating. Since the equivalent series resistance of electrolytic capacitors is a very strong function of frequency it must be properly modeled to accurately calculate the power loss. In this paper, a method to reduce the ripple current in a constant Volts/Hertz pulse-amplitude-modulation (PAM)/pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) converter driving an induction motor is investigated. The dc-bus voltage amplitude is reduced in proportion to speed by a buck or current stiff rectifier and the PWM modulation index is maintained at a high level to achieve a reduced ripple current below base speed. By comparison with a diode-bridge-fed PWM voltage stiff inverter, it is shown that the PAM/PWM mode of operation can lead to a significant reduction in capacitor power loss leading to increased capacitor lifetime or decreased capacitor size. The capacitor heating is analyzed using numerical and analytical techniques. Experimental results are provided to verify the analytical results.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2004.824495","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1278641","","Capacitors;Pulse width modulation converters;Pulse width modulation;Pulse width modulation inverters;Heating;Voltage;Variable speed drives;Failure analysis;Chemicals;Degradation","PWM power convertors;electrolytic capacitors;induction motor drives;PWM invertors","pulse amplitude modulation converter;PAM converter;pulse width modulation converter;PWM converter;DC bus capacitor ripple current;electrolytic capacitors;ripple current heating;power loss;induction motor;PWM modulation;capacitor heating","","84","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this limitation, the concept of cooperation diversity has been introduced, where mobiles achieve uplink transmit diversity by relaying each other's messages. A particularly powerful variation of this principle is coded cooperation. Instead of a simple repetition relay, coded cooperation partitions the codewords of each mobile and transmits portions of each codeword through independent fading channels. This paper presents two extensions to the coded cooperation framework. First, we increase the diversity of coded cooperation in the fast-fading scenario via ideas borrowed from space-time codes. We calculate bounds for the bit- and block-error rates to demonstrate the resulting gains. Second, since cooperative coding contains two code components, it is natural to apply turbo codes to this framework. We investigate the application of turbo codes in coded cooperation and demonstrate the resulting gains via error bounds and simulations.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2003.821100","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1261324","","Wireless communication;Iterative decoding;Relays;Space time codes;Mobile antennas;Transmitting antennas;Fading;Turbo codes;Transmitters;System performance","mobile radio;space-time codes;turbo codes;iterative decoding;data communication;diversity reception;antenna arrays;fading channels;channel coding;block codes","coded cooperation;wireless communication;space-time transmission;iterative decoding;multiple antennas;transmit diversity;independent fading channels;space-time codes;channel coding;bit-error rates;block-error rates;turbo codes;user cooperation","","627","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Spontaneous emission from inline optical amplifiers is assumed to be the dominant noise source in all cases. Coherent detection allows use of two degrees of freedom per polarization, and its spectral efficiency limits are several b/s/Hz in typical terrestrial systems, even considering nonlinear effects. Using either constant-intensity modulation or direct detection, only one degree of freedom per polarization can be used, significantly reducing spectral efficiency. Using binary modulation, regardless of detection technique, spectral efficiency cannot exceed 1 b/s/Hz per polarization. When the number of signal and/or noise photons is small, the particle nature of photons must be considered. The quantum-limited spectral efficiency for coherent detection is slightly smaller than the classical capacity, but that for direct detection is 0.3 b/s/Hz higher than its classical counterpart. Various binary and nonbinary modulation techniques, in conjunction with appropriate detection techniques, are compared in terms of their spectral efficiencies and signal-to-noise ratio requirements, assuming amplified spontaneous emission is the dominant noise source.

To achieve more accurate document clustering, more informative features including phrases and their weights are particularly important in such scenarios. Document clustering is particularly useful in many applications such as automatic categorization of documents, grouping search engine results, building a taxonomy of documents, and others. This article presents two key parts of successful document clustering. The first part is a novel phrase-based document index model, the document index graph, which allows for incremental construction of a phrase-based index of the document set with an emphasis on efficiency, rather than relying on single-term indexes only. It provides efficient phrase matching that is used to judge the similarity between documents. The model is flexible in that it could revert to a compact representation of the vector space model if we choose not to index phrases. The second part is an incremental document clustering algorithm based on maximizing the tightness of clusters by carefully watching the pair-wise document similarity distribution inside clusters. The combination of these two components creates an underlying model for robust and accurate document similarity calculation that leads to much improved results in Web document clustering over traditional methods.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2004.58","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1324634","Index Terms- Web mining;document similarity;phrase-based indexing;document clustering;document structure;document index graph;phrase matching.","Indexing;Data mining;Clustering methods;Information retrieval;Taxonomy;Clustering algorithms;Text mining;Web mining;Artificial intelligence;Data models","Internet;indexing;document handling;data mining;pattern clustering","single term analysis;document data set;vector space model;automatic categorization;search engine;phrase-based document index model;document index graph;phrase matching;pair-wise document similarity distribution;Web document clustering;Web mining;document structure","","162","","45","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A single image histogram, however, suffers from the inability to encode spatial image variation. An obvious way to extend this feature is to compute the histograms of multiple resolutions of an image to form a multiresolution histogram. The multiresolution histogram shares many desirable properties with the plain histogram, including that they are both fast to compute, space efficient, invariant to rigid motions, and robust to noise. In addition, the multiresolution histogram directly encodes spatial information. We describe a simple yet novel matching algorithm based on the multiresolution histogram that uses the differences between histograms of consecutive image resolutions. We evaluate it against five widely used image features. We show that with our simple feature we achieve or exceed the performance obtained with more complicated features.

To optimize power consumption, the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology has developed WiseNET, an ultralow-power platform for the implementation of wireless sensor networks that achieves low-power operation through a careful codesign approach. The WiseNET platform uses a codesign approach that combines a dedicated duty-cycled radio with WiseMAC, a low-power media access control protocol, and a complex system-on-chip sensor node to exploit the intimate relationship between MAC-layer performance and radio transceiver parameters.

The purpose of the control allocation portion of the guidance and control architecture is to distribute control power among redundant control effectors to meet the desired control objectives under a set of constraints. Most existing algorithms neglect the actuator dynamics or deal with the actuator dynamics separately, thereby assuming a static relationship between actuator outputs (in our case, control surface deflections) and plant inputs (i.e., moments about the three body axis). We propose a dynamic control allocation scheme based on model-based predictive control (MPC) that directly takes into account actuators with noneligible dynamics and hard constraints. Model-based predictive control schemes compute the control inputs by optimizing an open-loop control objective over a future time interval at each control step. In our setup, the model-predictive control allocation problem is posed as a sequential quadratic programming problem with dynamic constraints, which can be cast into a linear complementary problem (LCP) and therefore solved by linear programming approaches in a finite number of iterations. The time-varying affine internal model used in the MPC design enhances the ability of the control loop to deal with unmodeled system nonlinearities. The approach can be easily extended to encompass a variety of linear actuator dynamics without the need to redesign the overall scheme. Results are based on the model of an experimental reusable launch vehicle, and compared with that of existing static control allocation schemes.","0743-1619","0-7803-8335-4","10.23919/ACC.2004.1386823","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1386823","","Predictive models;Actuators;Vehicle dynamics;Open loop systems;Power system modeling;Vehicles;Navigation;Predictive control;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Heuristic algorithms","aircraft control;predictive control;vehicle dynamics;control nonlinearities;open loop systems;linear programming;actuators;time-varying systems;quadratic programming","model based predictive control;dynamic control allocation algorithm;linear actuator dynamics;reentry vehicle guidance system;vehicle control system;control architecture;control power distribution;redundant control effectors;open loop control;sequential quadratic programming problem;linear complementary problem;linear programming;iteration methods;time varying affine internal model;unmodeled system nonlinearities;reusable launch vehicle;dynamic constraints","","12","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An analytical model for DRV as a function of process and design parameters is presented, and forms the basis for further design space explorations.

Assuming a block fading channel model and minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation at the receiver, we design the transmitted signal to optimize two criteria: MMSE and the conditional mutual information between the MIMO channel and the received signal. Our analysis is based on the recently proposed virtual channel representation, which corresponds to beamforming in fixed virtual directions and exposes the structure and the true degrees of freedom in the correlated channel. However, our design framework is applicable to more general channel models, which include known channel models, such as the transmit and receive correlated model, as special cases. We show that optimal signaling is in a block form, where the block length depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as well as the channel correlation matrix. The block signal corresponds to transmitting beams in successive symbol intervals along fixed virtual transmit angles, whose powers are determined by (nonidentical) water filling solutions based on the optimization criteria. Our analysis shows that these water filling solutions identify exactly which virtual transmit angles are important for channel estimation. In particular, at low SNR, the block length reduces to one, and all the power is transmitted on the beam corresponding to the strongest transmit angle, whereas at high SNR, the block length has a maximum length equal to the number of active virtual transmit angles, and the power is assigned equally to all active transmit angles. Consequently, from a channel estimation viewpoint, a faster fading rate can be tolerated at low SNRs relative to higher SNRs.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2003.821104","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1261339","","Signal design;MIMO;Fading;Filling;Channel estimation;Statistics;Transmitters;Mean square error methods;Estimation error;Design optimization","channel estimation;antenna theory;MIMO systems;least mean squares methods;fading channels;receivers;optimisation;feedback;antenna arrays","transmit signal design;optimal estimation;correlated MIMO channels;multiple-input multiple-output;second-order channel statistics;transmitter;block fading channel;receiver;MMSE;virtual channel representation;SNR;signal-to-noise ratio;channel correlation matrix;optimization;channel estimation;virtual transmit angle;Schur-concavity;Shur-convexity;uniform linear array;multiantenna systems;conditional mutual information;feedback","","199","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, using CMOS-TG as a bidirectional switch, the various topologies can be integrated in the same configuration for achieving two functions: boosting and alternating; boosting for getting a sinusoidal output in which the peak is the result of a many times step-up of the input; alternating to realize the positive/negative half sinusoidal of the output. The inverter does not require any inductive elements as inductor and transformer, so integrated circuit (IC) fabrication will be promising for realization. By using the state-space averaging technique, the large-signal state-space model of the inverter is proposed, and then both the static analysis and dynamic small-signal analysis are derived to form a unified formulation for inverter/converter. Based on this formulation, there are presented for theoretical analysis/control design, including steady-state power, conversion efficiency, voltage conversion ratio, output ripple percentage, capacitance selection, closed-loop control and stability, and total harmonic distortion (THD), etc. Finally, a six-stage QSC boost DC-AC inverter is simulated by PSPICE, and the simulations are discussed for some cases, including: 1) steady-state AC output, ripple percentage, and power efficiency; 2) transient response of the regulated inverter for load variation; 3) a practical capacitive load: electromagnetic luminescent (EL) lamp, and 4) efficiency, ripple percentage, and THD for different loads.

The approach enables reliable skin segmentation despite wide variation in illumination during tracking. An explicit second order Markov model is used to predict evolution of the skin-color (HSV) histogram over time. Histograms are dynamically updated based on feedback from the current segmentation and predictions of the Markov model. The evolution of the skin-color distribution at each frame is parameterized by translation, scaling, and rotation in color space. Consequent changes in geometric parameterization of the distribution are propagated by warping and resampling the histogram. The parameters of the discrete-time dynamic Markov model are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation and also evolve over time. The accuracy of the new dynamic skin color segmentation algorithm is compared to that obtained via a static color model. Segmentation accuracy is evaluated using labeled ground-truth video sequences taken from staged experiments and popular movies. An overall increase in segmentation accuracy of up to 24 percent is observed in 17 out of 21 test sequences.

This analysis shows that the p and q powers are not associated with separate power phenomena, but with multiple phenomena. Moreover, the results of the IRP p-q theory contradict some common interpretations of power phenomena in three-phase circuits. Namely, according to the IRP p-q Theory the instantaneous reactive current can occur even if a load has zero reactive power, Q. Similarly, the instantaneous active current can occur even if a load has zero active power, P. Moreover, these two currents in circuits with a sinusoidal supply voltage can be nonsinusoidal even if there is no source of current distortion in the load. The analysis shows that a pair of values of instantaneous active and reactive p and q powers does not enable us to draw any conclusion with respect to the power properties of three-phase unbalanced loads even in a sinusoidal situation. Thus, the instantaneous reactive power p-q theory does not identify power properties of such loads instantaneously. This conclusion may have an importance for control algorithms of active power filters.

A single two-way laser link, performing simultaneously communication and range estimation functions between formation spacecraft is being investigated in the framework of Broadband Laser Inter-Satellite Link (BLSIL), a joint Israeli-German applied research project. A unique technique of pointing control system for an intersatellite laser communication and ranging link is presented. In this system, the same laser is used both as a beacon and as a transmitter. To maximize the traffic capacity of the link, the beamwidth is controlled from broad in the acquisition stage, to narrow in the tracking stage. Laser link pointing control presents difficult demands from the beam pointing precision. To establish and maintain the laser link between the satellites in orbit, pointing control must be fast and precise. A hierarchic two-level system control is proposed. The lower level controls the gimbals of the optical head of the electro-optical transceiver; the higher level is a fast closed loop that simultaneously controls the beamwidth and direction. It is the primary subject of the paper. Initial pointing acquisition assumes exchange of position-related information between the satellites to establish the initial line of sight (LOS). After initial acquisition a cooperative extremum-seeking algorithm is used for the fast higher level closed loop control. The paper gives a detailed description of the control algorithms. Representative simulations are presented.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2004.1386877","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1386877","","Optical control;Communication system control;Control systems;Optical transmitters;Communication system traffic control;Lasers and electrooptics;Satellites;Power lasers;Availability;Space vehicles","optical links;satellite links;optical communication equipment;telecommunication control;pointing systems;space vehicles;laser ranging;aerospace control","inter-satellite laser communications;formation members;laser free-space link;microsatellite formation flying missions;two-way laser link;range estimation functions;formation spacecraft;Broadband Laser Inter-Satellite Link;joint Israeli-German applied research project;pointing control system;ranging link;traffic capacity;acquisition stage;tracking stage;beam pointing precision;two-level system control;optical head;electro-optical transceiver;pointing acquisition;position-related information;cooperative extremum-seeking algorithm;higher level closed loop control","","55","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most work on real-time camera based object tracking from moving platforms has used sparse features or assumed flat scene structures. We have recently extended a real-time, dense stereo system to include real-time, dense optical flow, enabling more comprehensive dynamic scene analysis. We describe algorithms to robustly estimate 6-DOF robot egomotion in the presence of moving objects using dense flow and dense stereo. We then use dense stereo and egomotion estimates to identify other moving objects while the robot itself is moving. We present results showing accurate egomotion estimation and detection of moving people and vehicles under general 6-DOF motion of the robot and independently moving objects. The system runs at 18.3 Hz on a 1.4 GHz Pentium M laptop, computing 160/spl times/120 disparity maps and optical flow fields, egomotion, and moving object segmentation.

As a semi-formal modelling language, UML is widely used to describe analysis and design specifications by both academia and industry, thus UML models become the sources of test generation naturally. Test cases are usually generated from the requirement or the code while the design is seldom concerned, this paper proposes an approach to generate test cases directly from UML activity diagram using Gray-box method, where the design is reused to avoid the cost of test model creation. In this approach, test scenarios are directly derived from the activity diagram modelling an operation. Then all the information for test case generation, i.e. input/output sequence and parameters, the constraint conditions and expected object method sequence, is extracted from each test scenario. At last, the possible values of all the input/output parameters could be generated by applying category-partition method, and test suite could be systematically generated to find the inconsistency between the implementation and the design. A prototype tool named UMLTGF has been developed to support the above process.","1530-1362","0-7695-2245-9","10.1109/APSEC.2004.55","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1371930","gray-box method;UML activity diagram;test scenario;test case","Computer aided software engineering;Unified modeling language;Software testing;Automatic testing;System testing;Pressing;Programming;Computer industry;Laboratories;Computer science","program testing;Unified Modeling Language;formal specification;software metrics;software quality","UML activity diagram;Gray-box method;test case generation;formal specification;semi-formal modelling language;object method sequence;category-partition method;MLTGF prototype tool","","65","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is desirable for a robot to carry out human following, as one of the human-affinitive movements. The human-following robot requires several techniques: the recognition of the target human, the recognition of the environment around the robot, and the control strategy for following a human stably. In this research, an intelligent environment is used in order to achieve these goals. An intelligent environment is a space in which many sensors and intelligent devices are distributed. Mobile robots exist in this space as physical agents providing humans with services. A mobile robot is controlled to follow a walking human using distributed intelligent sensors as stably and precisely as possible.

Data aggregation has emerged as a basic approach in WSNs in order to reduce the number of transmissions of sensor nodes, and hence minimizing the overall power consumption in the network. We study optimal data aggregation in WSNs. Data aggregation is affected by several factors, such as the placement of aggregation points, the aggregation function, and the density of sensors in the network. The determination of an optimal selection of aggregation points is thus extremely important. We present exact and approximate algorithms to find the minimum number of aggregation points in order to maximize the network lifetime. Our algorithms use a fixed virtual wireless backbone that is built on top of the physical topology.

The digital noise cancellation filter design is determined using continuous-time to discrete-time transformation of the sigma-delta loopfilter transfer functions. The required matching between the analog and digital filter coefficients is achieved by means of simple digital calibration of the noise cancellation filter. Measurement results of a 0.18-/spl mu/m CMOS prototype chip demonstrate 67-dB dynamic range in a 10-MHz bandwidth at 8 times oversampling for a single continuous-time cascaded modulator. Two cascaded modulators in quadrature configuration provide 20-MHz aggregate bandwidth.

Three to four times as many driving-related deaths occur at night than in the daytime. To improve the safety of night driving, automatic pedestrian detection based on infrared images has drawn increased attention because pedestrians tend to stand out more against the background in infrared images than they do in visible light images. Nevertheless, pedestrian detection in infrared images is by no means trivial-many of the known difficulties carry over from visible light images, such as image variability occasioned by pedestrians being in different poses. Typically, several different pedestrian templates have to be used in order to deal with a range of poses. Furthermore, pedestrian detection is difficult because of poor infrared image quality (low resolution, low contrast, few distinguishable feature points, little texture information, etc.) and misleading signals. To address these problems, this paper introduces a shape-independent pedestrian-detection method. Our segmentation algorithm first estimates pedestrians' horizontal locations through projection-based horizontal segmentation and then determines pedestrians' vertical locations through brightness/bodyline-based vertical segmentation. Our classification method defines multidimensional histogram-, inertia-, and contrast-based classification features. The features are shape-independent, complementary to one another, and capture the statistical similarities of image patches containing pedestrians with different poses. Thus, our pedestrian-detection system needs only one pedestrian template-corresponding to a generic walking pose-and avoids brute-force searching for pedestrians throughout whole images, which typically involves brightness-similarity comparisons between candidate image patches and a multiplicity of pedestrian templates. Our pedestrian-detection system is neither based on tracking nor does it depend on camera calibration to determine the relationship between an object's height and its vertical image locations. Thus, it is less restricted in applicability. Even if much work is still needed to bridge the gap between present pedestrian-detection performance and the high reliability required for real-world applications, our pedestrian-detection system is straightforward and provides encouraging results in improving speed, reliability, and simplicity.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2004.834875","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1360128","Autonomous driving;classification;infrared image processing;intelligent transportation system (ITS);intelligent vehicle (IV);night vision;pattern recognition;pedestrian detection;shape independent","Infrared detectors;Infrared imaging;Image segmentation;Safety;Image quality;Image resolution;Signal resolution;Brightness;Multidimensional systems;Legged locomotion","road vehicles;image segmentation;image classification;cameras;reliability;night vision;image sequences","shape-independent method;pedestrian detection method;far-infrared images;image segmentation algorithm;projection-based horizontal segmentation;vertical segmentation;image classification method;multidimensional histogram;image patches;reliability;autonomous driving;intelligent transportation system;intelligent vehicles;night vision;pattern recognition;inertia-based features;contrast-based features","","95","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This high ratio may result either from wide channel devices, designed to achieve high transconductance, or from short-channel-length devices used in high-frequency circuits. Since drain current is generally proportional to the W/L ratio, the effective gate-to-source voltage to achieve a desired drain current is typically quite low. In many cases, this set of circumstances leads to operation in the weak or moderate inversion region accompanied by electrical behavior that differs significantly from that in the strong inversion region. In designing analog MOS circuits, an understanding of operation below the strong inversion region is necessary to relate design predictions to simulation results. In addition, biasing simple amplifier stages near the weak or moderate inversion region can be used to advantage. Such a bias can lead to maximum voltage gain, low device dissipation, and minimum total harmonic distortion.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2004.825537","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1356090","Low-distortion stage;moderate inversion;strong inversion;subthreshold region;weak inversion","MOS analog integrated circuits;Semiconductor-insulator interfaces","MOS analogue integrated circuits;inversion layers","analog MOS circuit design;moderate inversion region;weak inversion region;metal-oxide-semiconductor circuit;wide channel devices;transconductance;short-channel-length devices;high-frequency circuits;drain current;gate-to-source voltage;electrical behavior;amplifier biasing","","26","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two forms of weighted PCA are discussed: sample-wise and variable-wise. Sample-wise weighted PCA is used to address issues with model updating. By adapting models with process changes, the long-term validity of a PCA model can be maintained. We also propose to deal with drift and shift features separately. Variable-wise weighted PCA is used to incorporate process and sensor knowledge. PCA models built this way require less maintenance and result in better FDC performance. We performed comparison studies on plasma etcher FDC. We have shown that weighted PCA can adapt to process drift, reduce the occurrence of false alarms and make the models easy to maintain.","0191-2216","0-7803-8682-5","10.1109/CDC.2004.1429421","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1429421","","Principal component analysis;Etching;Plasma applications;Plasma materials processing;Fault detection;Monitoring;Semiconductor device manufacture;Integrated circuit yield;Integrated circuit manufacture;Electrical fault detection","principal component analysis;fault diagnosis;semiconductor device manufacture;sputter etching","fault detection;fault classification;sample-wise weighted principal component analysis;variable-wise weighted principal component analysis;process changes;process shift;process drift;sensor knowledge;process knowledge;plasma etcher;false alarms","","20","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

New ZVT-ZCT-PWM converter equipped with the proposed snubber cell provides most the desirable features of both ZVT and ZCT converters presented previously, and overcomes most the drawbacks of these converters. Subsequently, the new converter can operate with soft switching successfully at very wide line and load ranges and at considerably high frequencies. Moreover, all semiconductor devices operate under soft switching, the main devices do not have any additional voltage and current stresses, and the stresses on the auxiliary devices are at low levels.

They are used extensively for heating, cooling, refrigeration, pumping, conveyors, and similar applications. They offer users simple, rugged construction, easy maintenance, and cost-effective pricing. These factors have promoted standardization and development of a manufacturing infrastructure that has led to a vast installed base of motors; more than 90% of all motors used in industry worldwide are ac induction motors. Causes of motor failures are bearing faults, insulation faults, and rotor faults. Early detection of bearing faults allows replacement of the bearings, rather than replacement of the motor. The same type of bearing defects that plague such larger machines as 100 hp are mirrored in lower hp machines which has the same type of bearings. Even though the replacement of defective bearings is the cheapest fix among the three causes of failure, it is the most difficult one to detect. Motors that are in continuous use cannot be stopped for analysis. We have developed a circuit monitor for these motors. Incipient bearing failures are detectable by the presence of characteristic machine vibration frequencies associated with the various modes of bearing failure. We will show that circuit monitors that we developed can detect these frequencies using wavelet packet decomposition and a radial basis neural network. This device monitors an induction motor's current and defines a bearing failure.","1941-0123","","10.1109/MIM.2004.1383462","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1383462","","Fault detection;Circuit faults;Induction motors;Condition monitoring;Construction industry;Manufacturing industries;AC motors;Frequency;Heat pumps;Cooling","induction motors;electric machine analysis computing;machine bearings;radial basis function networks","motor bearing fault detection;three-phase induction motors;manufacturing infrastructure;ac induction motors;motor failures;bearing faults;insulation faults;rotor faults;circuit monitor;bearing failures;machine vibration frequency;wavelet packet decomposition;radial basis neural network","","76","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Proceedings of","","2004","","","92","96","Spatial data clustering is one of the important data mining techniques for extracting knowledge from large amount of spatial data collected in various applications, such as remote sensing, GIS, computer cartography, environmental assessment and planning, etc. Several useful and popular spatial data clustering algorithms have been proposed in the past decade. DBSCAN is one of them, which can discover clusters of any arbitrary shape and can handle the noise points effectively. However, DBSCAN requires large volume of memory support because it operates on the entire database. This paper presents an improved sampling-based DBSCAN which can cluster large-scale spatial databases effectively.

We focus on the case where the base station is remotely located and the sensor nodes are not mobile. Since we are concerned with the overall network dimensioning problem, we take into account the manufacturing cost of the hardware as well as the battery energy of the nodes. A homogeneous sensor network consists of identical nodes, while a heterogeneous sensor network consists of two or more types of nodes (organized into hierarchical clusters). We first consider single hop clustered sensor networks (nodes use single hopping to reach the cluster heads). We use LEACH as the representative single hop homogeneous network, and a sensor network with two types of nodes as a representative single hop heterogeneous network. For multihop homogeneous networks (nodes use multihopping to reach the cluster head), we propose and analyze a multihop variant of LEACH that we call M-LEACH. We show that M-LEACH has better energy efficiency than LEACH in many cases. We then compare the cost of multihop clustered sensor networks with M-LEACH as the representative homogeneous network, and a sensor network with two types of nodes (that use in-cluster multi-hopping) as the representative heterogeneous network.","","0-7803-8533-0","10.1109/ICC.2004.1313223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1313223","","Hardware;Batteries;Costs;Spread spectrum communication;Base stations;Energy efficiency;Wireless sensor networks;Routing;Contracts;Computer networks","wireless sensor networks;military communication","multihop wireless sensor networks;remote base station;network dimensioning problem;hierarchical clusters;single hop sensor networks;LEACH;M-LEACH;homogeneous clustered sensor networks;heterogeneous clustered sensor networks","","180","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is shown in the paper, using general theory of electrical machines, that an increase of the stator phase number to at least five (or more) enables completely independent vector control of two (or more) multiphase machines that are supplied from a single current-controlled voltage source inverter. In order to achieve such an independent control it is necessary to connect multiphase stator windings of the machines in series and perform an appropriate phase sequence transposition. The concept is equally applicable to any multiphase ac machine type and its major advantage, compared to an equivalent multimotor three-phase drive system, is the saving of a certain number of inverter legs. The actual saving depends on the number of phases. The concept is introduced using an n-phase induction machine as the starting point and further analysis is restricted to an odd number of phases, for the reason explained in the paper. Classification of all the possible cases that may arise is given, followed by presentation of connection diagrams for selected phase numbers. Detailed verification of the proposed concept is provided by simulating the operation of a seven-phase three-motor drive system, controlled using indirect rotor flux oriented control principles. Some preliminary experimental results, which confirm the feasibility of a two-motor series-connected drive system, are included as well. The main advantages and drawbacks of the concept, when compared with an equivalent three-phase multimotor drive system, are finally addressed.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2003.823241","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1271315","","Voltage control;Control systems;Inverters;AC machines;Electric variables control;Power supplies;Power electronics;Machine vector control;Stator windings;Leg","machine vector control;invertors;variable speed drives;power convertors;machine theory;asynchronous machines;electric current control;rotors;AC motor drives","multiphase machine;multimotor vector controlled drive system;single voltage source inverter;variable speed electric drive system;power electronic converter;electrical machine general theory;multiphase stator windings;n-phase induction machine;indirect rotor flux oriented control","","160","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

They have been in use for some time for demining and rescue operations but now they are under research for combat or spy missions. Today's modern military forces are using different kinds of robots for different applications ranging from mine detection, surveillance, logistics and rescue operations. In the future they will be used for reconnaissance and surveillance, logistics and support, communications infrastructure, forward-deployed offensive operations, and as tactical decoys to conceal maneuver by manned assets. In order to make robots for the unpredicted cluttered environment of the battlefield, research on different aspects of robots is under investigation in laboratories to be able to do its job autonomously, as efficiently as a human operated machine can do. Latest techniques are being investigated to have advanced and intelligent robots for different operations. This paper presents different kinds of robotic technologies being used in all the three main forces, Navy, Army and Air.

In this paper, we investigate the novelty of reversing the order of these steps, i.e., first encrypting and then compressing, without compromising either the compression efficiency or the information-theoretic security. Although counter-intuitive, we show surprisingly that, through the use of coding with side information principles, this reversal of order is indeed possible in some settings of interest without loss of either optimal coding efficiency or perfect secrecy. We show that in certain scenarios our scheme requires no more randomness in the encryption key than the conventional system where compression precedes encryption. In addition to proving the theoretical feasibility of this reversal of operations, we also describe a system which implements compression of encrypted data.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2004.833860","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337277","","Cryptography;Data security;Information security;Decoding;Data compression;Information theory;Communication system security;Source coding;Communication channels;Strips","source coding;channel coding;cryptography","compressing encrypted data;bandwidth-constrained channel;information-theoretic security","","157","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Considerable attention has been focused to develop policies that minimize the environmental impacts of electronic waste in general, but there is little consistency between the strategies because trade-offs between economic costs and environmental benefits are not well understood. This paper presents results of a survey conducted to better understand the economics of cell phone recycling. We find that the net cost to recyclers of collecting each cell phone ($6) far exceeds the estimated cost to transport, sort, dismantle, refine, and dispose of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes ($0.74) associated with discarded phones. These results were compared with the collection and processing cost of PCs for which recycling is typically not profitable.

However, it seems that the problem of overtaking a slower moving vehicle has been somewhat neglected. This note deals with the three-phase overtaking maneuver and with designing a smooth and ergonomic optimal lane-change trajectory to be used under normal conditions. It is shown that the absolute shape, size, and time of the first-phase trajectory do not depend on the velocity of the leading, slower moving vehicle. Only the absolute point for initiating the diversion is affected. The relatively simple mathematical model for each lane-change trajectory is based on minimizing the total kinetic energy during the maneuver, superimposed on a ""minimum-jerk trajectory."" For high enough initial velocities, explicit formulas are obtained for the optimal distance and the optimal time of the maneuver. It is also shown that the total time is bounded from above and below, regardless of the velocity. By using the results of the suggested model, an autonomous vehicle, equipped with appropriate sensors, can estimate the best time and place to begin and end the overtaking and its total time and distance. This may help to make a decision whether to overtake or not.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2004.825632","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1284727","","Remotely operated vehicles;Mobile robots;Vehicle dynamics;Acceleration;Ergonomics;Shape;Road vehicles;Constraint optimization;Optimal control;Mathematical model","road vehicles;optimal control;velocity;nonlinear systems;optimisation;collision avoidance;automatic guided vehicles","autonomous vehicle control;optimal trajectory;three-phase overtaking maneuver;lane-change trajectory;total kinetic energy;minimum-jerk trajectory;optimal distance;optimal time;nonlinear optimization;obstacle avoidance","","64","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By the comparison of the transition bandwidth (/spl Delta//spl omega/), stopband attenuation gain (Astop) of these filters, we can learn the frequency response of these filters. Furthermore, we use the mean square error (MSE) to estimate the effect of the digital filters in order to reduce the embedded 60 Hz noise. We compute the mean square error with respect to the order, N, of these filters and plot the relationship of MSE and N. In addition, we find the relationship of the CPU time and N, and we also learn that the CPU time is in proportion to the order, N, of the filters.

We derive the theoretical limit of delay and energy consumption in MOSFET subthreshold circuit, and show that devices that have an ideal subthreshold slope are optimal for subthreshold operations due to the smaller gate capacitance, as well as the higher current. The analysis suggests that a double gate (DG)-MOSFET is promising for subthreshold operations due to its near-ideal subthreshold slope. The results of our investigation into the optimal device characteristics for DG-MOSFET subthreshold operation show that devices with longer channel length (compared to minimum gate length) can be used for robust subthreshold operation without any loss of performance.

The three-phase SEIG is driven by a variable-speed prime mover(VSPM) in addition to a constant-speed prime mover (CSPM) such as a wind turbine and a micro gas turbine for clean alternative renewable energy in rural areas. The basic steady-state characteristics of the VSPM are considered in the three-phase SEIG approximate equivalent circuit and the operating performance of the three-phase SEIG coupled with a VSPM and/or a CSPM are evaluated and discussed online under the conditions related to the speed changes of the prime mover and the electrical inductive load power variations with simple computation processing procedures. A three-phase SEIG prototype setup with a VSPM is implemented for small-scale clean renewable and alternative energy utilizations. The experimental performance results give good agreement with those obtained from the simulation results. Furthermore, a proportional-integral (PI) closed-loop feedback voltage regulation of the three-phase SEIG driven by the VSPM on the basis of the static var compensator (SVC) composed of the thyristor phase-controlled reactor in parallel with the thyristor switched capacitor and the fixed-excitation capacitor bank is designed and considered for the wind generation as a renewable power conditioner.

Problems associated with this controller, namely, the offset in the current measurements, the stator resistance variation, and the requirement of initial rotor position are addressed in this paper.

No.04CH37551)","","2004","3","","2070","2074 Vol.3","The application of battery backup systems automatically leads to inverter structures with relative low input voltage levels compared to the DC-link voltage. To guarantee the required system capability the power electronic system has to maintain the resulting high input current ratings. This leads to a problematic design with noticeable efficiency restrictions. To improve the overall efficiency of the inverter and to reduce the input capacitor, a possible solution is the parallel operation of several converter stages. Here, a special disadvantage has to be marked: The parallel operation of conventional DC-to-DC converters with voltage source characteristics mostly used requires special control mechanism to ensure correct power distribution. Contrary to this behavior, current sourced converter types can act in parallel without any special measurements. The solution proposed in this paper is capable to improve the parallel operation of power stages in conventional converters with modern current sharing techniques. Due to the reduced current in each of the paralleled output stages, the efficiency will increase significantly. The ripple of the input current is shared between the different stages, which helps to reduce the input capacitor in each string. In addition, the resulting frequency rises with the number of used stages when multiphase operation is used. This leads to a more silent (EMC) design. Another big problem, the output rectifier operating at the high DC-link voltage, can be disburdened significantly by using the suggested current sourced inverter structure. In this paper a bidirectional 12V / 500 W current sourced inverter for solar battery applications is described. Due to the special design, it could be built up by the usage of cheap mass components.

In particular, the growth of the wireless communication industry has spurred tremendous activity in the area of microwave filter miniaturization and has been responsible for many advances made in this field. The filters that are currently being used in wireless base stations can be divided into two main categories: coaxial cavity resonator filters and dielectric resonator (DR) filters. While coaxial cavity filters have limited quality factor (Q) values, they offer the lowest cost design and are still being widely employed, particularly in wide bandwidth applications. With increased demands for high performance wireless systems, dielectric resonator filters are emerging as the baseline design for wireless base stations. Over the next five years, dielectric resonator filters are expected to have a significant share of the overall wireless base station filter market. High-temperature superconductor (HTS) filters are also expected to have a share of this market, particularly for systems, which have very stringent requirements for out-of-band interference. In this article, we begin by reviewing the main filter requirements, highlighting the technologies that are being currently employed. Emerging filter technologies that have the potential to replace the existing technologies are then described.","1557-9581","","10.1109/MMW.2004.1284945","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1284945","","Base stations;Resonator filters;Microwave filters;Superconducting filters;Dielectrics;Communication industry;Coaxial components;High temperature superconductors;Communications technology;Wireless communication","cellular radio;superconducting filters;dielectric resonator filters;microwave filters;high-temperature superconductors","filter technologies;wireless base stations;telecommunication industry;wireless communication;microwave filter miniaturization;coaxial cavity resonator filters;dielectric resonator;DR filters;quality factor;wide bandwidth applications;baseline design;high-temperature superconductor;HTS filters;out-of-band interference","","69","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The obstruction phenomenon due to the human bodies is characterized in duration and amplitude from the propagation characteristics (attenuation, coherence bandwidth) by means of an appropriate method. The results highlight and quantify the problems due to the human activity for high data rate communication systems. When the direct path is shadowed by a person, the attenuation generally increases by more than 20 dB, for a median duration of about 100 ms for an activity of one to five persons and 300 ms for 11-15 persons. Globally, the channel is ""unavailable"" for about 1% or 2% of the time in the presence of one to five persons.

Therefore, image enhancement is considered a difficult task when attempting to automate the analysis process and eliminate the human intervention. This paper introduces a new automatic image enhancement technique driven by an evolutionary optimization process. We propose a novel objective criterion for enhancement, and attempt finding the best image according to the respective criterion. Due to the high complexity of the enhancement criterion proposed, we employ an evolutionary algorithm (EA) as a global search strategy for the best enhancement.

"New building blocks for modular design of elliptic and self-equalized filters","S. Amari; U. Rosenberg","Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., R. Mil. Coll. of Canada, Kingston, Ont., Canada; NA","IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","","2004","52","2","721","736","This paper introduces building blocks for modular design of elliptic, pseudoelliptic, and self-equalized filters. The first building block is of second order and generates two transmission zeros (TZs), which are either on the real or imaginary axis. Moving the zeros from the real axis (linear phase response) to the imaginary axis (attenuation poles) requires changing the sign of one coupling coefficient. The second building block is a structure of order three, called extended doublet, which allows the generation of two TZs practically anywhere in the complex plane. An important property of this block is its ability to move the two TZs from the real axis to the imaginary axis of the complex s-plane without changing the signs of its coupling coefficients. The third building block is of third order and generates two TZs, which can be moved from the real to the imaginary axis by changing the sign of one coupling coefficient. Simple waveguide structures to implement these blocks are introduced for validation, although this general approach is feasible for all resonator filter types. Higher order filters are designed modularly by cascading an arbitrary number of these building blocks. A novel concept, which allows the independent control of each pair of TZs in higher order filters, is then introduced. It is shown that the new concept allows a filter of order N to generate N TZs without directly coupling the source to the load even when the coupling coefficients are all assumed frequency independent. The same approach can be used to design and reduce the sensitivity of higher order elliptic and pseudoelliptic filters using other building blocks such as doublets or a mixture of building blocks of different orders and properties. Measured results and extensive computer simulation are presented to demonstrate the validity of the concept and the performance of the designed filters.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2003.821923","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1266901","","Resonator filters;Couplings;Filtering theory;Manufacturing;Microwave filters;Poles and zeros;Attenuation;Frequency;Computer simulation;Insertion loss","microwave filters;resonator filters;elliptic filters;equalisers;design engineering;poles and zeros","modular design building blocks;elliptic filters;self-equalized filters;pseudoelliptic filters;transmission zeros;imaginary axis;real axis;linear phase response;attenuation poles;coupling coefficient;extended doublet structure;complex plane;complex s-plane;coupling coefficients;waveguide structures;resonator filter types;higher order filters;filter order;frequency independent coupling coefficients;computer simulation;designed filters","","82","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A dynamic foveation filter then blurs every frame, increasingly with distance from salient locations. Sixty-three variants of the algorithm (varying number and shape of virtual foveas, maximum blur, and saliency competition) are evaluated against an outdoor video scene, using MPEG-1 and constant-quality MPEG-4 (DivX) encoding. Additional compression radios of 1.1 to 8.5 are achieved by foveation. Two variants of the algorithm are validated against eye fixations recorded from four to six human observers on a heterogeneous collection of 50 video clips (over 45 000 frames in total). Significantly higher overlap than expected by chance is found between human and algorithmic foveations. With both variants, foveated clips are, on average, approximately half the size of unfoveated clips, for both MPEG-1 and MPEG-4.

This method predicts the maximum likely voltage drop accounting for consumer diversity. However, this approach does not take into account the stochastic nature of the demand and is inconsistent with international power quality standards. We present a Monte Carlo simulation model of consumer demand taking into account the statistical spread of demand in each half hour using data sampled from a gamma distribution. The parameters of the gamma distribution are based on data metered at a number of residential properties fed by one transformer. The simulated demand is corrected for temperature and total consumption. The simulated profiles at the residential properties are aggregated and the simulated maximum demand is compared with actual maximum demand at a given transformer and an entire distribution network showing good agreement in both cases.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2004.826800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1318709","","Stochastic processes;Voltage;Home appliances;Temperature;Power quality;Power distribution;Electrical equipment industry;Electricity supply industry;Impedance","Monte Carlo methods;electricity supply industry;distribution networks;gamma distribution","Monte Carlo simulation;residential electricity demand;power distribution networks;after diversity maximum demand;low voltage electricity networks;consumer diversity","","59","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper describes the system design and evaluates several character extraction methods. Automatic text recognition from natural images receives a growing attention because of potential applications in image retrieval, robotics and intelligent transport system. Camera-based document analysis becomes a real possibility with the increasing resolution and availability of digital cameras. However, in the case of a blind person, finding the text region is the first important problem that must be addressed, because it cannot be assumed that the acquired image contains only characters. At first, our system tries to find in the image areas with small characters. Then it zooms into the found areas to retake higher resolution images necessary for character recognition. In the present paper, we propose four character-extraction methods based on connected components. We tested the effectiveness of our methods on the ICDAR 2003 Robust Reading Competition data. The performance of the different methods depends on character size. In the data, bigger characters are more prevalent and the most effective extraction method proves to be the sequence: Sobel edge detection, Otsu binarization, connected component extraction and rule-based connected component filtering.","1051-4651","0-7695-2128-2","10.1109/ICPR.2004.1334351","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1334351","","Layout;Intelligent robots;Data mining;System analysis and design;Text recognition;Image retrieval;Robotics and automation;Intelligent systems;Text analysis;Availability","handicapped aids;natural scenes;feature extraction;image retrieval;document image processing;edge detection;character recognition;robots","text detection;natural scene images;visually impaired persons assistance;character extraction methods;automatic text recognition;image retrieval;robotics;intelligent transport system;camera-based document analysis;digital cameras;character recognition;ICDAR 2003 Robust Reading Competition data;Sobel edge detection;Otsu binarization;connected component extraction;rule-based connected component filtering","","102","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The cross-coupled MOS pair contributes additional conductance and results in a higher maximum attainable oscillation frequency and better negative resistance characteristics as compared to the other topologies at high frequencies. These properties combined with its small effective capacitance enable low-power low-noise high-frequency VCO implementations.

The resulting 1.8-V ADC in 0.18-/spl mu/m CMOS achieves a conversion rate exceeding 1.6 GSample/s, since the amplifier device sizes can be minimized to maximize speed without the restriction of device matching. At 1.6 GS/s, the ADC achieves 0.15 LSB DNL, 0.35 LSB INL, 7.6 effective number of bits (ENOBs) at 100 MHz input, and 7.26 ENOB at Nyquist. At this speed, current consumption from a single 1.8-V supply is 245 mA analog, 185 mA digital, and 90 mA for the LVDS drivers. The ac performance is approximately 1.5 ENOBs higher compared to the same circuit with calibration disabled. The use of best design practices to optimize the ADC linearity prior to introducing calibration resulted in this small required dynamic calibration range, simplifying the calibrator circuitry and resulting in stable continuous performance over time without recalibration.

Knowledge transfer implies a broader, more inclusive construct that is directed more toward understanding the ""whys"" for change. In contrast, technology transfer is a narrower and more targeted construct that usually embodies certain tools for changing the environment. Grounding our work in the 7-S framework, we examine the role of key organizational factors in facilitating knowledge transfer and technology transfer activities. Survey data for this study were collected from 189 industrial firms representing 21 different industrial sectors. Results show that there are differences in the types of firm structures, cultures and university policies for intellectual property rights (IPR), patent ownership, and licensing that facilitated knowledge transfer activities compared to those that facilitated technology transfer activities. Specifically, firms with more mechanistic structures and more stable direction-oriented cultures were associated with higher levels of knowledge transfer. Conversely, firms with more organic structures, more flexible change-oriented cultures, and more customized university policies for IPR, patent ownership, and licensing were associated with higher levels of technology transfer. The firm's trust in its university research center partner was equally important for both activities. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for future research and management practice.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2003.822461","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1266854","","Technology transfer","technology transfer;knowledge management;industrial engineering;innovation management;technology management;regression analysis","knowledge transfer activities;technology transfer activities;organizational factors;7-S framework;survey data;industrial firms;industrial sectors;firm structures;university policy;intellectual property rights;patent ownership;licensing;mechanistic structures;stable direction-oriented cultures;organic structures;flexible change-oriented cultures;university research center partner","","74","","65","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the major problem of the SCB is that it lacks robustness in the presence of array steering vector errors. In this paper, we will first provide a complete analysis of a norm constrained Capon beamforming (NCCB) approach, which uses a norm constraint on the weight vector to improve the robustness against array steering vector errors and noise. Our analysis of NCCB is thorough and sheds more light on the choice of the norm constraint than what was commonly known. We also provide a natural extension of the SCB, which has been obtained via covariance matrix fitting, to the case of uncertain steering vectors by enforcing a double constraint on the array steering vector, viz. a constant norm constraint and a spherical uncertainty set constraint, which we refer to as the doubly constrained robust Capon beamformer (DCRCB). NCCB and DCRCB can both be efficiently computed at a comparable cost with that of the SCB. Performance comparisons of NCCB, DCRCB, and several other adaptive beamformers via a number of numerical examples are also presented.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2004.831998","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1323250","","Array signal processing;Interference constraints;Covariance matrix;Adaptive arrays;Signal resolution;Vectors;Noise robustness;Uncertainty;Costs;Acoustic signal processing","interference suppression;covariance matrices;array signal processing;signal resolution","DCRCB;doubly constrained robust Capon beamforming;SCB;standard Capon beamforming;signal resolution;interference rejection capability;data-independent beamformer;array steering vector;norm constrained Capon beamforming;NCCB;covariance matrix fitting;spherical uncertainty set constraint","","248","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Grossglauser and Tse (2001) showed that when nodes are mobile it is possible to have a constant or /spl otimes/(1) throughput scaling per source-destination pair. The focus of this paper is on characterizing the delay and determining the throughput-delay trade-off in such fixed and mobile ad hoc networks. For the Gupta-Kumar fixed network model, we show that the optimal throughput-delay trade-off is given by D(n) = /spl otimes/(nT(n)), where T(n) and D(n) are the throughput and delay respectively. For the Grossglauser-Tse mobile network model, we show that the delay scales as /spl otimes/(n/sup 1/2//v(n)), where v(n) is the velocity of the mobile nodes. We then describe a scheme that achieves the optimal order of delay for any given throughput. The scheme varies (i) the number of hops, (ii) the transmission range and (iii) the degree of node mobility to achieve the optimal throughput-delay trade-off. The scheme produces a range of models that capture the Gupta-Kumar model at one extreme and the Grossglauser-Tse model at the other. In the course of our work, we recover previous results of Gupta and Kumar, and Grossglauser and Tse using simpler techniques, which might be of a separate interest.","0743-166X","0-7803-8355-9","10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354518","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1354518","","Intelligent networks;Wireless networks;Throughput;Delay;Interference;Network topology;Wireless sensor networks;Stochastic processes;Queueing analysis;Information theory","delays;mobile radio;ad hoc networks","throughput-delay trade-off;random network model;source-destination pair;mobile ad hoc wireless networks;Grossglauser-Tse network model","","286","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The method is specifically designed for types of noise with uncorrelated fluctuations. Such signal fluctuations generally originate in the physical processes of imaging rather than in the tissue textures. Various types of noise (e.g., photon, electronics, and quantization) often contribute to degrade medical images; the overall noise is generally assumed to be additive with a zero-mean, constant-variance Gaussian distribution. However, statistical analysis suggests that the noise variance could be better modeled by a nonlinear function of the image intensity depending on external parameters related to the image acquisition protocol. We present a method to extract the relationship between an image intensity and the noise variance and to evaluate the corresponding parameters.

BLAKE","Microsoft Res., Cambridge, UK; NA; NA","Proceedings of the IEEE","","2004","92","3","495","513","The effectiveness of probabilistic tracking of objects in image sequences has been revolutionized by the development of particle filtering. Whereas Kalman filters are restricted to Gaussian distributions, particle filters can propagate more general distributions, albeit only approximately. This is of particular benefit in visual tracking because of the inherent ambiguity of the visual world that stems from its richness and complexity. One important advantage of the particle filtering framework is that it allows the information from different measurement sources to be fused in a principled manner. Although this fact has been acknowledged before, it has not been fully exploited within a visual tracking context. Here we introduce generic importance sampling mechanisms for data fusion and discuss them for fusing color with either stereo sound, for teleconferencing, or with motion, for surveillance with a still camera. We show how each of the three cues can be modeled by an appropriate data likelihood function, and how the intermittent cues (sound or motion) are best handled by generating proposal distributions from their likelihood functions. Finally, the effective fusion of the cues by particle filtering is demonstrated on real teleconference and surveillance data.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2003.823147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1271403","","Particle tracking;Teleconferencing;Surveillance;Image sequences;Gaussian distribution;Particle filters;Information filtering;Information filters;Particle measurements;Monte Carlo methods","sensor fusion;filtering theory;Kalman filters;Gaussian distribution;teleconferencing;video cameras","data fusion;visual tracking;probabilistic tracking;particle filtering;Kalman filters;Gaussian distributions;inherent ambiguity;measurement sources;fusing color;stereo sound;teleconferencing;camera","","348","","59","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents a novel approach of path planning. First the MAKLINK graph is built to describe the working space of the mobile robot; then the Dijkstra algorithm is used to obtain the shortest path from the start point to the goal point in the graph, finally the particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted to get the optimal path. Aiming at the shortcoming of the PSO algorithm, that is, easily plunging into the local minimum, this paper puts forward an advanced PSO algorithm with the mutation operator. By adding a mutation operator to the algorithm, it can not only escape the attraction of the local minimum in the later convergence phase, but also maintain the characteristic of fast speed in the early phase. The results of the simulation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which can meet the real-time requests of the mobile robot's navigation.","","0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382219","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382219","","Path planning;Mobile robots;Particle swarm optimization;Genetic mutations;Space technology;Navigation;Computer science;Convergence;Evolutionary computation;Birds","path planning;mobile robots;optimisation;convergence","path planning;mobile robot navigation;particle swarm optimization;mutation operator;MAKLINK graph;Dijkstra algorithm","","34","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The spatial colocation rule problem is different from the association rule problem since there is no natural notion of transactions in spatial data sets which are embedded in continuous geographic space. We provide a transaction-free approach to mine colocation patterns by using the concept of proximity neighborhood. A new interest measure, a participation index, is also proposed for spatial colocation patterns. The participation index is used as the measure of prevalence of a colocation for two reasons. First, this measure is closely related to the cross-K function, which is often used as a statistical measure of interaction among pairs of spatial features. Second, it also possesses an antimonotone property which can be exploited for computational efficiency. Furthermore, we design an algorithm to discover colocation patterns. This algorithm includes a novel multiresolution pruning technique.

Both factors are essential quantities for the accurate prediction of the flux distribution within the machine and of the machine torque. Therefore, they are desired for the purpose of machine design and optimization. In order to evaluate the validity of the proposed models, the finite-element method (FEM) analysis is used. The results show that the errors between the FEM results and analytical predictions are less than 7% for the nonsaturated tooth flux and less than 17% for the saturated case.

The behavior of real ants has inspired the development of the ACS algorithm, an improved version of the ant system (AS) algorithm, which reproduces the technique used by ants to construct their food recollection routes from their nest, and where a set of artificial ants cooperate to find the best solution through the interchange of the information contained in the pheromone deposits of the different trajectories. This metaheuristic approach has proven to be very robust when applied to global optimization problems of a combinatorial nature, such as the traveling salesman and the quadratic assignment problem, and is favorably compared to other solution approaches such as genetic algorithms (GAs) and simulated annealing techniques. In this work, the ACS methodology is coupled with a conventional distribution system load-flow algorithm and adapted to solve the primary distribution system planning problem. The application of the proposed methodology to two real cases is presented: a 34.5-kV system with 23 nodes from the oil industry and a more complex 10-kV electrical distribution system with 201 nodes that feeds an urban area. The performance of the proposed approach outstands positively when compared to GAs, obtaining improved results with significant reductions in the solution time.

It is shown that the speed based bang-bang control (BBC) is unable to use the entire decelerating area in maintaining stability. The proposed control strategy improves the stability limit first by maximizing the decelerating area and then fully utilizing it in counterbalancing the accelerating area. This requires to continue the operation of shunt FACTS devices at full capacitive rating until the machine speed reaches a reasonable negative value during the first return journey. Afterwards, the control can be switched to continuous type to improve system damping in subsequent swings. The proposed control strategy is then applied to both static var compensator and static synchronous compensators placed in a single machine infinite bus system. The same control strategy is also used for some faults in a multimachine system. In both the systems, it is found that the proposed control can provide significantly higher stability limit than that of the BBC.

A sleeve-like balun choke placed on the feed cable close to the antenna under test (AUT) prevents surface currents of the AUT from propagating onto the outer shield of the RF feed cable. Therefore, measurement results with the balun correspond well to those of an isolated AUT, much better than without any measures against cable effects. The balun can typically be used at a 10% relative bandwidth. A dual-frequency balun minimizes the cable-related effects at two separate frequency bands. This is useful in the measurements of dual-frequency antennas. The results of both simulations and measurements for a dual-band balun are presented in this paper, proving the usefulness of the proposed balun and its advantages over alternative means to decrease the cable-related effects.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2004.823299","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1284884","","Impedance matching;Inductors;Antenna measurements;Cable shielding;Radio frequency;Antenna feeds;Antennas and propagation;Frequency measurement;Mobile antennas;Mobile communication","baluns;inductors;antenna radiation patterns;antenna testing;mobile antennas;mobile radio;dipole antennas;multifrequency antennas","balun chokes;small-antenna radiation measurements;free-space radiation characteristics;small antennas;radio frequency;sleeve-like balun choke;antenna under test;surface current prevention;RF feed cable;isolated AUT;cable-related effect minimization;dual-frequency antennas;dual-band balun;cable-related effects;dual-frequency balun choke;RF cable;far-field measurements;near-field measurements;perturbed radiation pattern;small-antenna measurements","","75","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Team members from different functional departments of the company interact in every phase of development tasks to design the products and processes concurrently. To ensure a successful multifunctional team, it is important to understand the characteristics of team members. Three fundamental descriptors of team members are developed in this research. The first is to represent the multifunctional knowledge of team members due to the need of concurrent engineering. Second, to build a successful project team, teamwork capability of team members is needed by taking their experience, communication skills, and flexibility in job assignment into account. Multifunctional knowledge and teamwork capability ratings are captured from each member using analytic hierarchy process. Third, since the team members work closely, their collegiality directly affects team performance, regardless of their knowledge. Thus, the working relationship model is developed to provide such a metric. Personality profiling using Myers-Briggs type indicator serves as the basis of assessing each team member's abilities to work with others. Finally, we complete this paper by providing a step-by-step procedure with an example for selecting the best multifunctional team using the three ratings.

An input-side pruning technique, proposed previously by the authors, is also incorporated into the constructive learning process to reduce the network size without sacrificing the performance of the resulting network. The proposed technique is applied to a database consisting of images of 60 men, each having five facial expression images (neutral, smile, anger, sadness, and surprise). Images of 40 men are used for network training, and the remaining images of 20 men are used for generalization and testing. Confusion matrices calculated in both network training and generalization for four facial expressions (smile, anger, sadness, and surprise) are used to evaluate the performance of the trained network. It is demonstrated that the best recognition rates are 100% and 93.75% (without rejection), for the training and generalizing images, respectively. Furthermore, the input-side weights of the constructed network are reduced by approximately 30% using our pruning method. In comparison with the fixed structure back propagation-based recognition methods in the literature, the proposed technique constructs one-hidden-layer feedforward neural network with fewer number of hidden units and weights, while simultaneously provide improved generalization and recognition performance capabilities.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2004.825930","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1298906","","Face recognition;Neural networks;Feedforward neural networks;Image recognition;Discrete cosine transforms;Face detection;Computer vision;Detectors;Image databases;Testing","gesture recognition;visual databases;face recognition;feedforward neural nets;generalisation (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence);discrete cosine transforms","constructive neural networks;facial recognition;generalization;pruning strategies;two-dimensional discrete cosine transform;facial expression recognition;feedforward neural networks;feature detector;constructive learning","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Face;Facial Expression;Feedback;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Male;Neural Networks (Computer);Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photography;Posture;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","119","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A set of design criteria and a complete design procedure of the sliding-control laws are derived from small-signal analysis and large-signal considerations.

Drucker","Dept. of Organismic & Evolutionary Biol., Harvard Univ., Cambridge, MA, USA; NA","IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","","2004","29","3","556","571","Over the past 520 million years, the process of evolution has produced a diversity of nearly 25000 species of fish. This diversity includes thousands of different fin designs which are largely the product of natural selection for locomotor performance. Fish fins can be grouped into two major categories: median and paired fins. Fins are typically supported at their base by a series of segmentally arranged bony or cartilaginous elements, and fish have extensive muscular control over fin conformation. Recent experimental hydrodynamic investigation of fish fin function in a diversity of freely swimming fish (including sharks, sturgeon, trout, sunfish, and surfperch) has demonstrated the role of fins in propulsion and maneuvering. Fish pectoral fins generate either separate or linked vortex rings during propulsion, and the lateral forces generated by pectoral fins are of similar magnitudes to thrust force during slow swimming. Yawing maneuvers involve differentiation of hydrodynamic function between left and right fins via vortex ring reorientation. Low-aspect ratio pectoral fins in sharks function to alter body pitch and induce vertical maneuvers through conformational changes of the fin trailing edge. The dorsal fin of fish displays a diversity of hydrodynamic function, from a discrete thrust-generating propulsor acting independently from the body, to a stabilizer generating only side forces. Dorsal fins play an active role in generating off-axis forces during maneuvering. Locomotor efficiency may be enhanced when the caudal fin intercepts the dorsal fin wake. The caudal fin of fish moves in a complex three-dimensional manner and evidence for thrust vectoring of caudal fin forces is presented for sturgeon which appear to have active control of the angle of vortices shed from the tail. Fish are designed to be unstable and are constantly using their control surfaces to generate opposing and balancing forces in addition to thrust. Lessons from fish for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) design include: 1) location of multiple control surfaces distributed widely about the center of mass, 2) design of control surfaces that have a high degree of three-dimensional motion through a flexible articulation with the body, 3) the ability to modulate fin surface conformation, and 4) the simultaneous use of numerous control surfaces including locating some fin elements in the downstream wake generated by other fins. The ability to manufacture an AUV that takes advantage of these design features is currently limited by the nature of available materials and mechanical drive trains. But future developments in polymer artificial muscle technology will provide a new approach to propulsor design that will permit construction of biomimetic propulsors with conformational and articulational flexibility similar to that of fish fins.","1558-1691","","10.1109/JOE.2004.833219","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1353410","Fin;fish;hydrodynamics;locomotion;particle image velocimetry","Hydrodynamics;Marine animals;Surface morphology;Motion control;Weight control;Propulsion;Force control;Displays;Tail;Underwater vehicles","hydrodynamics;biomechanics;underwater vehicles;zoology;control system synthesis;motion control;biocontrol","morphology;experimental hydrodynamics;fish fin control surfaces;median fins;paired fins;fish pectoral fins;yawing maneuvers;vortex ring reorientation;vertical maneuvers;dorsal fin;locomotor efficiency;caudal fin;autonomous underwater vehicle;multiple control surfaces;fin surface conformation;polymer artificial muscle technology;particle image velocimetry","","170","","100","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, most approaches to correlation concentrate on just a few components of the process, providing formalisms and techniques that address only specific correlation issues. This paper presents a general correlation model that includes a comprehensive set of components and a framework based on this model. A tool using the framework has been applied to a number of well-known intrusion detection data sets to identify how each component contributes to the overall goals of correlation.

The dual-loop feedback is implemented in the form of transformer current-feedback and inductive series feedback (emitter degeneration). The current-feedback transformer is also used to neutralize the base-collector capacitance (C/sub bc/), by combining it with a properly dimensioned shunt admittance at the collector output. The result is a single-transistor unilateral-gain amplifier with high isolation and good stability, eliminating the need for a cascode stage and thus enableing the use of a lower dc-supply voltage. For the complete LNA, simple design equations are derived for the unilateralization, noise, and impedance matching requirements. Finally, second-harmonic tuning at the source improves the linearity without compromising the simultaneous noise and impedance match. To verify the presented theory, a 900-MHz hybrid Si BJT LNA has been implemented, which achieves 1.3-dB noise figure, 15-dB gain, -55dB isolation, and +10dBm IIP3 using a conventional double poly transistor, consuming I/sub C/=2.5 mA at V/sub CE/=1.5 V.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2004.833759","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337004","","Feedback;Low-noise amplifiers;Impedance matching;Capacitance;Admittance;Stability;Voltage;Equations;Linearity;Noise figure","radiofrequency amplifiers;feedback amplifiers;radiofrequency integrated circuits;hybrid integrated circuits;bipolar transistors;impedance matching;semiconductor materials;silicon","unilateral dual-loop feedback;low-noise amplifiers;IIP3 match;nonenergetic dual-loop feedback;impedance matching;inductive series feedback;emitter degeneration;current-feedback transformer;base-collector capacitance;shunt admittance;collector output;single-transistor amplifier;cascode stage;DC supply voltage;noise matching;second-harmonic tuning;hybrid Si BJT LNA;double polytransistor;low noise amplifier;negative feedback amplifier;radio-frequency integrated circuit design;Si-SiGe analog circuit design;third-order intermodulation distortion;IM3;unilateral-gain amplifier;1.3 dB;15 dB;2.5 mA;1 to 5 V","","28","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Eng., Univ. of Padova, Italy; NA","IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","","2004","51","4","776","784","In this paper, a novel technique for the direct torque control (DTC) of an induction motor is proposed, which overcomes the trouble of high torque ripple afflicting the conventional DTC technique. With the novel technique, the inverter voltage vector selected from the switching table is applied for the time interval needed by the torque to reach the upper (or the lower) limit of the band, where the time interval is calculated from a suitable modeling of the torque dynamics. By this approach, the control system emulates the operation of a torque hysteresis controller of analog type since the application time of the inverter voltage vector is dictated by the allowed torque excursion and not by the sampling period. It is shown by experimental results that the technique yields a considerable reduction of the torque ripple. A further and ultimate reduction is obtained by compensating for the delay inherent in the discrete-time operation of the control system. The outcome is that the torque ripple of the motor is constrained within the hysteresis band of the torque controller, for a band of customary value. An ancillary merit of the technique is the almost full elimination of the average torque error inherent in the conventional technique. If the hysteresis band is shrunk, the torque ripple is bound to swing out the band limits. Under this circumstance, an extension of the technique is developed, which helps keep the torque ripple at minimum. To assess the characteristics of the proposed DTC technique, the following quantities: average torque error, rms value of the torque ripple, and inverter switching frequency are measured for different stator flux angular speeds and hysteresis bands of the torque and flux controllers. As a comparison, the same quantities are given for the conventional DTC technique.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2004.831722","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1318738","","Torque control;Induction motors;Inverters;Control systems;Voltage control;Sampling methods;Delay;Hysteresis motors;Error correction;Switching frequency","induction motor drives;machine control;torque control;switching convertors;invertors;magnetic hysteresis;control systems;frequency measurement;stators","band-constrained technique;direct torque control;induction motor drives;torque ripple;inverter voltage vector;torque dynamics;control system;torque hysteresis controller;sampling period;discrete-time operation;torque error;inverter switching frequency;stator flux;angular speed;hysteresis bands;flux controllers","","63","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We show that with these partial measurements the Kalman filter and its error covariance matrix iteration become stochastic, since they now depend on the random packet arrivals of the sensor measurements, which can be lost or delayed when transmitted over a communication network. The communication network needs to provide a sufficient throughput for each of the sensor measurements in order to guarantee the stability of the Kalman filter, where the throughput captures the rate of the sensor measurements correctly received. We investigate the statistical convergence properties of the error covariance matrix iteration as a function of the throughput of the sensor measurements. A throughput region that guarantees the convergence of the error covariance matrix is found by solving a feasibility problem of a linear matrix inequality. We also find an unstable throughput region such that the state estimation error of the Kalman filter is unbounded. The expected error covariance matrix is bounded both from above and from below. The results are illustrated with some simple numerical examples.","0191-2216","0-7803-8682-5","10.1109/CDC.2004.1429408","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1429408","","Kalman filters;Filtering;Throughput;Loss measurement;Covariance matrix;Communication networks;Convergence;Stochastic processes;Stability;Linear matrix inequalities","convergence of numerical methods;Kalman filters;filtering theory;iterative methods;covariance matrices;error analysis;linear matrix inequalities;distributed control;wireless sensor networks","Kalman filtering;partial observation losses;Kalman filter updates;error covariance matrix iteration;random packet arrivals;sensor measurements;communication network;stability;statistical convergence properties;throughput;linear matrix inequality;state estimation error","","88","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we propose a new approach to retrieve aerosol properties over surfaces such as arid, semiarid, and urban areas, where the surface reflectance is usually very bright in the red part of visible spectrum and in the near infrared, but is much darker in the blue spectral region (i.e., wavelength <500 nm). In order to infer atmospheric properties from these data, a global surface reflectance database of 0.1/spl deg/ latitude by 0.1/spl deg/ longitude resolution was constructed over bright surfaces for visible wavelengths using the minimum reflectivity technique (e.g., finding the clearest scene during each season for a given location). The aerosol optical thickness and aerosol type are then determined simultaneously in the algorithm using lookup tables to match the satellite observed spectral radiances. Examples of aerosol optical thickness derived using this algorithm over the Sahara Desert and Arabian Peninsula reveal various dust sources, which are important contributors to airborne dust transported over long distances. Comparisons of the satellite inferred aerosol optical thickness and the values from ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sun/sky radiometer measurements indicate good agreement (i.e., within 30%) over the sites in Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. This new algorithm, when applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Sea-viewing Wide Field of view Sensor (SeaWiFS), and Global Imager (GLI) satellite data, will provide high spatial resolution (/spl sim/1 km) global information of aerosol optical thickness over bright surfaces on a daily basis.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.824067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1273587","","Aerosols;Optical surface waves;Sea surface;Optical sensors;Satellite broadcasting;Surface waves;Reflectivity;MODIS;Remote sensing;Land surface","aerosols;remote sensing by radar;satellite tracking;spaceborne radar;image sensors;image resolution;image retrieval","bright-reflecting source regions;satellite remote sensing;aerosol properties retrieval;arid area;semiarid area;urban area;visible spectrum;near infrared spectrum;blue spectral region;global surface reflectance database;visible wavelengths;minimum reflectivity technique;aerosol type;spectral radiances;Sahara Desert;Arabian Peninsula;dust sources;airborne dust;satellite inferred aerosol optical thickness;ground-based aerosol robotic network;sun-sky radiometer;Nigeria;Saudi Arabia;moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer;sea-viewing wide field of view sensor;global imager satellite data;spatial resolution","","759","","39","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Registration based on intensity values usually requires optimization of some similarity metric between the images. Local optimization techniques frequently fail because functions of these metrics with respect to transformation parameters are generally nonconvex and irregular and, therefore, global methods are often required. In this paper, a new evolutionary approach, particle swarm optimization, is adapted for single-slice 3D-to-3D biomedical image registration. A new hybrid particle swarm technique is proposed that incorporates initial user guidance. Multimodal registrations with initial orientations far from the ground truth were performed on three volumes from different modalities. Results of optimizing the normalized mutual information similarity metric were compared with various evolutionary strategies. The hybrid particle swarm technique produced more accurate registrations than the evolutionary strategies in many cases, with comparable convergence. These results demonstrate that particle swarm approaches, along with evolutionary techniques and local methods, are useful in image registration, and emphasize the need for hybrid approaches for difficult registration problems.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2004.826068","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1304849","","Biomedical imaging;Particle swarm optimization;Magnetic resonance imaging;Medical treatment;Ultrasonic imaging;Image registration;Biomedical computing;Computed tomography;Positron emission tomography;Computer science","image registration;evolutionary computation;optimisation;multi-agent systems;medical image processing;trees (mathematics)","multimodal biomedical image registration;particle swarm optimization;initial user guidance;similarity metric optimisation;single-slice 3D to 3D biomedical image registration;convergence","","238","","42","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The prediction is done on the basis of the current traffic situation in combination with historical data. We argue that, for our purposes, the current traffic situation of a section of a freeway is well summarized by the current status travel time. This is the travel time that would result if one were to depart immediately and no significant changes in traffic would occur. This current status travel time can be estimated from single- or double-loop detectors, video data, probe vehicles, or any other means. Our prediction method arises from the empirical observation that there exists a linear relationship between any future travel time and the current status travel time. The slope and intercept of this relationship may change subject to the time of day and the time until departure, but linearity persists. This observation leads to a prediction scheme by means of linear regression with time-varying coefficients.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2004.833765","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1331390","","Traffic control;Transportation;Prediction methods;Linear regression;Measurement;Internet;Vehicle detection;Detectors;Probes;Vehicles","regression analysis;time-varying systems;automated highways","freeways travel time prediction;linear regression;time-varying coefficients;intelligent transportation systems","","160","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Military Communications Conference, 2004.","","2004","2","","711","716 Vol. 2","Increasing emphasis on reliable data transmission for homeland security and network-centric operations makes secure communications a critical component of national security. While fiber optic cables are immune to typical EMI/RFI issues, it is possible to intercept an optical signal successfully if risk areas are not understood and if detection and/or prevention mechanisms are not actively integrated into network management practices. There are several ways to 'tap' into an optical fiber, including fiber bending, splitting, evanescent coupling, scattering, and V-grooves. Many of these techniques require altering the physical characteristics of the fiber with a significant risk of damaging the fiber and having the optical intercept detected by the end user. Of all the techniques, the bent fiber tap is the most easily deployed with minimal risk of damage or detection. The paper quantifies the bend loss required to tap a signal propagating in a single mode fiber and analyzes the properties of the bend that could be used to detect that a tap is occurring. Understanding the mechanisms used for fiber tapping provides greater insight into ways of actively detecting unauthorized optical intercepts or compromised network security. Enhanced monitoring techniques enable the detection and localization of fiber taps. Monitoring techniques are reviewed with detailed analysis of each method's effectiveness in detecting bent fiber taps and their cost-effectiveness for integration into optical networks.","","0-7803-8847-X","10.1109/MILCOM.2004.1494884","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1494884","","Optical fiber networks;Optical scattering;Optical fibers;Optical surface waves;National security;Optical fiber cables;Optical detectors;Monitoring;Data security;Optical fiber communication","telecommunication security;optical fibre networks;data communication;security of data","optical network security;fiber tapping mechanisms;fiber tapping detection;fiber tapping prevention;reliable data transmission;secure communications;national security;network management;fiber bending;fiber splitting;evanescent coupling;scattering;V-grooves;bent fiber tap;single mode fiber;optical intercepts;monitoring techniques","","33","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The all-pass filter can give a desired phase shift and no magnitude reduction, unlike conventional low-or high-pass filters. Based on this positive-sequence component, the source phase angle and the reference voltage for compensation are derived. This method is easier to implement and to tune controller gains.

The developed microreactor in combination with a micro fuel cell is proposed as an alternative to conventional portable sources of electricity such as batteries due to its ability to provide an uninterrupted supply of electricity as long as a supply of methanol and water can be provided. The microreformer-fuel cell combination has the advantage of not requiring the tedious recharging cycles needed by conventional rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. It also offers significantly higher energy storage densities, which translates into less frequent ""recharging"" through the refilling of methanol fuel. The microreactor consists of a network of catalyst-packed parallel microchannels of depths ranging from 200 to 400 /spl mu/m with a catalyst particle filter near the outlet fabricated using photolithography and deep-reactive ion etching (DRIE) on a silicon substrate. Issues related to microchannel and filter capping, on-chip heating and temperature sensing, introduction and trapping of catalyst particles in the microchannels, flow distribution, microfluidic interfacing, and thermal insulation have been addressed.

Some widely used approximations are based on the assumption that a lognormal sum is well approximated by a lognormal random variable. Here, a new paradigm for approximating lognormal sum distributions is presented. A linearizing transform is used with a linear minimax approximation to determine an optimal lognormal approximation to a lognormal sum distribution. The accuracies of the new method are quantitatively compared to the accuracies of some well-known approximations. In some practical cases, the optimal lognormal approximation is several orders of magnitude more accurate than previous approximations.

We derive the optimal balance between the amount of Fourier and wavelet regularization by optimizing an approximate mean-squared error (MSE) metric and find that signals with more economical wavelet representations require less Fourier shrinkage. ForWaRD is applicable to all ill-conditioned deconvolution problems, unlike the purely wavelet-based wavelet-vaguelette deconvolution (WVD); moreover, its estimate features minimal ringing, unlike the purely Fourier-based Wiener deconvolution. Even in problems for which the WVD was designed, we prove that ForWaRD's MSE decays with the optimal WVD rate as the number of samples increases. Further, we demonstrate that over a wide range of practical sample-lengths, ForWaRD improves on WVD's performance.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2003.821103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1261329","","Deconvolution;Colored noise;Additive white noise;AWGN;Wavelet domain;Convolution;Cameras;Educational institutions;Degradation;Gaussian noise","deconvolution;wavelet transforms;mean square error methods;image representation;stochastic processes;Fourier transforms","Fourier-wavelet regularized deconvolution;noise regularization;scalar shrinkage;ill-conditioned system;mean square error;wavelet vaguelette deconvolution;Weiner distribution;signal processing;image processing;deblurring;restoration","","283","","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The image information drives the process of extending and pruning the graph, and determines the best hypothesis to explain the video. While the image-based object detection makes a local decision, the tracking process confirms and validates the detection through time, therefore, it can be regarded as temporal detection which makes a global decision across time. The multiple object tracking method gives feedbacks which are predictions of object locations to the object detection module. Therefore, the method integrates object detection and tracking tightly.

The new discrete-time MIMO channel model includes the combined effects of the transmit filter, physical MIMO multipath channel fading, and receive filter, and it has the same sampling period as that of the MIMO receiver. This leads to very efficient simulation of physical continuous-time MIMO channels. A new method is also presented to efficiently generate the MIMO channel stochastic coefficients. The statistical accuracy of the discrete-time MIMO channel model is rigorously verified through theoretical analysis and extensive simulations in different conditions. The high computational efficiency of the discrete-time MIMO channel model is illustrated by comparing it to that of the continuous-time MIMO channel model.

Many key agreement schemes used in general networks, such as Diffie-Hellman and public-key based schemes, are not suitable for wireless sensor networks. Pre-distribution of secret keys for all pairs of nodes is not viable due to the large amount of memory used when the network size is large. Recently, a random key pre-distribution scheme and its improvements have been proposed. A common assumption made by these random key pre-distribution schemes is that no deployment knowledge is available. Noticing that in many practical scenarios, certain deployment knowledge may be available a priori, we propose a novel random key pre-distribution scheme that exploits deployment knowledge and avoids unnecessary key assignments. We show that the performance (including connectivity, memory usage, and network resilience against node capture) of sensor networks can he substantially improved with the use of our proposed scheme.

One is to detect the occurrence of a fault and the other is to distinguish between in-zone and out-of-zone faults. Furthermore, for discriminating between arcing and permanent faults, the proposed technique estimates the amplitude of arc voltage by least error squares method through the measured synchronized harmonic phasors caused by the nonlinear arc behavior. Then, the discrimination will be achieved by comparing the estimated amplitude of arc voltage to a given threshold value.

The structure is based on a Global History Buffer that holds the most recent miss addresses in FIFO order. Linked lists within this global history buffer connect addresses that have some common property, e.g. they were all generated by the same load instruction. The Global History Buffer can be used for implementing a number of previously proposed prefetch methods, as well as new ones. Prefetching with the Global History Buffer has two significant advantages over conventional table prefetching methods. First, the use of a FIFO history buffer can improve the accuracy of correlation prefetching by eliminating stale data from the table. Second, the Global History Buffer contains a more complete (and intact) picture of cache miss history, creating opportunities to design more effective prefetching methods. Global History Buffer prefetching can increase correlation prefetching performance by 20% and cut its memory traffic by 90%. Furthermore, the Global History Buffer can make correlations within a load’s address stream, which can increase stride prefetching performance by 6%. Collectively, the Global History Buffer prefetching methods perform as well or better than the conventional prefetching methods studied on 14 of 15 benchmarks.","1530-0897","0-7695-2053-7","10.1109/HPCA.2004.10030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1410068","","Prefetching;History;Delay;Cache memory;Microprocessors;Clocks;Computational modeling;Analytical models;Computer simulation;Microarchitecture","","","","128","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The cost of having defects on rolled steel is high because it takes more than 5000 KW-Hr to produce a ton of steel. Early detection of defects can reduce product damage and manufacturing cost. This paper describes a real-time visual inspection system that uses support vector machine to automatically learn complicated defect patterns.

Yet, a high quality AC output is required for grid interconnection under variable source conditions. Previously developed control strategies mainly focused on improvements under load variations, a DC input of relatively small ripples, etc. This paper proposed a closed-loop sinusoidal PWM control method with real-time waveform feedback techniques for a grid-connected buck-boost inverter. The control-to-output function was derived through steady state modeling based on the power balance condition, which provides an approach when the output cannot easily be characterized in a single-stage buck-boost inverter. The closed-loop control model was studied with a newly-invented single-stage buck-boost inverter circuit. Simulations verified the method provided fast dynamic response and robustness under large DC voltage variations, nonideal grid voltage, and component parametric uncertainties. The controlled inverter achieved a low-THD sinusoidal output with a small AC filter and without a DC link capacitor. Therefore, it is concluded that the proposed method can be a preferred choice for grid-connected buck-boost inverters in distributed generation systems.","0275-9306","0-7803-8399-0","10.1109/PESC.2004.1355070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1355070","","Pulse width modulation inverters;Distributed control;Voltage fluctuations;Wind energy;Integrated circuit interconnections;Load management;Feedback;Steady-state;Circuit simulation;Robustness","PWM invertors;closed loop systems;power conversion harmonics;harmonic distortion;DC-DC power convertors;dynamic response;distributed power generation;power supply quality;load regulation","sinusoidal pulse width modulation;closed-loop SPWM control;grid-connected buck-boost inverters;DC input voltage;wind energy system;AC output;load variations control;real-time waveform feedback techniques;steady state modeling;power balance condition;dynamic response;robustness;nonideal grid voltage;component parametric uncertainty;low-THD sinusoidal output;AC filter;distributed generation system","","14","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It can solve the size-and-weight problems of conventional transformer-based multipulse inverters and the component-counts problems of multilevel diode-clamp and flying-capacitor inverter. Phase-shift sinusoidal pulse width modulation (PS-SPWM) technique is employed to control the switching devices of each voltage-source inverter, as a result, the devices operate at a higher equivalent carrier frequency. In conclusion, the inverter has such advantages as: 1) reducing power loss because of transform-less design; 2) generating almost sinusoidal waveform voltage with high equivalent carrier frequency; 3) eliminating transformers of multipulse inverters used in the conventional STATCOM; 4) dynamic response fast; and 5) direct connection to power distribution system without any transformer.

In contrast the armature winding is represented by a current sheet close to the stator iron surface. Magnetic field results produced by the analytic equations have been compared with two-, and three-, dimensional finite element studies and found to produce results comparable to within 5%. In addition emf, flux and inductance measurements have been made on two generators and compared with both finite element and analytic results. The analytic model predicts the emf to within 5%.

It is shown that WiseMAC can provide a significantly lower power consumption for the same delay.","","0-7803-8623-X","10.1109/ISCC.2004.1358412","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1358412","","Media Access Protocol;Wireless application protocol;Downlink;Wireless sensor networks;Access protocols;Energy consumption;Delay;Energy efficiency;Sampling methods;Communication system traffic control","wireless sensor networks;access protocols","wiseMAC;ultra low power MAC protocol;wireless sensor network downlink infrastructure;energy efficiency;medium access control protocol;synchronized preamble sampling;power consumption","","169","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

SWATT does not need physical access to the device's memory, yet provides memory content attestation similar to TCG or NGSCB without requiring secure hardware. SWATT can detect any change in memory contents with high probability, thus detecting viruses, unexpected configuration settings, and Trojan Horses. To circumvent SWATT, we expect that an attacker needs to change the hardware to hide memory content changes.

In biopotential measurements, however, the admissible gain of amplification stages located before dc suppression is usually limited by electrode offset voltage, which can saturate amplifier outputs. The standard solution is to first convert the differential input voltage to a single-ended voltage and then implement any other required functions, such as dc suppression and dc level restoring. This approach, however, yields a limited CMRR and may result in a relatively large equivalent input noise. This paper describes a novel fully differential biopotential amplifier based on a fully differential dc-suppression circuit that does not rely on any matched passive components, yet provides large CMRR and fast recovery from dc level transients. The proposed solution is particularly convenient for low supply voltage systems. An example implementation, based on standard low-power op amps and a single 5-V power supply, accepts input offset voltages up to /spl plusmn/500 mV, yields a CMRR of 102dB at 50 Hz, and provides, in accordance with the AAMI EC38 standard, a reset behavior for recovering from overloads or artifacts.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2004.827931","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1315868","","Differential amplifiers;Voltage;Electrodes;Coupling circuits;Operational amplifiers;Impedance;Capacitors;Active circuits;Gain measurement;Circuit noise","bioelectric potentials;biomedical electrodes;differential amplifiers","differential biopotential amplifier;fully differential DC-suppression circuit;large differential gains;high common mode rejection ratio;electrode offset voltage;standard low-power op amps;single S-V power supply;5 V;102 dB;50 Hz","Amplifiers;Computer-Aided Design;Electrophysiology;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","43","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, the dynamic model of a flexible robot arm system with a tip mass is introduced. When the tip mass of the flexible robot arm is a rigid body, not only bending vibration but also torsional vibration are occurred. In this paper, the vibration states of the nonlinear system are assumed to he unmeasurable, i.e., only the actuator position can be acquired to feed into a suitable control system for stabilizing the vibration states indirectly. Then, an intelligent optimal control system is proposed to control the motor-mechanism coupling system for periodic motion. In the intelligent optimal control system a fuzzy neural network controller is used to learn a nonlinear function in the optimal control law, and a robust controller is designed to compensate the approximation error. Moreover, a simple adaptive algorithm is proposed to adjust the uncertain bound in the robust controller avoiding the chattering phenomena. The control laws of the intelligent optimal control system are derived in the sense of optimal control technique and Lyapunov stability analysis, so that system-tracking stability can be guaranteed in the closed-loop system.

The model is developed by relating physical spaces within the multiwinding transformer to the leakage inductances and the mutual couplings of the transformer. The model is currently being investigated for the following areas: leakage and cross-coupling effects in resonant and hard-switched converters, modelling of EMI parasitics and AC resistance components, and modelling of poly-phase transformers, coupled inductors, and machines. In this paper, the basic model is presented and validated. A high-power high-leakage three-winding transformer is first characterized on the bench using open-circuit and series-coupling tests. This test data set yields the transformer inductance matrix composed of self and mutual inductances. The elements of the matrix are then broken down into the leakage and mutual inductances between the three windings. The physical structure of the transformer is then examined, and the new transformer model is created based on this visual examination and the knowledge of leakage and mutual inductances. The inductance matrix is also used to generate two other models: the conventional T model, and the extended cantilever model. Excellent correlation is demonstrated between all three models, PSPICE simulations, and the experimental load tests using an inductive load.","0275-9306","0-7803-8399-0","10.1109/PESC.2004.1355391","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1355391","","Mutual coupling;Inductors;Magnetic resonance;Educational institutions;Switching converters;Automatic testing;SPICE;Inductance measurement;Power electronics;Geometry","transformer windings;resonant power convertors;switching convertors;magnetic leakage;power transformers;electromagnetic coupling;electromagnetic interference;inductance;matrix algebra;SPICE;power engineering computing","high-leakage multiwinding transformer;extended T model;leakage inductance;transformer coupling;cross-coupling effect;resonant converter;hard-switched converter;EMI parasitic;AC resistance component;coupled inductor;open-circuit test;series-coupling test;test data set;transformer inductance matrix;extended cantilever model;PSPICE simulation;inductive load","","14","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Disadvantageous effects caused by this are noticeable vibrations and high mechanical stresses due to torque oscillations. The oscillations can be damped using a control structure consisting of a nonlinear observer to estimate the torque in the gear and a controller, which computes a damping torque signal that is added to the driver's demand.

The amplitude of the P300 evoked potential is inversely proportional to the probability of infrequent or task-related stimulus. In existing P300 spellers, rows and columns of a matrix are intensified successively and randomly, resulting in a stimulus frequency of 1/N (N is the number of rows or columns of the matrix). We propose a new paradigm to display each single character randomly and individually (therefore reducing the stimulus frequency to 1/(N*N)). On-line experiments showed that this new speller significantly improved the performance. Specifically, the new speller can reduce character classification error rate by up to 80% or double the information transfer rate compared to the existing P300 spellers.","","0-7803-8665-5","10.1109/BIOCAS.2004.1454155","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1454155","","Brain computer interfaces;Frequency;Electroencephalography;Error analysis;Computer interfaces;Displays;Optimization methods;Principal component analysis;Muscles;Computer peripherals","electroencephalography;handicapped aids;bioelectric potentials;medical signal processing;signal classification","high performance P300 speller;brain-computer interface;P300 evoked potential;character classification error rate;information transfer rate","","31","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is organized as follows. First, a brief review of previously reported control studies and plant models is presented. Second, an experimentally validated plant model for The Johns Hopkins University Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicle (JHUROV) is reviewed. Third, the stability of linear proportional-derivative (PD) control and a family of fixed and adaptive model-based controllers is examined analytically and demonstrated with numerical simulations. Finally, we report results from experimental trials comparing the performance of these controllers over a wide range of operating conditions. The experimental results corroborate the analytical predictions that the model-based controllers outperform PD control over a wide range of operating conditions. The exactly linearizing model-based controller is outperformed by its nonexactly linearizing counterpart. The adaptive controllers are shown to provide reasonable online plant parameter estimates, as well as velocity and position tracking consistent with theoretical predictions-providing good velocity tracking and, with the appropriate parameter update law, position tracking. The effects of reference trajectory, ""bad"" model parameters, feedback gains, adaptation gains, and thruster saturation are experimentally evaluated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported comparative experimental study of this class of model-based controllers for underwater vehicles.","1558-1691","","10.1109/JOE.2003.823312","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1273571","","Vehicle dynamics;Robots;Underwater vehicles;PD control;Underwater tracking;Proportional control;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Trajectory;Remotely operated vehicles","underwater vehicles;remotely operated vehicles;motion control;tracking;adaptive control;position control","model-based dynamic positioning;underwater robotic vehicles;trajectory tracking problem;low-speed maneuvering;actuated underwater vehicles;remotely operated underwater vehicle;linear proportional-derivative control;control stability;adaptive controllers;numerical simulations;analytical predictions;velocity tracking;position tracking;feedback gains;adaptation gains;thruster saturation","","150","","65","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The ISFET has a floating-gate structure and uses the silicon nitride passivation layer as a pH-sensitive insulator. As fabricated, it has a large threshold voltage that is postulated to be caused by a trapped charge on the floating gate. Ultraviolet radiation and bulk-substrate biasing is used to permanently modify the threshold voltage so that the ISFET can be used in a battery-operated circuit. A novel post-processing method using a single layer of photoresist is used to define the sensing areas and to provide robust encapsulation for the chip.

Since partial discharges are considered to be the main cause of the reliability loss, new enamel insulations for magnet wires are being developed in order to withstand better stress amplification. The electrical characterization of these insulating materials is often carried out through aging tests which may provide estimation of life under different stress levels and conditions. However, deeper investigation of aging phenomena due to supply voltage waveforms is needed, especially regarding the relation between aging factors and stress conditions. This paper deals with this topic, showing experimental evidences of relation between partial discharge quantities (e.g., inception voltage, repetition frequency, amplitude) and electrical properties, associated with charge accumulation, which can be directly evaluated through space charge measurements. Characterization of insulating materials and comparison of materials candidate for application in power electronic waveform environment can be carried out resorting to the methodology proposed here.

It offers more freedom to deploy the transmitter and the receiver, e.g. in a way to enhance the signature of stealthy targets. Furthermore, the bi- or multistatic system can be realized without using expensive transmit/receive-modules. An additional feature of bistatic radar is that continuous wave signals can be used. A crucial problem associated with bi- and multistatic systems is the synchronisation of time and frequency at the transmitters and receivers for coherent signal processing and range measurement. Modern communications satellites and world wide accessible GPS signals allow to synchronise the time easily over a long period with a time difference of less than 1 ns. The required frequency stability depends on the baseline and may vary with application. Image generation with bistatic SAR systems requires a frequency coherence for at least the coherent integration time. For interferometric SAR systems this coherence has to be expanded over the whole processing time. The paper concentrates on the problem of time and frequency synchronisation between a bistatic transmitter and receiver pair. Possible solutions for attaining the requirements of bistatic radar systems are discussed.","","0-7803-8742-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2004.1370671","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1370671","","Bistatic radar;Frequency synchronization;Transmitters;Radar signal processing;Frequency measurement;Time measurement;Artificial satellites;Global Positioning System;Stability;Image generation","radar receivers;radar transmitters;synthetic aperture radar;Global Positioning System;radar tracking;target tracking;frequency stability;synchronisation;geophysical signal processing","time synchronisation;frequency synchronisation;bistatic SAR systems;bistatic radar systems;multistatic radar systems;bistatic transmitter;bistatic receiver;stealthy targets;continuous wave signals;coherent signal processing;modern communications satellites;GPS signals;frequency stability;frequency coherence;coherent integration time;interferometric SAR systems","","21","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed detector first uses an adaptive local curvature threshold instead of a single global threshold as in the original and enhanced CSS methods. Second, the angles of corner candidates are checked in a dynamic region of support for eliminating falsely detected corners.

The tradeoff of complexity versus performance associated with using strengthening ribs in the magnet cavities is discussed. The sensitivity of the mechanical design limitations to the rotor-shaft mounting mechanism is also highlighted. These effects are then analyzed using finite-element analysis for a 150-N/spl middot/m/6-kW integrated starter/alternator designed for operation up to 6000 r/min with an annular rotor to accommodate a torque converter or clutch assembly.

In addition to the full-order filtering problem, the challenging reduced-order case is also addressed by using different linearization procedures. Both full- and reduced-order filters can be obtained from the solution of convex optimization problems in terms of linear matrix inequalities, which can be solved via efficient interior-point algorithms.

The main advantage of this new formulation is that it can be used with any field defining irreducible polynomial. Using this formulation, we then develop a generalized architecture for the multiplier and analyze the time and gate complexities of the proposed multiplier as a function of degree m and the reduction matrix Q. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that these complexities are given in terms of Q. Unlike most other articles on bit parallel finite field multipliers, here we also consider the number of signals to be routed in hardware implementation and we show that, compared to the well-known Mastrovito's multiplier, the proposed architecture has fewer routed signals. The proposed generalized architecture is further optimized for three special types of polynomials, namely, equally spaced polynomials, trinomials, and pentanomials. We have obtained explicit formulas and complexities of the multipliers for these three special irreducible polynomials. This makes it very easy for a designer to implement the proposed multipliers using hardware description languages like VHDL and Verilog with minimum knowledge of finite field arithmetic.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2004.47","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1306989","Finite or Galois field;Mastrovito multiplier;all-one polynomial;polynomial basis;trinomial;pentanomial and equally-spaced polynomial.","Parallel architectures;Galois fields;Polynomials;Multiplying circuits;Digital arithmetic","parallel architectures;Galois fields;polynomials;multiplying circuits;digital arithmetic;circuit complexity","computational complexity;bit parallel architecture;Galois field;polynomial basis multiplication;reduction matrix;multiplier;time complexity;gate complexity;Mastrovito multiplier;finite field arithmetic","","165","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The task of designing and ensuring the correctness of applications in these environments is similarly becoming more complex. The unified goal of much of the research in distributed wireless systems is to provide higher-level abstractions of complex low-level concepts to application programmers, easing the design and implementation of applications. A new and growing class of applications for wireless sensor networks require similar complexity encapsulation. However, sensor networks have some unique characteristics, including dynamic availability of data sources and application quality of service requirements, that are not common to other types of applications. These unique features, combined with the inherent distribution of sensors, and limited energy and bandwidth resources, dictate the need for network functionality and the individual sensors to be controlled to best serve the application requirements. In this article, we describe different types of sensor network applications and discuss existing techniques for managing these types of networks. We also overview a variety of related middleware and argue that no existing approach provides all the management tools required by sensor network applications. To meet this need, we have developed a new middleware called MiLAN. MiLAN allows applications to specify a policy for managing the network and sensors, but the actual implementation of this policy is effected within MiLAN. We describe MiLAN and show its effectiveness through the design of a sensor-based personal health monitor.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.2004.1265828","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265828","","Middleware;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wireless sensor networks;Distributed computing;Programming profession;Encapsulation;Availability;Quality of service;Bandwidth;Monitoring","wireless sensor networks;wireless LAN;middleware;medical computing;patient monitoring","middleware;wireless connectivity;distribution connectivity;distributed wireless systems;wireless sensor networks;complexity encapsulation;service requirements;data sources;network functionality;MiLAN middleware;personal health monitor","","293","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Several congestion control proposals have been suggested to remedy this problem. The existing protocols consider mainly two properties: TCP friendliness and bandwidth scalability. That is, a protocol should not take away too much bandwidth from standard TCP flows while utilizing the full bandwidth of high-speed networks. This work presents another important constraint, namely, RTT (round trip time) unfairness where competing flows with different RTTs may consume vastly unfair bandwidth shares. Existing schemes have a severe RTT unfairness problem because the congestion window increase rate gets larger as the window grows ironically the very reason that makes them more scalable. RTT unfairness for high-speed networks occurs distinctly with drop tail routers for flows with large congestion windows where packet loss can be highly synchronized. After identifying the RTT unfairness problem of existing protocols, This work presents a new congestion control scheme that alleviates RTT unfairness while supporting TCP friendliness and bandwidth scalability. The proposed congestion control algorithm uses two window size control policies called additive increase and binary search increase. When the congestion window is large, additive increase with a large increment ensures square RTT unfairness as well as good scalability. Under small congestion windows, binary search increase supports TCP friendliness. The simulation results confirm these properties of the protocol.","0743-166X","0-7803-8355-9","10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354672","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1354672","","Bandwidth;Scalability;High-speed networks;Access protocols;Remote monitoring;Computer science;Bit error rate;Network interfaces;Tail;Internet","telecommunication congestion control;transport protocols;telecommunication network routing","binary increase congestion control;fast long-distance network;high-speed network;TCP friendliness;bandwidth scalability;round trip time unfairness;congestion window increase rate;drop tail router","","208","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, the transmission system transient stability is investigated when a fault is applied in all possible branches (regarding the N-1 security analysis).

However, there is an increase in the number of the voter circuits required for the STMR circuits. Virtex has abundant number of tri-state buffers that can be employed to construct SEU immune majority voter circuits. We also present a SEU fault insertion simulator designed to introduce errors representing SEUs in the circuits. STMR method is thoroughly tested on MCNC'91 benchmarks.

A standard technique for computing such descriptions is principal component analysis. However, principal component analysis is limited in that it only works for data lying in a Euclidean vector space. While this is certainly sufficient for geometric models that are parameterized by a set of landmarks or a dense collection of boundary points, it does not handle more complex representations of shape. We have been developing representations of geometry based on the medial axis description or m-rep. While the medial representation provides a rich language for variability in terms of bending, twisting, and widening, the medial parameters are not elements of a Euclidean vector space. They are in fact elements of a nonlinear Riemannian symmetric space. In this paper, we develop the method of principal geodesic analysis, a generalization of principal component analysis to the manifold setting. We demonstrate its use in describing the variability of medially-defined anatomical objects.

The main idea is to measure the distance between two shapes as the minimum extent of deformation necessary for one shape to match the other. Since the space of deformations is very high-dimensional, three steps are taken to make the search practical: 1) define an equivalence class for shapes based on shock-graph topology, 2) define an equivalence class for deformation paths based on shock-graph transitions, and 3) avoid complexity-increasing deformation paths by moving toward shock-graph degeneracy. Despite these steps, which tremendously reduce the search requirement, there still remain numerous deformation paths to consider. To that end, we employ an edit-distance algorithm for shock graphs that finds the optimal deformation path in polynomial time. The proposed approach gives intuitive correspondences for a variety of shapes and is robust in the presence of a wide range of visual transformations. The recognition rates on two distinct databases of 99 and 216 shapes each indicate highly successful within category matches (100 percent in top three matches), which render the framework potentially usable in a range of shape-based recognition applications.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2004.1273924","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1273924","","Electric shock;Shape measurement;Topology;Polynomials;Robustness;Visual databases;Rendering (computer graphics);Application software;Object recognition;Dynamic programming","image recognition;object recognition;equivalence classes;visual databases","shape recognition;shock graphs;object recognition;silhouettes;equivalence class;shock-graph topology;deformation paths;shock-graph transitions;edit-distance algorithm;polynomial time;visual transformations;databases;dynamic programming","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","492","","54","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

CC Steer is the first to compute paths with: 1) continuous curvature; 2) upper-bounded curvature; and 3) upper-bounded curvature derivative. CC Steer also verifies a topological property that ensures that when it is used within a general motion-planning scheme, it yields a complete collision-free path planner. The coupling of CC Steer with a general planning scheme yields a path planner that computes collision-free paths verifying the properties mentioned above. Accordingly, a car-like vehicle can follow such paths without ever having to stop in order to reorient its front wheels. Besides, such paths can be followed with a nominal speed which is proportional to the curvature derivative limit. The paths computed by CC Steer are made up of line segments, circular arcs, and clothoid arcs. They are not optimal in length. However, it is shown that they converge toward the optimal ""Reeds and Shepp"" paths when the curvature derivative upper bound tends to infinity. The capabilities of CC Steer to serve as an efficient steering method within two general planning schemes are also demonstrated.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2004.833789","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1362698","Nonholonomic vehicles;smooth path planning","Vehicles;Path planning;Wheels;Robots;Motion-planning;Upper bound;H infinity control;Kinematics;Axles;Turning","mobile robots;path planning;motion control;optimal control;optimisation","continuous-curvature paths;collision-free path planning;nonholonomic vehicles;motion planning scheme;optimal control","","231","","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Upon convergence, each mobile user will receive only the desired activated spatial modes with no cochannel interference. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of OSDM among the number of mobile users, the number of transmit antennas at the BS, and the number of receive antennas at the MS, are also derived.

The systems may possess a wide class of uncertainties referred to as unstructured uncertainties, which are not linearly parameterized and do not have any prior knowledge of the bounding functions. The Takagi-Sugeno type fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate the uncertainties. A unified and systematic procedure is employed to derive two kinds of novel robust adaptive tracking controllers by use of the input-to-state stability (ISS) and by combining the backstepping technique and generalized small gain approach. One is the robust adaptive fuzzy tracking controller (RAFTC) for the system without input gain uncertainty. The other is the robust adaptive fuzzy sliding tracking controller (RAFSTC) for the system with input gain uncertainty. Both algorithms have two advantages, those are, semi-global uniform ultimate boundedness of adaptive control system in the presence of unstructured uncertainties and the adaptive mechanism with minimal learning parameterizations.

The 64-point FFT is realized by decomposing it into a two-dimensional structure of 8-point FFTs. This approach reduces the number of required complex multiplications compared to the conventional radix-2 64-point FFT algorithm. The complex multiplication operations are realized using shift-and-add operations. Thus, the processor does not use a two-input digital multiplier. It also does not need any RAM or ROM for internal storage of coefficients. The proposed 64-point FFT/IFFT processor has been fabricated and tested successfully using our in-house 0.25-/spl mu/m BiCMOS technology. The core area of this chip is 6.8 mm/sup 2/. The average dynamic power consumption is 41 mW at 20 MHz operating frequency and 1.8 V supply voltage. The processor completes one parallel-to-parallel (i.e., when all input data are available in parallel and all output data are generated in parallel) 64-point FFT computation in 23 cycles.

This causes inter-carrier and inter-symbol interference (ICI/ISI) and hence a loss in per-subcarrier signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR). As observed in prior works, there is a trade-off between ICI/ISI power and capacity when lengthening the CP; for some channel profiles it is advantageous to allow some of the weaker channel rays to ""escape"" the CP. In this paper we examine how OFDM symbol length, CP length, and timing mismatch of a certain variance, impact the expected SINR and capacity based on recently measured channel profiles in a 20 MHz band at 3.7 GHz in suburban and urban environments. Capacity for the measured channels is evaluated for two representative symbol lengths of 10 /spl mu/s and 40 /spl mu/s. For the measured channels, capacity is maximized for a CP of 1-3 microseconds. However, a CP of 4-5 microseconds has only slightly less capacity and is much more robust to timing errors.","1090-3038","0-7803-8521-7","10.1109/VETECF.2004.1400066","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1400066","","Timing;Signal to noise ratio;Intersymbol interference;Length measurement;Frequency conversion;Frequency modulation;OFDM modulation;Power measurement;Channel capacity;Robustness","OFDM modulation;4G mobile communication;intersymbol interference;noise;channel capacity;timing;channel estimation","cyclic prefix length analysis;4G OFDM systems;channel rays;cyclic prefix interval;guard interval;orthogonal frequency division modulation;excessively long channels;timing errors;inter-carrier interference;inter-symbol interference;ICI;ISI;per-subcarrier signal-to-interference and noise ratio;SINR;OFDM symbol length;CP length;variance timing mismatch;channel profiles;channel capacity;suburban environments;urban environments;representative symbol lengths;measured channels;3.7 GHz;20 MHz;10 mus;40 mus;1 to 3 mus;4 to 5 mus","","35","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hydrogen has been hailed as the key to a clean energy future primarily because it can be produced from a variety of energy sources, it satisfies all energy needs, it is the least polluting, and it is the perfect carrier for solar energy in that it affords solar energy a storage medium. Efforts are underway to transform the global transportation energy economy from one dependent on oil to that based on sustainable hydrogen. The rationale behind these efforts is that hydrocarbon-based automobiles are a significant source of air pollution, while hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles produce effectively zero emissions. Besides the transportation area, fuel cells can also reduce emissions in other applications such as the residential or commercial distributed electricity generation. Hydrogen is the perfect partner for electricity, and together they create an integrated energy system based on distributed power generation and use. A discussion on the sources of hydrogen in the near- and long-term future as well as the cost of hydrogen production is provided.","1558-4216","","10.1109/MPAE.2004.1359020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1359020","","Automotive engineering;Fuels;Production;Solar energy;Transportation;Distributed power generation;Pollution;Energy storage;Hydrogen storage;Petroleum","fuel cell vehicles;fuel cells;hydrogen economy;transportation;fuel storage;solar power;electric power generation","automotive fuel;energy resources;transportation needs;electric power generation;solar energy;hydrogen energy;onboard utilization;hydrogen fueling stations","","39","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

However, the prospects for the future changed dramatically in 1987 with the discovery of layered cuprate superconductors with T/sub c/ values that now extend up to about 135 K. Fabrication of useful conductors out of the cuprates has been difficult, but a first generation of silver-sheathed composite conductors based on (Bi,Pb)/sub 2/Sr/sub 2/Ca/sub 2/Cu/sub 3/O/sub 10/ (T/sub c//spl sim/110 K) has already been commercialized. Recent progress on a second generation of biaxially aligned coated conductors using the less anisotropic YBa/sub 2/Cu/sub 3/O/sub 7/ structure has been rapid, suggesting that it too might enter service in the near future. The discovery of superconductivity in MgB/sub 2/ below 39 K in 2001 has brought yet another candidate material to the large-scale applications mix. Two distinct markets for superconductor wires exist-the more classical low-temperature magnet applications such as particle accelerators, nuclear magnetic resonance and magnetic resonance imaging magnets, and plasma-containment magnets for fusion power, and the newer and potentially much larger market for electric power equipment, such as motors, generators, synchronous condensers, power transmission cables, transformers, and fault-current limiters for the electric utility grid. We review key properties and recent progress in these materials and assess their prospects for further development and application.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2004.833673","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1335554","","Superconducting materials;Large-scale systems;Magnetic materials;Superconducting magnets;Superconductivity;Magnetic anisotropy;Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy;Magnetic devices;Conducting materials;Conductors","yttrium compounds;barium compounds;bismuth compounds;calcium compounds;niobium alloys;tin alloys;titanium alloys;magnesium compounds;high-temperature superconductors;type II superconductors;critical current density (superconductivity);multifilamentary superconductors;strontium compounds;superconducting critical field;superconducting tapes;reviews;superconducting cables","superconducting materials;large scale applications;superconducting transition temperature;superconducting magnets;cuprate superconductors;silver-sheathed composite conductors;biaxially aligned coated conductors;anisotropic YBa/sub 2/Cu/sub 3/O/sub 7/ structure;MgB/sub 2/ superconductivity;superconductor wires;classical low-temperature magnet applications;particle accelerators;nuclear magnetic resonance;magnetic resonance imaging magnets;plasma containment magnets;fusion power;electric power equipment;motors;generators;synchronous condensers;power transmission cables;transformers;Nb/sub 3/Sn;(BiPb)/sub 2/Sr/sub 2/Ca/sub 2/Cu/sub 3/O/sub 10/;Bi/sub 2/Sr/sub 2/CaCu/sub 2/O/sub 8/;NbTi;YBa/sub 2/Cu/sub 3/O/sub 7/;MgB/sub 2/","","123","","104","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The dichromatic reflection model describes the surface reflection as the sum of two components, diffuse and specular terms. The specular reflection component is usually strong in its intensity and polarized significantly compared to the diffuse components. On the other hand, the intensity of the diffuse component is weak and it tends to be unpolarized except near occluding contours. Thus, the observation of an object through a rotating polarizer approximately yields images containing constant diffuse component and specular component of different intensity. In this paper, we show that diffuse and specular components of surface reflection can be separated as two independent components when we apply independent component analysis to the images observed through a polarizer of different orientations.

In addition, some characteristics relevant to the low-voltage low-power circuits using operational amplifiers have been modeled. Finally, an optimization algorithm was used with the purpose of extracting the most efficient solution. The PFC is especially suitable for driving large capacitance loads. It improves frequency response, slew rate (SR), and settling time. Small compensation capacitors make it appropriate for integration in commercial CMOS processes. With an active area of 0.03 mm/sup 2/ and working at 1.5 V, the circuit dissipates 275 /spl mu/W, has more than a 100-dB gain, a gain bandwidth of 2.7 MHz, and 1.0 V/spl mu/s average SR while driving a 130-pF load.

In this paper, a maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) control scheme for IPM motor is proposed considering the temperature dependence of the magnet field.

When power flows from the low voltage side (battery: 48 V) to the high voltage side (dc link: 380 V), the circuit works in discharge operation (boost mode) to power the high voltage side load; otherwise, it works in charge operation (buck mode) to charge the low voltage side battery. A simple voltage clamp branch is used to limit transient voltage across the current-fed full bridge and realize zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) during discharge operation.

These junctions have a typical stack structure of Si(100)-Si/sub 3/N/sub 4/-Ru-CoFeB-Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/-CoFeB-Ru-FeCo-CrMnPt with the antiferromagnet CrMnPt layers for pinning at the top. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) reveals that the CoFeB has an amorphous structure and a smooth interface with the Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ tunnel barrier. Although it is difficult to pin the amorphous CoFeB directly from the top, the use of a synthetic antiferromagnet (SAF) pinned layer structure allows sufficient rigidity of the reference CoFeB layer. The tunnel junctions were annealed at 250/spl deg/C for 1 h and tested for magneto-transport properties with tunnel magnetoresistive (TMR) values as high as 70.4% at room temperature, which is the highest value ever reported for such a sandwich structure. This TMR value translates to a spin polarization of 51% for CoFeB, which is likely to be higher at lower temperatures. These junctions also have a low coercivity (Hc) and a low parallel coupling field (Hcoupl).

It is observed that, for the narrow-band case, the measured channel coefficients are complex Gaussian distributed and, consequently, we focus on a statistical description using the first- and second-order moments of MIMO radio channels. It is shown that the MIMO channel covariance matrix can be well approximated by the Kronecker product of the covariance matrices, seen from the transmitter and receiver, respectively. A narrow-band model for NLoS indoor MIMO channels is thus verified by these results. As for the wide-band case, it is observed that the average power-delay profile of each element of the channel impulse response matrix fits the exponential decay curve and that the Kronecker structure of the second-order moments can be extended to each channel tap. A wide-band MIMO channel model is then proposed, combining a simple COST 259 single-input-single-output channel model and the Kronecker structure. Monte Carlo simulations are used to generate indoor MIMO channel realizations according to the models discussed. The results are compared with the measured data using the channel capacity and good agreement is found.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2004.827164","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1300860","","Wideband;MIMO;Channel capacity;Radio transmitters;Narrowband;Covariance matrix;Receivers;Antenna measurements;Broadband antennas;Block codes","antenna arrays;channel capacity;multipath channels;MIMO systems;Gaussian distribution;covariance matrices;Monte Carlo methods;indoor radio","wideband MIMO radio channels;NLoS indoor measurements;Kronecker-structure based narrowband model;Gaussian distribution;covariance matrix;Kronecker product;transmitter;receiver;power-delay profile;impulse-response matrix;exponential decay curve;Kronecker structure;single-input single-output channel model;Monte Carlo simulations;channel capacity;antenna arrays;multipath channels;multiple-input multiple-output channels;nonline-of-sight","","162","","59","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These parameters can be used for traversability prediction or in a traction control algorithm to improve robot mobility and to plan safe action plans for autonomous systems. Terrain parameters are also valuable indicators of planetary surface soil composition. The algorithm relies on a simplified form of classical terramechanics equations and uses a linear-least squares method to compute terrain parameters in real time.

In future, damages from this type of attack are expected to become more serious. In addition, the bandwidth consumption by these attacks influences the entire network performance. This paper presents an abnormal network traffic detecting method and a system prototype. By aggregating packets that belong to the identical flow, we can reduce processing overhead in the system. We suggest a detecting algorithm using changes in traffic patterns that appear during attacks. This algorithm can detect even mutant attacks that use a new port number or changed payload, while signature-based systems are not capable of detecting these types of attacks. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can identify attacks that cannot be detected by examining only single packet information.","1542-1201","0-7803-8230-7","10.1109/NOMS.2004.1317747","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1317747","","Telecommunication traffic;Prototypes;Information security;IP networks;Delay;Bandwidth;Payloads;Computer crime;Detection algorithms;Computer science","telecommunication traffic recording;telecommunication security;Internet;performance evaluation;packet switching;monitoring;computer network management","flow-based method;abnormal network traffic detection;network security attacks;indirect attacks;bandwidth consumption;network performance;packet aggregation;identical flow;Internet;traffic monitoring;traffic analysis;processing overhead reduction;traffic pattern changes;mutant attacks;new port number;changed payload","","24","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

EBSE promises a number of benefits by encouraging integration of research results with a view to supporting the needs of many different stakeholder groups. However, we do not currently have the infrastructure needed for widespread adoption of EBSE. The skill factor means software engineering experiments are vulnerable to subject and experimenter bias. The lifecycle factor means it is difficult to determine how technologies will behave once deployed.

We examine a number of optimization criteria, and extend their applicability by using the generalized singular value decomposition to circumvent the nonsingularity requirement. The result is a generalization of discriminant analysis that can be applied even when the sample size is smaller than the dimension of the sample data.

We report an implantable sensor that, when used with an external fiber-optic probe, takes advantage of the oxygen stimulated fluorescence quenching of dichloro(tris-1,10-phenanthroline) ruthenium (II) hydrate. This fluorophore was immobilized in a photopolymerized hydrogel made from poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEG-DA), a polymer known to minimize protein and cell adhesion. A low-average molecular weight PEG-DA (MW = 575) was employed to hinder the fluorophore from leaching. The PEG-DA precursor solution contained 40% H/sub 2/O such that, upon polymerization, the gel was already in the hydrated state. Sensor hydrogels stored in H/sub 2/O for several months retained their physical shape and sensitivity to oxygen. The sensor showed a high degree of reproducibility across a range of oxygen concentrations that are typical for cell culture experiments (0-9.1 ppm O/sub 2/), and a linear model produced a strong correlation (R /sup 2/= 0.995) compared with a commercial electrochemical probe.

The work considers two current source cell topologies, namely a simple cell and a cascoded cell, obtaining the relation of transistors design parameters to the static and dynamic models. On the one hand, a mismatching statistical analysis is applied to all the transistors of the current source circuit, which allows to define design expressions relating the circuit parameters to the DAC specifications without the need of arbitrary design margins or Monte Carlo simulations. On the other hand, improved analysis of the current source switching characteristics provides a more realistic modeling of the relation between transistors sizes and output current settling time.

As is well known, the carrier frequency offset attenuates the desired signal and causes intercarrier interference, thus reducing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The SNR degradation due to the carrier frequency offset is evaluated by deriving the exact SNR expression in the presence of the carrier frequency offset. The SNR analysis can be used for the design of a practical OFDM system in determining how small the frequency offset should be in order to maintain the SNR degradation to negligible levels.","","0-7803-8794-5","10.1109/GLOCOM.2004.1379064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1379064","","Fading;Signal to noise ratio;Degradation;Interference;Frequency synchronization;AWGN;OFDM modulation;Wireless LAN;Digital video broadcasting;DSL","OFDM modulation;radiofrequency interference;multipath channels;fading channels","carrier frequency offset;OFDM systems;multipath fading channels;multipath channels;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;intercarrier interference;signal-to-noise ratio;SNR","","29","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The problem involves vehicles with independent dynamics but with coupled constraints to capture required cooperative behavior. Using a recently-developed form of DMPC, each vehicle plans only for its own actions, but feasibility of the sub-problems and satisfaction of the coupling constraints are guaranteed throughout, despite the action of unknown but bounded disturbances. UAVs communicate relevant plan data to ensure that decisions are consistent across the team. Collision avoidance is used as an example of coupled constraints and the paper shows how the speed, turn rate and avoidance distance limits in the optimization should be modified in order to guarantee robust constraint satisfaction. Integer programming is used to solve the non-convex problem of path-planning subject to avoidance constraints. Numerical simulations compare computation time and target arrival time under decentralized and centralized control and investigate the impact of decentralization on team performance. The results show that the computation required for DMPC is significantly lower than for its centralized counterpart and scales better with the size of the team, at the expense of only a small increase in UAV flight times.","0191-2216","0-7803-8682-5","10.1109/CDC.2004.1429425","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1429425","","Predictive models;Predictive control;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Robust control;Vehicle dynamics;Collision avoidance;Constraint optimization;Robustness;Linear programming;Path planning","decentralised control;remotely operated vehicles;aircraft control;predictive control;multi-robot systems;collision avoidance;integer programming;linear programming","decentralized model predictive control;cooperating UAVs;cooperating uninhabited aerial vehicles;cooperative behavior;coupling constraints;collision avoidance;robust constraint satisfaction;integer programming;nonconvex problem;path planning","","91","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the speed of operation increases, the variables that are neglected in the lower frequency/higher rise time situation become more significant. Such parameters increase the complexity of the design.

Meta-heuristic methods overcome this limitation, and offer a practical way to solve large instances of the relaxed RAP where different components can be placed in parallel. The ant colony method has not yet been used in reliability design, yet it is a method that is expressly designed for combinatorial problems with a neighborhood structure, as in the case of the RAP. An ant colony optimization algorithm for the RAP is devised & tested on a well-known suite of problems from the literature. It is shown that the ant colony method performs with little variability over problem instance or random number seed.

MDS-MAP is a recent localization method based on multidimensional scaling (MDS). It uses connectivity information - who is within communications range of whom - to derive the locations of the nodes in the network, and can take advantage of additional data, such as estimated distances between neighbors or known positions for certain anchor nodes, if they are available. However, MDS-MAP is an inherently centralized algorithm and is therefore of limited utility in many applications. In this paper, we present a new variant of the MDS-MAP method, which we call MDS-MAP(P) standing for MDS-MAP using patches of relative maps, that can be executed in a distributed fashion. Using extensive simulations, we show that the new algorithm not only preserves the good performance of the original method on relatively uniform layouts, but also performs much better than the original on irregularly-shaped networks. The main idea is to build a local map at each node of the immediate vicinity and then merge these maps together to form a global map. This approach works much better for topologies in which the shortest path distance between two nodes does not correspond well to their Euclidean distance. We also discuss an optional refinement step that improves solution quality even further at the expense of additional computation.","0743-166X","0-7803-8355-9","10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354683","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1354683","","Acoustic sensors;Temperature sensors;Global Positioning System;Multidimensional systems;Euclidean distance;Computer science;Communication networks;Network topology;Large-scale systems;Actuators","radio networks","geographic position;communications network;localization method;multidimensional scaling;connectivity information;centralized algorithm;irregularly-shaped network;global map;Euclidean distance","","347","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As perfect knowledge is rarely available, transmitter designs based on partial (statistical) channel state information (CSI) are of paramount importance not only because they are more practical but also because they encompass the perfect- and no-knowledge paradigms. In this paper, we first provide a partial CSI model for orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) transmissions over multi-input multi-output (MIMO) frequency-selective fading channels. We then develop an adaptive MIMO-OFDM transmitter by applying an adaptive two-dimensional (2-D) coder-beamformer we derived recently on each OFDM subcarrier, along with an adaptive power and bit loading scheme across OFDM subcarriers. Relying on the available partial CSI at the transmitter, our objective is to maximize the transmission rate, while guaranteeing a prescribed error performance, under the constraint of fixed transmit-power. Numerical results confirm that the adaptive 2-D space-time coder-beamformer (with two basis beams as the two ""strongest"" eigenvectors of the channel's correlation matrix perceived at the transmitter) combined with adaptive OFDM (power and bit loaded with M-ary quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) constellations) improves the transmission rate considerably.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2003.819986","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254037","","Channel state information;Transmitters;OFDM;Quadrature amplitude modulation;Frequency division multiplexing;MIMO;Frequency-selective fading channels;Two dimensional displays;Amplitude modulation;Modulation coding","MIMO systems;OFDM modulation;adaptive modulation;radio transmitters;fading channels;error statistics;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;matrix algebra;quadrature amplitude modulation;space-time codes","adaptive MIMO-OFDM;multiple-input multiple-output;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;partial channel state information;transmitter designs;frequency-selective fading channels;2D space-time code-beamformer;OFDM subcarrier;bit loading scheme;adaptive power;transmission rate;eigenvectors;correlation matrix;M-ary QAM;quadrature amplitude modulation;adaptive modulation;power splitting;BER;bit error rate","","170","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this issue, two alternative fusion schemes, namely, the maximum ratio combining statistic and a two-stage approach using the Chair-Varshney fusion rule, are proposed that alleviate these requirements and are shown to be the low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) equivalents of the likelihood-based fusion rule.

Techniques to prevent this type of attacks require that all application input must be checked up and filtered, encoded, or validated before sending them to any user. In order to discover the XSS vulnerabilities in a Web application, traditional source code analysis techniques can be exploited. In this paper, in order to assess the XSS vulnerability of a Web application, an approach that combines static and dynamic analysis of the Web application is presented.

As a triband antenna, the inverted-F antenna is for the low band, while the branch element is for the middle band and the coupled element for the high band. In some applications, the middle and the high bands can be combined as one band to form a dual band antenna. No additional matching network is required in this antenna design and as a result, the antenna efficiency is high. The method of moments is used for the analysis.

To help developers and maintainers detect and localize design problems in a system, we propose a novel mechanism - called detection strategy - for formulating metrics-based rules that capture deviations from good design principles and heuristics. Using detection strategies an engineer can directly localize classes or methods affected by a particular design flaw (e.g., God Class), rather than having to infer the real design problem from a large set of abnormal metric values. We have defined such detection strategies for capturing around ten important flaws of object-oriented design found in the literature and validated the approach experimentally on multiple large-scale case-studies.","1063-6773","0-7695-2213-0","10.1109/ICSM.2004.1357820","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1357820","","Software design;Diseases;Software maintenance;Software systems;Large-scale systems;Object oriented modeling;Computer science;Intelligent systems;Maintenance engineering;Design engineering","software maintenance;object-oriented programming;software metrics;program debugging","detection strategy;metrics-based rule;design flaw detection;software maintenance;object-oriented software system;isolation metrics;abnormal metric value;object-oriented design;quality assurance;design heuristics","","208","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

No.04CH37551)","","2004","5","","3812","3817 Vol.5","Current-mode control, the standard method to control inductive switching power supplies can also be used in switched capacitor converters. Here, regulation is achieved by operating one transistor in the charge pump output stage as a controlled current source. Compared with voltage mode operation where the transistor on-resistances is regulated, current mode keeps the small signal output resistance of the converter stage high even with high load currents. This always keeps the output pole, which is the dominant pole in current mode charge pumps at low frequencies even at heavy loads and makes the system easy to stabilize. Provided that the output pole is kept three to five times smaller than any parasitic internal poles, than a first order system is possible. When the controlled current source is placed in the discharge path then the converter always runs with a fully charged flying capacitor, which improves transient response. The universal second order current mode charge pump small signal model presented in this paper consists of a gm-stage error amplifier and a gm-output stage as regulated section. The model also includes the output resistance of the gm-stages, parasitic capacitances, the internal R-C compensation and the external components like the feedback divider, output resistor and load capacitor. The flying capacitor is modeled with a voltage source. By giving this voltage source different values the model can be used with any charge pump topology (doubler, tripler, inverter....). Experimental results show that by comparing the transient response the small signal model well matches with the measured performance. Since model can be used for AC and transient analysis an early prediction of stability and dynamic behavior of the converter is possible. Like inductive current mode converters the maximum output current is limited in the regulated section, which makes the converter short circuit protected.","0275-9306","0-7803-8399-0","10.1109/PESC.2004.1355149","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1355149","","Charge pumps;Topology;Capacitors;Voltage;Transient response;Power supplies;Switching converters;Frequency;Fault location;Parasitic capacitance","electric current control;switched mode power supplies;switching convertors;capacitor storage;transient response;amplifiers;RC circuits;transient analysis;stability;capacitor switching;error compensation;dividing circuits","current mode charge pump;current-mode control;inductive switching power supply control;switched capacitor converters;transistors;voltage mode control;dominant pole;parasitic internal poles;discharge path;flying capacitor;transient response;gm-stage error amplifier;resistance;parasitic capacitances;RC compensation;feedback divider;small signal model;transient analysis;stability prediction;dynamic behavior;inductive current mode converters;circuit protection","","11","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, lowering the OSR limits the efficiency of a /spl Delta//spl Sigma/ ADC in achieving a high-resolution A/D conversion. This paper presents several techniques that enable the OSR reduction in /spl Delta//spl Sigma/ ADCs without compromising the resolution. 1) Noise transfer function (NTF). In this paper, a single-stage multibit /spl Delta//spl Sigma/ modulator with a high-order finite-impulse-response NTF is proposed to achieve high signal-to-quantization-noise ratios at low OSRs. Its key features include: decreased circuit complexity, improved robustness to modulator coefficient variations, and reduced sensitivity to integrator nonlinearities. Its performance is validated through behavioral simulations and compared to traditional /spl Delta//spl Sigma/ modulator structures. 2) Signal transfer function (STF). This paper describes how the STF of a /spl Delta//spl Sigma/ modulator can be designed, independently of the NTF, in order to significantly reduce the harmonic distortion due to opamp nonidealities and to help lower the power dissipation. 3) Dynamic element matching (DEM) is also presented. Data weighted averaging (DWA) has prevailed as the most practical DEM technique to linearize the internal digital-to-analog converter (DAC) of a multibit /spl Delta//spl Sigma/ modulator, especially when the number of DAC elements is large. However, the occurrence of in-band signal-dependent tones, when using DWA at a low OSR, degrades the spurious-free dynamic range. This paper proposes a simple technique, called pseudo DWA, to solve the DWA tone problem without sacrificing the signal-to-noise ratio. Its implementation adds no extra delay in the /spl Delta//spl Sigma/ feedback loop and requires only minimal additional digital hardware. Existing schemes for DWA tone reduction are also compared.","1558-0806","","10.1109/TCSI.2003.821291","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259489","","Delta modulation;Transfer functions;Analog-digital conversion;Broadband communication;Signal resolution;Noise reduction;Circuit noise;Complexity theory;Noise robustness;Circuit simulation","analogue-digital conversion;signal resolution;signal sampling;transfer functions;harmonic distortion;circuit simulation;FIR filters;delta-sigma modulation;integrated circuit noise;high-speed integrated circuits","high-order multibit modulators;pseudo data-weighted-averaging;low-oversampling /spl Delta//spl Sigma/ ADC;high-speed high-resolution analog-to-digital converters;broad-band communication applications;oversampling ratio;OSR;ADC efficiency;A/D conversion resolution;noise transfer function;single-stage multibit /spl Delta//spl Sigma/ modulator;high-order finite-impulse-response NTF;signal-to-quantization-noise ratios;circuit complexity;modulator coefficient variation robustness;integrator nonlinearity sensitivity;behavioral simulations;signal transfer function;harmonic distortion;opamp nonidealities;power dissipation;dynamic element matching;STF;DEM;data weighted averaging;DWA;internal digital-to-analog converter linearization;multibit /spl Delta//spl Sigma/ modulator;DAC elements;in-band signal-dependent tones;spurious-free dynamic range;signal-to-noise ratio;feedback loop;digital hardware;DWA tone reduction","","106","","53","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We then can merge the information from preceding frames with that provided by a very limited number of keyframes created during a training stage, which results in a real-time tracker that does not jitter or drift and can deal with significant aspect changes.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2004.92","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1323807","Index Terms- Computer vision;real-time systems;tracking.","Cameras;Robustness;Jitter;Target tracking;Machine vision;Real time systems;Augmented reality;Shape;Image sequences;Computer vision","tracking;real-time systems;cameras;image matching;image registration;computer vision","stable real-time 3D tracking;online information;offline information;rigid objects;camera displacements;occlusion;offline camera registration;robust online tracking;real-time algorithms;local bundle adjustment;short baseline matching;wide baseline matching;robustness","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Graphics;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Movement;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Online Systems;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique","191","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two kinds of stubs, stepped-impedance and different-length stubs, are examined in this paper. The first section concerns stepped-impedance stubs. We have previously reported some simplifications of the fundamental equations. Here, we propose a new simplification together with synthesis; both allow an independent control of the two attenuated bands. In a second section, a DBR composed of two uniform stubs of different lengths is studied instead of two stepped-impedance open-circuited stubs. This implies a greatly simplified synthesis and implementation. Some other structures combining short- and open-circuited stubs are also introduced. Throughout the paper, simulations are proposed to illustrate the possibilities offered by such topologies. Experimental results in microstrip technology are also presented in order to validate our idea.

The main purpose of this paper is to study a new methodology to model and predict chaotic time series based on a new recurrent predictor neural network (RPNN). This method realizes long-term prediction by making accurate multistep predictions. This RPNN consists of nonlinearly operated nodes whose outputs are only connected with the inputs of themselves and the latter nodes. The connections may contain multiple branches with time delays. An extended algorithm of self-adaptive back-propagation through time (BPTT) learning algorithm is used to train the RPNN. In simulation, two performance measures [root-mean-square error (RMSE) and prediction accuracy (PA)] show that the proposed method is more effective and accurate for multistep prediction. It can identify the systems characteristics quite well and provide a new way to make long-term prediction of the chaotic time series.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2004.837418","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1356236","Chaos;prediction;recurrent neural network","Chaos;Neural networks;Recurrent neural networks;Delay effects;Feedforward systems;Predictive models;Nonlinear equations;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Signal processing algorithms;Accuracy","time series;recurrent neural nets;backpropagation;mean square error methods;signal processing;chaos;prediction theory","chaotic time series;recurrent predictor neural network;nonlinearly operated nodes;self-adaptive back-propagation through time learning algorithm;root-mean-square error;prediction accuracy","","137","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper we describe a new concept for a wireless electrocardiogram (ECG) system intended for continuous monitoring of ECG activity especially designed for arrhythmia diagnostic purposes. The patient is wearing an ECG sensor, ""a smart electronic electrode"", with wireless transmission of ECG signals to a dedicated hand held device (HHD). This device is monitoring the continuously recorded ECG signal, and can detect abnormal ECG activity using an automatic arrhythmia detector. Based on this, the device will transmit alarm conditions to a remote clinical alarm station (CAS). The system will act as a continuous event recorder, which can be used to follow up patients who have survived cardiac arrest, ventricular tachycardia or cardiac syncope but also for diagnostic purposes for patients with diffuse arrhythmia symptoms.

A complete visual inspection of the EEG recordings acquired during nocturnal polysomnography is time consuming, expensive, and often subjective. Therefore, feature extraction is implemented as an essential preprocessing step to achieve significant data reduction and to determine informative measures for automatic sleep staging. However, the analysis of the EEG signal and extraction of sensitive measures from it has been a challenging task due to the complexity and variability of this signal. We present three different schemes to extract features from the EEG signal: relative spectral band energy, harmonic parameters, and Itakura distance. Spectral estimation is performed by using autoregressive (AR) modeling. We then compare the performance of these schemes with the view to select an optimal set of features for specific, sensitive, and accurate neuro-fuzzy classification of sleep stages.","","0-7803-8439-3","10.1109/IEMBS.2004.1403125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1403125","Sleep staging;EEG signal processing;feature extraction;biomedical signal processing;harmonic parameters;Itakura distance;sleep apnea","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Frequency;Brain;Rhythm;Low voltage;Biomedical signal processing;Sleep apnea;Laboratories;Electrocardiography","electroencephalography;sleep;medical signal processing;feature extraction;data reduction;spectral analysis;autoregressive processes;fuzzy neural nets","EEG feature extraction;automated sleep staging;EEG signal analysis;sleep disorders;nocturnal polysomnography;relative spectral band energy;harmonic parameters;Itakura distance;spectral estimation;autoregressive modeling;neuro-fuzzy classification;data reduction","","26","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

R&D Establ., Dehra Dun, India","IEEE Sensors Journal","","2004","4","5","664","669","This paper presents a new variant of the Boston Consulting Group matrix analysis and applies it on sensor technologies. This classifies technologies in four classes on the basis of application growth rate of technology on one axis and competence available on the other. The quadrant, with high competence and increasing application growth rate, will be the most favored one and called star. The star technologies need application-oriented research with low risk, but they need money for design and development. A new sensor suite can select these technologies if the product development time available is roughly two to three years. The quadrant with low competence but high application growth rate is the question mark. The question mark technologies need intense R&D efforts, and they involve money and high to moderate risk. These technologies can be selected if product development time available is roughly more than three years. The technologies with low or falling application growth rate, but high competence available, are cash cows. These technologies are readily available (sometimes with production agencies), need absolutely no research, and a little bit of design or application orientation. In the cases where products are immediately needed, they have to be cheaper and do not need to last long technology wise; these can be selected. Finally, the quadrant with low competence and low application growth rate is called dogs, and such technologies can be left during consideration. Time and cost frames have also been well discussed. The role of development trends in prediction of technological evolution through a new BCG matrix is a new aspect introduced in this paper. As an example, this paper applies the above analysis in the area of night vision.

We consider spatial diversity at both the transmitter and receiver, as well as time diversity as a means to mitigate the short-term loss of signal strength. Using direct detection receivers and binary pulse position modulation as an example, we derive the outage probability of spatial diversity and time diversity systems that use equal gain combining (EGC), optimal combining, and select-max combining. The power gain of using these diversity systems is found to be substantial, and the performance of equal gain combining is found to be almost as good as optimal combining.

We found that, whatever the frequency and the induction waveform, the loss behavior can be quantitatively assessed within the theoretical framework of the statistical loss model. The prediction requires a limited set of preemptive experimental data, depending on whether or not the arbitrary J(t) waveform is endowed with local slope inversions (i.e., minor hysteresis loops) in its periodic time behavior. In the absence of minor loops, such data reduce, for any peak polarization value J/sub p/, to the loss figures obtained under sinusoidal J(t) at two different frequency values. In the presence of minor loops of semiamplitude J/sub m/, the two-frequency loss experiment should be carried out for both peak polarization values J/sub p/ and J/sub m/. Additional knowledge of the quasi-static major loop, to be used for modeling hysteresis loss, does improve the accuracy of the prediction method. A more general approach to loss in soft magnetic laminations is obtained in this way, the only limitation apparently being the onset of skin effect at high frequencies.","1941-0069","","10.1109/TMAG.2004.830510","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1325347","","Magnetic losses;Steel;Magnetic hysteresis;Soft magnetic materials;Polarization;Frequency;Lamination;Predictive models;Accuracy;Prediction methods","soft magnetic materials;magnetic hysteresis;electromagnetic induction;magnetic leakage;eddy currents;statistical analysis","magnetic steels;arbitrary induction waveform;minor hysteresis loops;power loss prediction;soft magnetic laminations;generic time dependence;periodic magnetic polarization;theoretical framework;statistical loss model;local slope inversions;periodic time behavior;data reduce;peak polarization;quasi-static major loop;hysteresis loss modeling;skin effect;eddy currents;magnetic loss prediction;Preisach models;magnetic hysteresis;soft magnetic materials","","173","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The protection of the confidentiality of this information has been a long-term goal for the database security research community and for the government statistical agencies. Recent advances in data mining and machine learning algorithms have increased the disclosure risks that one may encounter when releasing data to outside parties. A key problem, and still not sufficiently investigated, is the need to balance the confidentiality of the disclosed data with the legitimate needs of the data users. Every disclosure limitation method affects, in some way, and modifies true data values and relationships. We investigate confidentiality issues of a broad category of rules, the association rules. In particular, we present three strategies and five algorithms for hiding a group of association rules, which is characterized as sensitive. One rule is characterized as sensitive if its disclosure risk is above a certain privacy threshold. Sometimes, sensitive rules should not be disclosed to the public since, among other things, they may be used for inferring sensitive data, or they may provide business competitors with an advantage. We also perform an evaluation study of the hiding algorithms in order to analyze their time complexity and the impact that they have in the original database.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2004.1269668","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269668","","Association rules;Protection;Databases;Data security;Information security;Government;Data mining;Machine learning algorithms;Privacy;Performance evaluation","authorisation;data encapsulation;data mining;computational complexity;data privacy;very large databases","association rule hiding algorithm;unauthorized access;information confidentiality;database security research community;government statistical agencies;machine learning algorithms;business competitors;time complexity;privacy preserving data mining;association rule mining;sensitive rule hiding","","254","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The problem of selecting the best slack bus, or buses, is first formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem. Then, the results obtained are justified on the basis of the involved equality constraint being a quasilinear function, leading to an LP problem with trivial solution. It turns out that the optimal solution can be easily found from the results of a conventional load flow at a moderate cost.

The value of industrial robots has decreased in that term, even though they have undergone considerable technical advances. On the other hand, human interactive robots for psychological enrichment are a type of service robots that provide a service by interacting with humans while stimulating their minds. As opposed to industrial robots, accuracy or speed is not always of prime importance. Their function or purpose is not simply entertainment, but also to render assistance, to guide, to provide therapy, to educate, to enable communication, and so on. The market for human interactive robots designed for psychological enrichment is expected to grow rapidly and to become more widespread.

When contralateral arm control was employed, we found that a simple on/off strategy allowed for faster interaction with objects, while variable control provided more controlled interactions, especially with deformable objects. Furthermore, we designed a control strategy that allowed for a natural reaching and pinching sequence without the use of the contralateral arm. We validated that the EMG signal from the ipsilateral biceps could be used to develop an extremely reliable natural reaching and pinching algorithm.

By exploiting the low-thermal conductivity of the composite and presumably high-power factor of the nanowires, a thermoelectric figure of merit, higher than the corresponding bulk value, should result. Arrays were first synthesized using a vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) process leading to one-dimensional (1-D) growth of single-crystalline nanowires. To provide structural support while maintaining thermal isolation between nanowires, parylene, a low thermal conductivity and extremely conformal polymer, was embedded within the arrays. Mechanical polishing and oxygen plasma etching techniques were used to expose the nanowire tips and a metal contact was deposited on the top surface.

By selecting the topology of the microstrip feed network, the aperture's electric field distribution is manipulated to create two fictitious short circuits along the slot, hence creating two additional resonances besides the main one. The frequencies of these fictitious resonances can be chosen such that the overall bandwidth of the antenna is drastically increased. By using this technique, a slot antenna with a 1.8:1 bandwidth ratio is designed and fabricated. The measured results of this antenna show similar radiation patterns at different frequencies in its band of operation. Furthermore, the antenna has a relatively constant gain and, more importantly, it has an excellent polarization purity over the entire bandwidth.","1548-5757","","10.1109/LAWP.2004.825093","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1283249","","Broadband antennas;Slot antennas;Bandwidth;Resonance;Frequency;Network topology;Circuit topology;Microstrip;Feeds;RLC circuits","slot antennas;broadband antennas;multifrequency antennas;electric fields;antenna radiation patterns;electromagnetic wave polarisation;antenna feeds","multiresonant antenna;single-element wideband antenna;multiresonant single-element wideband slot antenna;electric field distribution;fictitious short circuits;radiation patterns;antenna gain;polarization purity;printed antennas;microstrip feed network topology","","109","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A risk-based decision support system (DSS) that reduces the amount of time spent on inspection has been presented. The risk-based DSS uses the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), a multiple attribute decision-making technique, to identify the factors that influence failure on specific segments and analyzes their effects by determining probability of occurrence of these risk factors. The severity of failure is determined through consequence analysis. From this, the effect of a failure caused by each risk factor can be established in terms of cost and the cumulative effect of failure is determined through probability analysis. The model optimizes the cost of pipeline operations by reducing subjectivity in selecting a specific inspection method, identifying and prioritizing the right pipeline segment for inspection and maintenance, deriving budget allocation, providing guidance to deploy the right mix labor for inspection and maintenance, planning emergency preparation, and deriving logical insurance plan. The proposed methodology also helps derive inspection and maintenance policy for the entire pipeline system, suggest design, operational philosophy, and construction methodology for new pipelines.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2003.822464","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1266853","","Decision support systems;Inspection;Maintenance;Costs","pipelines;decision making;decision support systems;risk analysis;insurance;inspection;maintenance engineering;cost-benefit analysis","oil pipelines;pipeline health monitoring;risk-based decision support system;DSS;analytic hierarchy process;AHP;probability analysis;multiple attribute decision-making technique;emergency preparation;deriving logical insurance plan;pipeline maintenance policy;operational philosophy;new pipelines construction methodology;pipeline inspection;petroleum pipelines","","54","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Time- and frequency-domain simulation of a 90-W LDMOS PA output using this novel neural-network model exhibit a good agreement between the RVTDNN behavioral model's predicted results and measured ones along with a good generality. Moreover, dynamic AM/AM and AM/PM characteristics obtained using the proposed model demonstrated that the RVTDNN can track and account for the memory effects of the PAs well. These characteristics also point out that the small-signal response of the LDMOS PA is more affected by the memory effects than the PAs large-signal response when it is driven by 3G signals. This RVTDNN model requires a significantly reduced complexity and shorter processing time in the analysis and training procedures, when driven with complex modulated and highly varying envelope signals such as 3G signals, than previously published neural-network-based PA models.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2004.823583","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1273746","","Power amplifiers;Neural networks;Autoregressive processes;Power system modeling;Predictive models;Frequency measurement;Signal analysis;Signal processing;Polynomials;Solid state circuits","feedforward neural nets;UHF power amplifiers;telecommunication computing;3G mobile communication;delay lines;communication complexity;time-domain analysis;frequency-domain analysis;intermodulation distortion","3G power amplifiers;dynamic behavioral modeling;real-valued time-delay neural networks;baseband nonlinear behaviors;base-station power amplifiers;AM-AM characteristics;AM-PM characteristics;small-signal response;reduced complexity;memory effects;feedforward neural network;tapped delay lines","","131","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is a two-stage system in which a mulitersolution S-transform is used to generate a set of optimal feature vectors in the first stage. The multiresolution S-transform is based on a variable width analysis window, which changes with frequency according to a user-defined function. Thus, the resolution in time or the related resolution in frequency is a general function of the frequency and two parameters, which can be chosen according to signal characteristics. The multiresolution S-transform can be seen either as a phase-corrected version of the wavelet transform or a variable window short time Fourier transform that simultaneously localizes both real and imaginary spectra of the signal. The features obtained from S-transform analysis of the power quality disturbance signals are much more amenable for pattern recognition purposes unlike the currently available wavelet transform techniques. In stage two, a fuzzy logic-based pattern recognition system is used to classify the various disturbance waveforms generated due to power quality violations. The fuzzy approach is found to be very simple and classification accuracy is more than 98% in most cases of power quality disturbances.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2003.820180","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1256395","","Fuzzy systems;Power quality;Signal resolution;Pattern recognition;Frequency;Fourier transforms;Wavelet transforms;Image resolution;Pattern analysis;Signal analysis","pattern recognition;power supply quality;fuzzy systems;fuzzy logic;power system faults;wavelet transforms;Fourier transforms;power system analysis computing","multiresolution S-transform;fuzzy recognition systems;power quality events;pattern recognition;power quality disturbances;two-stage system;optimal feature vector;variable width analysis window;user-defined function;wavelet transform;Fourier transform;fuzzy logic;power quality violations","","168","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes a novel utilization of the existing DG nonlinear interface not only to control the active power flow, but also to mitigate unbalance and harmonics, and to manage the reactive power of the system. The proposed Flexible Distributed Generation (FDG) is similar in functionality to FACTS, but works at the distribution level. Moreover, a novel ADAptive LINEar neuron (ADALINE) structure is presented. The new structure is applied to multi output (MO) systems for parameter tracking/estimation, and is called MO-ADALINE. It is dedicated to symmetrical components estimation. The control loop combines a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) for voltage regulation, and a processing unit-based ADALINE to deal with unbalance, harmonics and reactive power compensation. One advantage of the proposed control system is its insensitivity to parameter variation, a necessity for distribution system applications.

The processing utilizes the command/response signal and hydraulic pressure data from the actuators and provides a real-time assessment of the current/future actuator health state. This methodology was applied to F/A-18 stabilator electro-hydraulic servo valves (EHSVs) using test stand data provided by Boeing Phantom works.

Lab., Lysaker, Norway; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","","2004","30","8","491","506","The relationships between coupling and external quality factors of object-oriented software have been studied extensively for the past few years. For example, several studies have identified clear empirical relationships between class-level coupling and class fault-proneness. A common way to define and measure coupling is through structural properties and static code analysis. However, because of polymorphism, dynamic binding, and the common presence of unused (""dead"") code in commercial software, the resulting coupling measures are imprecise as they do not perfectly reflect the actual coupling taking place among classes at runtime. For example, when using static analysis to measure coupling, it is difficult and sometimes impossible to determine what actual methods can be invoked from a client class if those methods are overridden in the subclasses of the server classes. Coupling measurement has traditionally been performed using static code analysis, because most of the existing work was done on nonobject oriented code and because dynamic code analysis is more expensive and complex to perform. For modern software systems, however, this focus on static analysis can be problematic because although dynamic binding existed before the advent of object-orientation, its usage has increased significantly in the last decade. We describe how coupling can be defined and precisely measured based on dynamic analysis of systems. We refer to this type of coupling as dynamic coupling. An empirical evaluation of the proposed dynamic coupling measures is reported in which we study the relationship of these measures with the change proneness of classes. Data from maintenance releases of a large Java system are used for this purpose. Preliminary results suggest that some dynamic coupling measures are significant indicators of change proneness and that they complement existing coupling measures based on static analysis.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2004.41","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1316867","Index Terms- Coupling measurement;change predictions;quality modeling;maintenance.","Software measurement;Object oriented modeling;Software quality;Predictive models;Performance evaluation;Performance analysis;Q factor;Fault diagnosis;Runtime;Software systems","object-oriented programming;program diagnostics;software quality;software maintenance;inheritance","dynamic coupling;object-oriented software;class-level coupling;class fault-proneness;static code analysis;polymorphism;dynamic binding;software quality modeling;software maintenance","","177","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The system operator generates a signal, area control error (ACE) signal at PJM, based on the difference between these two parameters. The expected goal is to keep the system near nominal 60 or 50 Hz. Traditionally, frequency regulation is managed by varying the output of fossil fuel or hydro generators connected to the electric grid. The authors present a new method in which electric energy is recycled. First, absorbing energy when it is in abundance, then discharging the same for the desired frequency regulation effect. The proposed system is based on kinetic energy storage technology in high-speed flywheels. Performance modeling results, based on actual ACE signals, indicate that a modular flywheel system matrix is effective in providing frequency regulation. The cost of this system is attractive compared with today's generator-based approach. The controlled injection or absorption of reactive power, inherent to the system, extents its capability to provide voltage support. Further, fast acting control electronics allow for the damping of grid oscillations. All the above functions, once deployed in moderate numbers, could help prevent frequency and voltage shifts that have been linked to significant blackouts in recent history","","0-7803-8465-2","10.1109/PES.2004.1373235","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1373235","","Frequency control;Recycling;Flywheels;Mesh generation;Control systems;Power generation;Signal generators;Error correction;Power system management;Fossil fuels","damping;flexible AC transmission systems;flywheels;fossil fuels;frequency control;oscillations;uninterruptible power supplies;voltage control","grid frequency regulation;recycling electrical energy;network load;area control error signal;fossil fuel;hydro generators;kinetic energy storage technology;performance modeling;modular flywheel system matrix;reactive power;fast acting control electronics;damping;grid oscillations;distributed resources;energy storage;flexible AC transmission system;frequency control;renewable resources;uninterruptible power system;voltage control;60 Hz;50 Hz","","41","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Modern artificial intelligence for human-robot interaction","H. H. Lund","AdapTronics Group, Univ. of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark","Proceedings of the IEEE","","2004","92","11","1821","1838","Interaction between humans and traditional robotic systems can be problematic, as the traditional robotic systems often perform repetitive actions in a restricted environment, whereas human interaction is often characterized by novel ways of interactions, which creates an ever-changing environment. Therefore, traditional robotic system methods and technologies are often difficult to apply in situations and applications where the interaction plays a major role. So we developed a new kind of user-guided behavior-based robotics and applied this method to both mobile and humanoid robots, in order to investigate how nonexpert users could develop their own complex robot behaviors within a very short time (e.g., 30-60 min) with no prior knowledge of the robot technology. In the development of the team of humanoid robots, Viki, we used a modern approach to artificial intelligence that puts emphasis on the balance between control, electronic hardware, material, sensory system, and energy. It is possible to develop simple user interfaces with the user-guided behavior-based approach, in order to allow any user to design performances with the humanoid robots. However, we should not only look at the control of robots when designing human-robot interactions, but also on the physical aspects of the robotic system. Therefore, the novel concept of ""programming by building"" is introduced and exemplified with the creation of a prototype system consisting of building blocks with individual processing and communication capabilities. By assembling such building blocks, the user develops both the physical aspects and the functionality of the robotic system in an easy manner with no need to use a host computer or a traditional programming language. The approach is further exemplified with the implementation of neural building blocks that can later be trained by the user.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2004.835362","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1347462","","Artificial intelligence;Humanoid robots;Human robot interaction;Mobile robots;Robot sensing systems;Control systems;Robotic assembly;Hardware;User interfaces;Robot control","robots;man-machine systems;artificial intelligence;user interfaces","artificial intelligence;human-robot interaction;robotic systems;user guided behavior based robots;mobile robots;humanoid robots;robot behaviors;robot technology;electronic hardware;sensory system;user interfaces;prototype system;neural building blocks","","13","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recent studies on the capacity of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channels have focused on the effect of spatial correlation. The joint effect of spatial and temporal correlation has not been well studied. In this paper, a geometric MIMO channel model is presented, which considers motion of the receiver and nonisotropic scattering at both ends of the radio link. A joint space-time cross-correlation function is derived from this model and variates with this joint correlation are generated by using the vector autoregressive stochastic model. The outage capacity of this channel is considered where the effects of antenna spacing, antenna array angle, degree of nonisotropic scattering, and receiver motion are investigated. When n transmit and n receive antennas are employed, it is shown that the outage capacity still increases linearly with respect to n, despite the presence of spatial and temporal correlation. Furthermore, analytical expressions are derived for the ergodic capacity of a MIMO channel for the cases of spatial correlation at one end and at both ends of the radio link. The latter case does not lend itself to numerical evaluation, but the former case is shown to be accurate by comparison with simulation results. The proposed analysis is very general, as it is based on the transmit and receive antenna correlations matrices.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2004.825766","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1300858","","MIMO;Channel capacity;Receiving antennas;Receivers;Scattering;Radio link;Wireless communication;Transmitting antennas;Radio transmitters;Solid modeling","antenna arrays;MIMO systems;fading channels;radio receivers;radio transmitters;receiving antennas;transmitting antennas;radio links;multipath channels;correlation methods;stochastic processes;array signal processing","MIMO channels;wireless communication systems;multiple antennas;transmitter;receiver;single-antenna systems;multiple-input-multiple-output;spatial correlation;radio links;space-time cross-correlation function;vector autoregressive stochastic model;antenna array angle;temporal correlation;transmitting antenna;receiving antenna;ergodic capacity;multielement antenna systems;outage capacity","","101","","44","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, our algorithm extends the capability of the small-baseline subset (SBAS) technique that relies on small-baseline DIFSAR interferograms only and is mainly focused on investigating large-scale deformations with spatial resolutions of about 100/spl times/100 m. The proposed technique is implemented by using two different sets of data generated at low (multilook data) and full (single-look data) spatial resolution, respectively. The former is used to identify and estimate, via the conventional SBAS technique, large spatial scale deformation patterns, topographic errors in the available digital elevation model, and possible atmospheric phase artifacts; the latter allows us to detect, on the full-resolution residual phase components, structures highly coherent over time (buildings, rocks, lava, structures, etc.), as well as their height and displacements. In particular, the estimation of the temporal evolution of these local deformations is easily implemented by applying the singular value decomposition technique. The proposed algorithm has been tested with data acquired by the European Remote Sensing satellites relative to the Campania area (Italy) and validated by using geodetic measurements.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.828196","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1315820","","Spatial resolution;Synthetic aperture radar;Interferometry;Large-scale systems;Phase estimation;Digital elevation models;Phase detection;Buildings;Singular value decomposition;Testing","synthetic aperture radar;radiowave interferometry;radar resolution;remote sensing by radar;topography (Earth);terrain mapping;singular value decomposition","differential SAR interferometry;ground deformation;DIFSAR interferograms;small-baseline subset;large-scale deformations;spatial resolutions;multilook data;single-look data;topographic errors;digital elevation model;atmospheric phase artifacts;residual phase components;temporal evolution;singular value decomposition;European Remote Sensing satellites;geodetic measurements;synthetic aperture radar","","424","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The results indicate that the slow coherency based grouping is almost insensitive to locations and severity of the initial faults.

A detailed description of the procedure to form the islands after having determined the grouping of generators using slow coherency is presented. The verification of the islanding scheme is proven with simulations on a 179-bus, 29-generator test system.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2003.818729","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1266603","","System testing;Stability;Power system protection;Power system restoration;Relays;Power generation economics;Humans;Frequency;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Power system modeling","power system restoration;power system interconnection;power system faults;power system control;power system transient stability","slow coherency theory;islanding scheme;corrective control strategy;network conditions;loading conditions;loosely coherent generators;physical constraints;nonlinear verification;grouping","","242","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Equally, in response to this, designs for electronic surveillance measures (ESM) systems have been postulated that increase receiver sensitivity. Their purpose is to increase detection range beyond that of the radar (or to an adequate range if they are to be forward deployed). The authors examine the evolving nature of the relationship between advanced 'low probability of intercept' (LPI) radar designs and future trends in ESM receiving capability. This relationship is far from straightforward, being both probabilistic and dependent on environmental and operational factors. Indeed this is complicated still further by the issue of affordability. The authors compute the performance of ESM and radar systems for a number of cases, including not just simple interception, but also the extraction of information from intercepted signals. In this way the key factors influencing the detectability of LPI radar systems are determined. It is demonstrated that it is never possible to be completely certain that a radar system has not been detected and that the most appropriate way to implement an LPI radar design is always closely related to the tactical environment in which the radar system will be used. Indeed this often overrides the technical aspects of system performance.","1350-2395","","10.1049/ip-rsn:20041056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1356817","","","radar detection;search radar;environmental factors;radio receivers","low probability;intercept radar strategy;radar transmission;electronic surveillance measures system;receiver sensitivity;radar detection;radar design;environmental operational factor","","28","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals"

Several design examples are considered where fractal trees are used as end-loads in order to miniaturize conventional dipole or monopole antennas.

Proceedings","","2004","","","502","508","TAN resistors are commonly used in RFIC applications and are gaining acceptance in traditional CMOS designs. TAN materials, frequently used in fabrication of Cu interconnects can easily be applied to the fabrication of thin film resistors. Deposition and integration of the films may be well controlled to produce a high precision resistor, and the temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) characteristics of the film make it ideally suited for application across a large temperature range. While the time zero characteristics of the device are well understood, of equal importance are the device reliability properties. In this paper traditional film characteristics such as resistance distributions and TCR characteristics are presented. A voltage ramp stress is employed to identify the critical current A constant voltage stress at high temperature is utilized for reliability evaluation. Based on the stress results, a reliability degradation model is derived to express the relationship between stress condition, resistance change, and lifetime. The results demonstrate that the TAN thin film resistor is reliable over traditional IC operating ranges. While TAN resistors are robust, application conditions of the resistor typically result in significant resistive joule heating. The joule heating effects on the resistor are included in the resistor degradation model. The effects of the joule heating on reliability for neighboring structures must also be considered. The effective result is that the maximum allowed use current of the resistor might be dictated by the resistive joule heating and not necessarily the resistor reliability itself. The effect of the joule heating on neighboring structures is a subject itself and will not be covered in this paper.","","0-7803-8315-X","10.1109/RELPHY.2004.1315380","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1315380","","Transistors;Resistors;Heating;Stress;Fabrication;Temperature distribution;Voltage;Degradation;Radiofrequency integrated circuits;Temperature control","tantalum compounds;CMOS integrated circuits;resistors;copper;integrated circuit interconnections","TaN thin film resistors;RFIC applications;CMOS designs;Cu interconnects;high precision resistor;temperature coefficient of resistance characteristics;voltage ramp stress;critical current;constant voltage stress;reliability evaluation;reliability degradation model;joule heating effects;TaN","","16","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the successively launching of high-resolution commercial satellites (e.g. IKONOS and QuickBird), high-resolution satellite imagery has been shown to be a cost-effective alternative to aerial photography in many applications. Drawing on the traditional building extraction approach, this paper proposes an algorithm to extract urban building from high-resolution panchromatic QuickBird image using clustering and edge detection. In the first step, an unsupervised clustering by histogram peak selection is used to split the image into a number of classes. The shadows of building are extracted from the lowest gray class. In the second step, the shadows are used as one of the evidences to verify the presence of buildings. Thus, the candidate building objects are extracted from the clustering classes except for the shadow class. Finally, to refine building boundary and further exclude some false building objects, the Canny operator is applied to detect edge of the candidate building objects in the PAN image. From the Hough transform of the detected edges, the main lines, which compose the polyhedral description of the building, can be found. The building extraction results are compared with manually delineated results.

Superconducting power components can also contribute to improved power quality and increased system reliability. This paper addresses historical developments and technology status of four superconducting power applications: cables, superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES), fault-current limiters, and transformers. Today, SMES is the only fully functional superconducting system and it has seen only limited use at grid power levels. A few model or demonstration units exist for each of the other three applications. Superconductivity faces several hurdles on the path to widespread use. Perhaps the most important is the need for operating voltages of 100 kV or more. Though progress in this and other areas has been rapid, considerable development is needed before superconducting devices perform reliably in the utility environment. As a result, today, most initial installations are aimed at niche applications and will be installed where space is limited, where power demands are increasing over existing corridors, and/or where initial development costs can be offset by enhanced power grid performance.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2004.833674","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1335555","","Superconductivity;Superconducting magnetic energy storage;Superconducting transmission lines;Superconducting cables;Samarium;Power quality;Reliability;Transformers;Power system modeling;Voltage","high-temperature superconductors;superconducting transformers;power transformers;superconducting magnet energy storage;fault current limiters;superconducting cables","electric power applications;electric power;superconductivity;superconducting power components;power quality;system reliability;superconducting cables;SMES;superconducting magnetic energy storage;fault current limiters;transformers;grid power levels;operating voltages;power grid performance;100 kV","","106","","75","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Zerubia","Ist. di Scienza e Technologie delta Informazione, CNR, Pisa, Italy; NA","IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","","2004","13","4","527","533","Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has found important applications due to its clear advantages over optical satellite imagery one of them being able to operate in various weather conditions. However, due to the physics of the radar imaging process, SAR images contain unwanted artifacts in the form of a granular look which is called speckle. The assumptions of the classical SAR image generation model lead to a Rayleigh distribution model for the histogram of the SAR image. However, some experimental data such as images of urban areas show impulsive characteristics that correspond to underlying heavy-tailed distributions, which are clearly non-Rayleigh. Some alternative distributions have been suggested such as the Weibull, log-normal, and the k-distribution which had success in varying degrees depending on the application. Recently, an alternative model namely the /spl alpha/-stable distribution has been suggested for modeling radar clutter. In this paper, we show that the amplitude distribution of the complex wave, the real and the imaginery components of which are assumed to be distributed by the /spl alpha/-stable distribution, is a generalization of the Rayleigh distribution. We demonstrate that the amplitude distribution is a mixture of Rayleighs as is the k-distribution in accordance with earlier work on modeling SAR images which showed that almost all successful SAR image models could be expressed as mixtures of Rayleighs. We also present parameter estimation techniques based on negative order moments for the new model. Finally, we test the performance of the model on urban images and compare with other models such as Rayleigh, Weibull, and the k-distribution.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2003.818017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1284389","","Synthetic aperture radar;Adaptive optics;Laser radar;Satellites;Physics;Radar imaging;Speckle;Image generation;Histograms;Urban areas","synthetic aperture radar;radar imaging;radar clutter;speckle;parameter estimation;Weibull distribution","synthetic aperture radar images;SAR;radar imaging process;speckle;SAR image generation model;heavy-tailed Rayleigh distribution;histogram;amplitude distribution;/spl alpha/-stable distribution;k-distribution;parameter estimation;negative order moments;urban images;Weibull distribution;radar clutter","","142","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, these methods usually rely on a huge training database (around 5,000 positive examples for good performance). While such huge databases may be feasible for building a system that detects a single object, it is obviously problematic for scenarios where multiple objects (or multiple views of a single object) need to be detected. Indeed, even for multi-viewface detection the performance of existing systems is far from satisfactory. In this work we focus on the problem of learning to detect objects from a small training database. We show that performance depends crucially on the features that are used to represent the objects. Specifically, we show that using local edge orientation histograms (EOH) as features can significantly improve performance compared to the standard linear features used in existing systems. For frontal faces, local orientation histograms enable state of the art performance using only a few hundred training examples. For profile view faces, local orientation histograms enable learning a system that seems to outperform the state of the art in real-time systems even with a small number of training examples.","1063-6919","0-7695-2158-4","10.1109/CVPR.2004.1315144","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1315144","","Object detection;Face detection;Spatial databases;Histograms;Real time systems;Testing;Filters;Computer science;Object oriented databases;Image edge detection","face recognition;real-time systems;visual databases;very large databases;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection","object detection;face detection systems;edge orientation histograms;real-time systems;training database","","191","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The two most common distance metrics in hyperspectral processing are the spectral angle mapper (SAM) and the Euclidean minimum distance (EMD), and each metric possesses distinct mathematical and physical properties. In this paper, we enumerate the characteristics of both metrics, and, based on an exact decomposition of SAM, we derive a technique called band add-on (BAO) that iteratively selects bands to increase the angular separation between two spectra. Unlike other feature selection algorithms, BAO exploits a mathematical decomposition of SAM to incrementally add bands. We extend BAO to the more practical problem of increasing the angular separability between two classes of spectra. This scenario parallels the material identification problem where quite often only a small number (<10) of ground-truth measurements are collected for each material class, and statistical classification methods are inapplicable. Two algorithms for selecting bands and class templates are presented to increase the angular separation between two classes. The techniques are compared with several other metric-based approaches in binary discrimination tests with real data. The results demonstrate that band selection can improve the discrimination of very similar targets, while using only a fraction of the available spectral bands.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.830549","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1315839","","Hyperspectral sensors;Hyperspectral imaging;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wavelength measurement;Sensor systems;Software libraries;Atmospheric measurements;Algorithm design and analysis;Iterative algorithms;Testing","remote sensing;image classification;data compression;feature extraction;spectral analysis;geophysical signal processing","band selection;image classification;image compression;image detection;dimension reduction;distance metrics;material identification;spectral libraries;hyperspectral processing;spectral angle mapper;Euclidean minimum distance;band add-on;angular separation;feature selection algorithms","","199","","55","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A state-space formulation for a system model that incorporates motor electrical dynamics is obtained with the assist motor angular position as the output. Second, linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and Kalman filter techniques are employed to arrive at an optimal controller for the EPAS system. The selection of weighting coefficients for the LQR cost function is discussed.

However, much to our surprise, the reduced model was found to have good classification accuracy for several commonly used data sets from the Web. In this paper, we extend the single output model to a multiple outputs model to handle multiple class problems. The method is particularly suitable for problems with small number of features and large number of examples. The basic component of this polynomial model boils down to construction of new pattern features which are sums of the original features and combination of these new and original features using power and product terms. A linear regularized least-squares predictor is then built using these constructed features. The number of constructed feature terms varies linearly with the order of the polynomial, instead of having a power law in the case of full multivariate polynomials. The method is simple as it amounts to only a few lines of Matlab code. We perform extensive experiments on this reduced model using 42 data sets. Our results compared remarkably well with best reported results of several commonly used algorithms from the literature. Both the classification accuracy and efficiency aspects are reported for this reduced model.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2004.3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1288524","Pattern classification;parameter estimation;pattern recognition;multivariate polynomials;and machine learning.","Polynomials;Mathematical model;Parameter estimation;Character recognition;Speech recognition;Pattern classification;Biometrics;Machine learning algorithms;Pattern recognition;Machine learning","pattern classification;learning (artificial intelligence);parameter estimation;polynomials;least squares approximations","benchmarking;reduced multivariate polynomial pattern classifier;biometric decision fusion;classification accuracy;multiple outputs model;pattern features;power terms;product terms;linear regularized least-squares predictor;parameter estimation;pattern recognition;machine learning","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Benchmarking;Decision Support Techniques;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Statistical;Multivariate Analysis;Pattern Recognition, Automated","91","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

National Power and Energy Conference, 2004.","","2004","","","175","179","The sub-system interaction and instability phenomena is a common problem in the distributed power system (DPS). The interaction arises because each individual converter has internal control function such as to regulate the converter output voltage, which results in the converter tends to draw a constant power and therefore has a negative incremental input impedance. The constant power and negative input resistance characteristic potentially have a de-stabilizing effect on the electrical supply system. The paper presents the analysis, theoretical design and simulation of a simple DC DPS. The analysis of the LC filter and its damping parameters were given. The effect of the negative input resistance of the CPL on the filter was analysed using small-signal input resistance of the load. The passive damping method was used to reduce the system interaction between the converters. The results were verified by MATLAB Simulink simulation.","","0-7803-8724-4","10.1109/PECON.2004.1461638","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1461638","","Voltage control;Impedance;RLC circuits;Hybrid power systems;Regulators;Electric resistance;Damping;Frequency;Power systems;Power system simulation","load (electric);distribution networks;power convertors;voltage control;stability;power filters","constant power loads;instability effect;distributed power system;converter;output voltage regulation;electrical supply system;negative input resistance;LC filter;small-signal input resistance;MATLAB;Simulink simulation;passive damping method;system interaction reduction","","34","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The reflectarray consists of three layers of rectangular patch arrays backed by a ground plane. The phase of the reflection coefficient for both linear polarizations is controlled at each reflective element by adjusting the patch dimensions. To overcome the frequency band limitation of reflectarrays, the patch dimensions are adjusted to match the required phase distribution and its variation with frequency. A phase-only synthesis technique based on the intersection approach has been applied to obtain the phase distribution on the reflectarray surface. An experimental demonstration is presented by means of a medium-size two-layer reflectarray that radiates two pencil beams separated by 55/spl deg/. An 80-cm three-layer reflectarray has been designed for typical South America DBS coverage at Ku-band for dual polarization. After the optimization of the patch dimensions to match the phase distribution in the 12.8-14.2 GHz band significant improvements have been achieved in the contoured patterns.

As the computation of such metrics is complicated by their nonlinear and combinatorial nature, we introduce the notion of hybrid metrics based on the probabilities of loss-of-load due to single and double generation outages only. The reliability-constrained market-clearing problem can then be formulated as a mixed-integer linear program and solved with large-scale commercial solvers.

At higher switching frequencies, and either low power or high voltage applications, the effect of the gate-driver on the overall converter performance becomes even more pronounced. When considering a gate-driver for a power electronic system, the converter topology, operating conditions and requirements, voltage and current ratings, and switching frequency determines the suitability and applicability of a chosen gate-driver to the application. This paper discusses different gate-drivers, represented by three fundamental gate-driver topologies that are evaluated in terms of suitable operating conditions, construction and losses. These gate-drivers, constructed using two different methods, a hybrid and SMD, also forms part of the evaluation. In addition, some of the issues as switching frequencies keep increasing is also addressed.","","0-7803-8269-2","10.1109/APEC.2004.1295951","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1295951","","Voltage;Switching frequency;Switching converters;Circuit topology;Power electronics;Resonance;Rectifiers;Power conversion;Laboratories;Design engineering","power convertors;surface mount technology;constant current sources;driver circuits;network topology","high frequency applications;resonant gate-driver topologies;power electronic converters;voltage stresses;switching devices;converter performance;converter topology;current source topology;switching frequencies;voltage source topology","","32","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

FIRST can handle exemplar-based, graphical-sketch-based, as well as linguistic queries involving region labels, attributes, and spatial relations. FIRST uses fuzzy attributed relational graphs (FARGs) to represent images, where each node in the graph represents an image region and each edge represents a relation between two regions. The given query is converted to a FARG, and a low-complexity fuzzy graph matching algorithm is used to compare the query graph with the FARGs in the database. The use of an indexing scheme based on a leader clustering algorithm avoids an exhaustive search of the FARG database. We quantify the retrieval performance of the system in terms of several standard measures.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2004.53","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1324628","Index Terms- Content-based image retrieval;fuzzy graph models;graph matching;graph clustering;indexing.","Image retrieval;Content based retrieval;Fuzzy set theory;Clustering algorithms;Image representation;Feedback;Fuzzy systems;Image converters;Image databases;Indexing","content-based retrieval;image retrieval;image representation;fuzzy set theory;fuzzy systems;graph theory;image matching;visual databases;indexing;linguistics","content-based image retrieval system;image representation;similarity measure;relevance feedback;fuzzy set theory;fuzzy image retrieval system;FIRST;linguistic queries;fuzzy attributed relational graph;image region;fuzzy graph matching algorithm;indexing;leader clustering algorithm;FARG database;graph clustering","","67","","70","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Its reliability and performance remain of great importance to the utilities. Irrespective of the failure rate, transformers are also of high concern from the point of asset management. Sudden failure of a large transformer may cause interruption in power supply resulting in a high repair costs, revenue losses as well as environmental and collateral damages. Transformer operating with load and ambient temperature higher then its design characteristics accelerates the aging process and involves high risk of catastrophic failures. Over voltages and short circuits have also a significant contribution towards transformer deterioration. Condition based maintenance (CBM) is an important tool in the asset management that would allow the transformer to operate according to its actual practicable efficiency. Better transformer management could be achieved with online monitoring, routine diagnostics, and CBM. Total life cycle cost including routine maintenance, reconditioning, major refurbishment and condition monitoring stands important for strategic, economic and technical assessment as well as asset management strategies. Transformer's performance, reliability and technical life can be increased with the implementation of correct operational criteria (condition based) and management strategies.

Sensors reviewed include both research and commercial devices that can noninvasively detect extracellular metabolites, including oxygen, carbon dioxide, and glucose.

Performance metrics, such as sensitivity, sensor size, drift, time response, and sensing range, are included when available. Highly suitable sensor technologies for monitoring cellular metabolic activity include electrochemical sensors, scanning electrochemical microscopy, ion-sensitive field effect transistor sensors, and solid-state light-addressable potentiometric sensors.

The considered formulation requires the optimization of two different objectives; therefore the use of adequate multiobjective heuristic optimization methods is needed. The heuristic strategy used for the optimization is based on fuzzy sets theory. After a brief description of the general problem of optimal control of voltage and power losses in automated distribution networks, the most recent papers on the topic are reported and commented.

The introduced CrowdingDE algorithm is compared with a DE using the well-known sharing scheme that penalizes similar candidate solutions. In conclusion, the introduced CrowdingDE outperformed the sharing-based DE algorithm on fourteen commonly used benchmark problems.","","0-7803-8515-2","10.1109/CEC.2004.1331058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1331058","","Evolutionary computation;Bioinformatics;Genetic programming;Genetic algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Hamming distance;Euclidean distance;Encoding","evolutionary computation","multimodal optimization;crowding-based differential evolution;evolutionary computation;differential evolution algorithm;crowding scheme;CrowdingDE algorithm;sharing-based DE algorithm","","163","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The radiating patch element of a planar antenna is replaced by a solar cell. Furthermore radiating slots are built due to the cell spacing in a solar cell array. The original feature of a solar cell (DC current generation) remains, but additionally the solar cell is now able to receive and transmit electromagnetic waves. Both single solar cells as well as solar cell arrays can be used as antennas. At first some basics regarding the RF properties of solar cell patches are discussed. The efficiency of solar cell antennas is measured by means of the Wheeler Cap method, which is investigated by means of numerical simulations. The lossy substrate of the feed lines has the strongest influence on the antenna efficiency. Finally two applications are presented: a solar cell GPS antenna for vehicular applications and a solar cell slot antenna for mobile communications (GSM). The aim is to integrate these antennas into vehicular glass roofs which are covered with photovoltaic solar cells in order to deliver the electric power for the indoor ventilation of the car. The GPS antenna provides circular polarisation and a main lobe in zenith direction whereas the GSM antenna is vertically polarized and has a monopole-like radiation pattern. Both antennas are built up with commonly used solar cells. The comparison of measured and simulated antenna properties shows a good agreement.","","0-7803-8523-3","10.1109/PIMRC.2004.1370945","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1370945","","Planar arrays;Photovoltaic systems;Solar power generation;Photovoltaic cells;Mobile communication;Antenna measurements;Global Positioning System;Mobile antennas;Slot antennas;GSM","planar antenna arrays;mobile antennas;microstrip antenna arrays;numerical analysis;antenna feeds;Global Positioning System;cellular radio;antenna radiation patterns;mobile radio;receiving antennas;transmitting antennas;solar cell arrays","planar antennas;photovoltaic solar cells;mobile communications;PV solar cells;radiating slots;cell spacing;receiving antennas;transmitting antennas;solar cell arrays;RF properties;solar cell patches;Wheeler Cap method;numerical simulations;lossy substrate;feed lines;antenna efficiency;GPS antenna;GSM;vehicular glass roofs;DC current generation;indoor ventilation;circular polarisation;zenith direction main lobe;vertical polarization;monopole-like radiation pattern","","19","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An interleaved subcarrier-assignment scheme is preferred because it provides maximum frequency diversity and increases the capacity in frequency-selective fading channels. The subcarriers are overlapping, but orthogonal to each other such that there is no intercarrier interference (ICI). Carrier-frequency offsets (CFOs) between the transmitter and the receiver destroy the orthogonality and introduces ICI, resulting in multiple-access interference. This paper exploits the inner structure of the signals for CFO estimation in the uplink of interleaved OFDMA systems. A new uplink signal model is presented, and an estimation algorithm based on the signal structure is proposed for estimating the CFOs of all users using only one OFDMA block. Diversity schemes are also presented to improve the estimation performance.

This paper addresses the problem of coherent/fully correlated source localization using vector sensor arrays. The maximum likelihood (ML) and minimum-variance distortionless response (MVDR) estimators for source direction-of-arrival (DOA) and signal polarization parameters are derived. These estimators require no search over the polarization parameters. In addition, a novel method for ""decorrelating"" the incident signals is presented. This method is based on the polarization smoothing algorithm (PSA) and enables the use of eigenstructure-based techniques, which assume uncorrelated or partially correlated signals. The method is implemented as a preprocessing stage before applying eigenstructure-based techniques, such as MUSIC. Unlike other existing preprocessing techniques, such as spatial smoothing and forward-backward (FB) averaging, this method is not limited to any specific array geometry. The performance of the proposed PSA preprocessing combined with MUSIC is evaluated and compared to the Crame/spl acute/r-Rao Bound (CRB) and the ML and MVDR estimators. Simulation results show that the MVDR and PSA-MUSIC asymptotically achieve the CRB for a scenario with two coherent sources with and without an uncorrelated interference source. A sensitivity study of PSA-MUSIC to source polarization was also conducted via simulations.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2004.836456","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1344459","","Sensor arrays;Polarization;Maximum likelihood estimation;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Smoothing methods;Multiple signal classification;Distortion;Direction of arrival estimation;Decorrelation;Geometry","array signal processing;maximum likelihood estimation;direction-of-arrival estimation;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;smoothing methods;electromagnetic wave propagation;electromagnetic wave polarisation","source localization;vector sensor array;multipath propagation effect;maximum likelihood estimation;minimum-variance distortionless response estimator;MVDR;source direction-of-arrival;signal polarization parameter;polarization smoothing algorithm;eigenstructure-based techniques;partially correlated signals;MUSIC;Cramer-Rao bound;uncorrelated interference source;DOA","","99","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper discusses the design and implementation of a low-cost filterless class-D, unipolar pulse-width modulation switching audio amplifier having a multi-loop voltage feedback scheme. Classical frequency-compensation techniques are used to design and stabilize the three voltage feedback loops implemented in this application. This design method proves to be a cost-effective solution for designing high-fidelity (hi-fi) audio amplifiers. The cost is reduced because no output filter is used, the required switching frequency is half of the one needed if bipolar PWM was used, and no current sensor is needed for feedback purposes. The output impedance is extremely low due to the reduction of the successive voltage loops, making the amplifier less load dependent. Simulation results show that a total harmonic distortion (THD) of 0.005% can be achieved using this topology, as well as a flat frequency response, free of phase distortion in the audio band. Experimental results show the feasibility of this control scheme, since a THD of 0.05% was achieved with a laboratory prototyped amplifier. A comparison of the performance of this audio amplifier with that of some commercial class-D audio amplifiers, reveals that our design can seriously compete with some of the ICs leading the market at a lower cost.","1558-4127","","10.1109/TCE.2004.1277879","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1277879","","Pulse amplifiers;Voltage;Costs;Pulse width modulation;Power amplifiers;Space vector pulse width modulation;Pulse modulation;Frequency;Feedback loop;Design methodology","feedback amplifiers;power amplifiers;audio-frequency amplifiers;Hi-Fi equipment;pulse width modulation;harmonic distortion","multiloop voltage feedback;filterless class-D switching audio amplifier;unipolar pulse-width-modulation;frequency-compensation technique;high-fidelity audio amplifier;bipolar PWM;voltage loop;total harmonic distortion;phase distortion;feedback amplifiers;audio amplifiers;amplifier distortion;switching amplifier;current sensor","","37","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Steerable filters provide robustness to lighting changes and shadows and perform well in picking out both circular reflector road markings as well as painted line road markings. The filter results are then processed to eliminate outliers based on the expected road geometry and used to update a road and vehicular model along with data taken internally from the vehicles. Results are shown for a 9000-frame image sequence that include varying lane markings, lighting conditions, showing, and occlusion by other vehicles.","","0-7803-8310-9","10.1109/IVS.2004.1336440","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1336440","","Robustness;Filters;Road vehicles;Remotely operated vehicles;Road transportation;Vehicle detection;Detectors;Computer vision;Vehicle driving;Mobile robots","driver information systems;roads;road vehicles;image sequences;filtering theory;geometry","lane marking detection;lane tracking;steerable filters;robustness;circular reflector road markings;painted line road markings;road geometry;vehicular model;road model;image sequence","","73","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is seen that the mutual information increases with the. number of antennas, but is limited by channel estimation error at high SNR. We also derive tight lower bounds of ergodic and outage capacities and optimal transmitter power allocation strategies that achieve the bounds. For the ergodic capacity, the optimal strategy is a modified waterfilling over the spatial (subchannel) and temporal (fading) domain. For the outage capacity, it is a spatial waterfilling and temporal truncated channel inversion. Numerical results show that some capacity gain is obtained by spatial power allocation. Temporal power adaptation, on the other hand, gives negligible gain in terms of ergodic capacity, but greatly enhances outage performance.","","0-7803-8533-0","10.1109/ICC.2004.1312613","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1312613","","Fading;MIMO;Channel estimation;Mutual information;Upper bound;Transmitters;Power system modeling;Additive white noise;AWGN;Channel capacity","channel estimation;MIMO systems;Rayleigh channels;optimisation;transmitting antennas;Gaussian channels;radio transmitters;channel capacity","fading MIMO channels;channel estimation error;multiple input multiple output systems;Rayleigh flat-fading channels;Gaussian inputs;SNR;signal-to-noise ratio;optimal transmitter power allocation strategies;ergodic capacity;outage capacity;temporal truncated channel inversion;spatial power allocation;temporal power adaptation","","25","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These studies have not addressed why people rate typefaces differently across personality attributes. We report findings from a survey that gathered both quantitative and qualitative data. We asked writing students to rate 15 typefaces on 10 personality attributes (e.g., ""artistic"") using 1-7 Likert scales. We also gathered qualitative data by soliciting written comments about the typeface ratings. We posed two research questions: 1) What personalities do different typefaces have, according to participants' assessments? and 2) How do participants explain their ratings of typeface personality, i.e,, why do they assess particular typefaces to have particular personalities? It is hoped that this study, combined with future research on the anatomical features of typefaces, will help technical communicators analyze typefaces so that they can make informed decisions when choosing typefaces for their documents.","","0-7803-8467-9","10.1109/IPCC.2004.1375315","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1375315","","Displays;Mood;Writing;Shape","text analysis","typefaces;personality attributes;typeface ratings;typography","","9","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Interestingly, the experimental results show that the ELM algorithm for RBF networks can complete learning at extremely fast speed and produce generalization performance very close to that of SVM in many artificial and real benchmarking function approximation and classification problems.

The receiver has perfect channel state information (CSI), while the transmitter has different types of CSI, i.e., either perfect CSI, or no CSI, or long-term knowledge of the channel covariance matrix. For the case in which the transmitter knows the channel covariance matrix, it was recently shown that the optimal eigenvectors of the transmit covariance matrix correspond with the eigenvectors of the channel covariance matrix. However, the optimal eigenvalues are difficult to compute. We derive a characterization of the optimum power allocation. Furthermore, we apply this result to provide an efficient algorithm which computes the optimum power allocation. In addition to this, we analyze the impact of correlation on the ergodic capacity of the MISO system with different CSI schemes. At first, we justify the belief that equal power allocation is optimal if the transmitter is uninformed and the transmit antennas are correlated. Next, we show that the ergodic capacity with perfect CSI and without CSI at the transmitter is Schur-concave, i.e., the more correlated the transmit antennas are, the less capacity is achievable. In addition, we show that the ergodic capacity with covariance knowledge at the transmitter is Schur-convex with respect to the correlation properties. These results completely characterize the impact of correlation on the ergodic capacity in MISO systems. Furthermore, the capacity loss or gain due to correlation is quantified. For no CSI and perfect CSI at the transmitter, the capacity loss due to correlation is bounded by some small constant, whereas the capacity gain due to correlation grows unbounded with the number of transmit antennas in the case in which transmitter knows the channel covariance matrix. Finally, we illustrate all theoretical results by numerical simulations.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2004.837415","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1356239","Beamforming;capacity;channel state information;covariance feedback;multiple-antenna systyems;power allocation;spatial correlation","Channel state information;Transmitters;Covariance matrix;Transmitting antennas;Feedback;Wireless communication;Fading;Mutual information;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Propagation losses","antenna arrays;radio links;covariance matrices;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;transmitting antennas;telecommunication channels;radio transmitters;radio receivers;correlation methods","optimal transmission strategy;multiantenna system;channel state information;multiple-input single-output wireless communication link;channel covariance matrix;optimal eigenvector;optimum power allocation;MISO system;transmitting antenna;Schur-concave","","94","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Denoising functional MR images: a comparison of wavelet denoising and Gaussian smoothing","A. M. Wink; J. B. T. M. Roerdink","Inst. for Math., Univ. of Groningen, Netherlands; NA","IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","","2004","23","3","374","387","We present a general wavelet-based denoising scheme for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and compare it to Gaussian smoothing, the traditional denoising method used in fMRI analysis. One-dimensional WaveLab thresholding routines were adapted to two-dimensional (2-D) images, and applied to 2-D wavelet coefficients. To test the effect of these methods on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we compared the SNR of 2-D fMRI images before and after denoising, using both Gaussian smoothing and wavelet-based methods. We simulated a fMRI series with a time signal in an active spot, and tested the methods on noisy copies of it. The denoising methods were evaluated in two ways: by the average temporal SNR inside the original activated spot, and by the shape of the spot detected by thresholding the temporal SNR maps. Denoising methods that introduce much smoothness are better suited for low SNRs, but for images of reasonable quality they are not preferable, because they introduce heavy deformations. Wavelet-based denoising methods that introduce less smoothing preserve the sharpness of the images and retain the original shapes of active regions. We also performed statistical parametric mapping on the denoised simulated time series, as well as on a real fMRI data set. False discovery rate control was used to correct for multiple comparisons. The results show that the methods that produce smooth images introduce more false positives. The less smoothing wavelet-based methods, although generating more false negatives, produce a smaller total number of errors than Gaussian smoothing or wavelet-based methods with a large smoothing effect.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2004.824234","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269883","","Noise reduction;Smoothing methods;Two dimensional displays;Testing;Shape;Waves;Magnetic resonance imaging;Image analysis;Magnetic analysis;Wavelet coefficients","biomedical MRI;image enhancement;image denoising;statistical analysis;smoothing methods;wavelet transforms;medical image processing","image denoising;functional magnetic resonance imaging;fMRI;Gaussian smoothing;WaveLab;wavelet coefficients;signal-to-noise ratio;SNR;image sharpness;statistical parametric mapping;false discovery rate control","Algorithms;Brain;Brain Mapping;Humans;Image Enhancement;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Normal Distribution;Quality Control;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Stochastic Processes","153","","41","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The multiagent systems are used in traffic data management with full consideration of the characteristics of traffic data and the cooperation and workflow among them. In software implementation of data management, the agent-based common object request broker architecture is adopted taking the distributed urban traffic data in the large area under network environments into account. Based on the global traffic data, the approach of visualized spatial-temporal analysis is then induced. The similarity of traffic data is analyzed first for each link and its profile is achieved to undertake the primary processing of urban traffic data. Furthermore, analysis results are shown on the basis of the geographic information systems for transportation. The two types of visualization, pseudocolor and contour maps, are adopted in the demonstration to display the traffic status graphically and its changing frames.

In future CMOS technology generations, supply and threshold voltages will have to continually scale to sustain performance increase, control switching power dissipation, and maintain reliability. These continual scaling requirements on supply and threshold voltages pose several technology and circuit design challenges. With threshold voltage scaling, subthreshold leakage power is expected to become a significant portion of the total power in future CMOS systems. Therefore, it becomes crucial to predict and reduce subthreshold leakage power of such systems. In the first part of this paper, we present a subthreshold leakage power prediction model that takes into account within-die threshold voltage variation. Statistical measurements of 32-bit microprocessors in 0.18-/spl mu/m CMOS confirm that the mean error of the model is 4%. In the second part of this paper, we present the use of stacked devices to reduce system subthreshold leakage power without reducing system performance. A model to predict the scaling nature of this stack effect and verification of the model through statistical device measurements in 0.18-/spl mu/m and 0.13-/spl mu/m are presented.

Extensive research has been devoted to the development of cryptographic algorithms that provide the theoretical underpinnings of information security. Functional security mechanisms, such as security protocols, suitably employ these mathematical primitives in order to achieve the desired security objectives. However, functional security mechanisms alone cannot ensure security, since most embedded systems present attackers with an abundance of opportunities to observe or interfere with their implementation, and hence to compromise their theoretical strength. This paper surveys various tamper or attack techniques, and explains how they can be used to undermine or weaken security functions in embedded systems. Tamper-resistant design refers to the process of designing a system architecture and implementation that is resistant to such attacks.

Stability and robustness criteria are presented. The variable-frequency predictive control obviates the need for current-loop compensation and has the advantages of single-cycle response and relatively simple implementation.

Statistical iterative reconstruction with accurate modeling of the noise, rather than a filtered back-projection (FBP) with low-pass filtering, is one way to deal with the problem. Estimating a noise-free sinogram to satisfy the FBP reconstruction for the Radon transform is another way. The benefits of the latter include a higher computation efficiency, more uniform spatial resolution in the reconstructed image, and less modification of the current machine configurations. In a clinic X-ray CT system, the acquired raw data must be calibrated, in addition to the logarithmic transform, to achieve the high diagnostic image quality. The calibrated projection data or sinogram no longer follow a compound Poisson distribution in general, but are close to a Gaussian distribution with signal-dependent variance. In this paper, we first investigated a relatively accurate statistical model for the sinogram data, based on several phantom experiments. Then we developed a penalized likelihood method to smooth the sinogram, which led to a set of nonlinear equations that can be solved by iterated conditional mode (ICM) algorithm within a reasonable computing time. The method was applied to several experimental datasets acquired at 120 kVp, 10 mA/20 mA/50 mA protocols with a GE HiSpeed multi-slice detector CT scanner and demonstrated a significant noise suppression without noticeable sacrifice of the spatial resolution.","1558-1578","","10.1109/TNS.2004.834824","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1344369","","Smoothing methods;Computed tomography;Image reconstruction;X-ray imaging;Low pass filters;Spatial resolution;Optical imaging;Filtering;Image quality;Gaussian distribution","computerised tomography;dosimetry;quantum noise;image reconstruction;iterative methods;low-pass filters;Radon transforms;Gaussian distribution;phantoms;nonlinear equations","quantum noise;low dose X-ray CT imaging;statistical properties;image reconstruction;statistical iterative reconstruction;filtered back-projection;low-pass filtering;noise-free sinogram;Radon transform;computation efficiency;spatial resolution;reconstructed image;current machine configurations;clinic X-ray CT system;logarithmic transform;high diagnostic image quality;calibrated projection data;compound Poisson distribution;Gaussian distribution;signal-dependent variance;relatively accurate statistical model;phantom experiments;penalized likelihood method;nonlinear equations;iterated conditional mode algorithm;computing time;protocols;GE HiSpeed multislice detector CT scanner;noise suppression;penalized weighted least square;nonlinear sinogram smoothing","","180","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on these observations, we propose the use of pin reordering as a means to reduce I/sub gate/.

IEEE SECON 2004.","","2004","","","309","316","In this paper, we study two problems of providing reliable data transmission and developing aggregation techniques for correlated data in wireless sensor networks. A system with forward error correction (FEC) can provide an objective reliability while using less transmission power than a system without FEC. Because of the additional parity bits and encoding/decoding energy consumptions, we study the effect of FEC on energy efficiency. We propose to use LDPC codes for FEC. We show that wireless sensor networks using LDPC codes are almost 45% more energy efficient than those that use BCH codes, which were shown to be 15% more energy efficient than the best performing convolutional codes. Then we study the problem of providing aggregation for two and three correlated nodes in wireless sensor networks. We propose to use LDPC codes in wireless sensor networks for source and channel coding to obtain a two-fold energy savings. For two correlated nodes, we study both distributed source coding and joint source-channel coding. While distributed source coding using LDPC codes was studied before, joint source-channel coding using LDPC codes is introduced for the first time. The difference between our work in distributed source coding using LDPC codes and the previous work lies in the LDPC code design procedure. The simulation results show that our proposed design criteria improves the performance of the source coding. The convergence of the non-uniform LDPC code of our design technique is almost 60% closer to the Slepian-Wolf limit. For three correlated nodes, we study distributed source coding using LDPC codes. We simplified the problem of design procedure to randomly punctured LDPC codes. This is a new approach for designing LDPC codes and the simulation results for code of length 1000 shows that the convergence of the LDPC code is achieved at compression rate 0.3174 which is only 0.08 away from the Slepian-Wolf limit.","","0-7803-8796-1","10.1109/SAHCN.2004.1381931","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1381931","","Channel coding;Wireless sensor networks;Parity check codes;Forward error correction;Source coding;Power system reliability;Energy efficiency;Convergence;Data communication;Decoding","wireless sensor networks;parity check codes;forward error correction;error correction codes;convolutional codes;combined source-channel coding;convergence;BCH codes;data compression","channel coding;wireless sensor network;LDPC code;aggregation technique;forward error correction code;convolutional code;joint source-channel coding;convergence;distributed source coding","","46","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Interestingly, with only minor modification the same hardware needed to implement a 4PAM system can be used to implement a loop-unrolled single-tap DFE receiver. To get the maximum performance from either technique, the link has to be tuned to match the specific channel it is driving. Adaptive equalization using data based update filtering allows continuous updates while minimizing the required sampler front-end hardware and significantly reduces the cost of implementation in multi-level signaling schemes.

Future more, if multiple faults occur in different phases and each phase have only one fault switch, the proposed design can still conditionally provide consistent voltage converting levels.

Fairly accurate design procedures giving equivalent-circuit information are well known for bandpass filters, but this data needs to be converted into physical dimensions, i.e., waveguide cavity lengths and iris dimensions. A novel procedure giving dimensions of bandpass filters directly for wide- and narrow-band applications is described. Iris network models are generated with the aid of electromagnetic simulators and used to derive correct iris dimensions and accurate susceptance slope parameters of the cavities, avoiding global optimization of the entire structure. The results demonstrate very good equiripple performance up to bandwidths of approximately 20% in frequency or 40% in terms of guide wavelength. A similar dimensional synthesis to design waveguide noncontiguous bandpass diplexers is also given. The method uses a fast and efficient optimization with a reduced number of variables, which is fixed and independent of the order of the two filters. The simplicity of the method leads to good return-loss levels and the derivation of the diplexer dimensions takes less than 10 min, including optimization.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2004.837146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1353531","Computer-aided design;dimensional synthesis;impedance inverters;network theory;optimization;waveguide diplexers;waveguide filters","Wideband;Inverters;Band pass filters;Electromagnetic waveguides;Iris;Impedance;Design optimization;Network synthesis;Space technology;Frequency dependence","multiplexing equipment;optimisation;waveguide filters;band-pass filters;circuit CAD;circuit optimisation;impedance convertors;equiripple filters","dimensional synthesis;wide band waveguide filters;broadband waveguide filter;telecommunications;bandpass filters;waveguide cavity;iris network models;electromagnetic simulators;global optimization;impedance inverters;waveguide noncontiguous bandpass diplexers;optimization","","35","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We introduce a task duplication-based scheduling algorithm for network of heterogeneous systems (TANH), with complexity O(V/sup 2/), which provides optimal results for applications represented by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), provided a simple set of conditions on task computation and network communication time could be satisfied. The performance of the algorithm is illustrated by comparing the scheduling time with an existing ""best imaginary level scheduling (BIL)"" scheme for heterogeneous systems. The scalability for a higher or lower number of processors, as per their availability is also discussed.

The gain, cross-polarization, bandwidth and radiation patterns are discussed for different combinations of patch and ground plane. The radiation patterns are not significantly affected by meshing the patch alone, but meshing the ground plane increases the back radiation. The gain can suffer by up to 3 dB or more when compared to a standard patch. Cross-polarization is improved providing that the correct mesh line geometry is chosen for the excitation mode. Meshing lowered the resonant frequency in some cases by up to 30% and also improves the bandwidth by a factor of up to 2.5 in some modes.

This is achieved by means of driving both buck-boost DC-DC converters with two 180/spl deg/ phase-shifted DC-biased sinusoidal references. The differential output voltage is therefore an AC output voltage whose peak value is independent of the DC input voltage. The advantageous configuration of the buck-boost DC-AC inverter (AC voltage generated in a single stage, reduced number of semiconductors, small losses, output voltage naturally filtered, no dependence on the input voltage level, etc.) has a drawback related to the control of both buck-boost, as they are required to work in a variable operating point condition. This paper proposes a new double-loop control strategy for both buck-boost DC-DC converters that includes different compensations and feed-forward loops that make possible a fast and accurate control of both converters in a variable operating point condition. In addition, the proposed strategy achieves a high immunity to external perturbations such as input voltage and output load disturbances.

The proposed lines were realized through the integration of defected ground structures (DGSs) with conventional microstrip lines. A spiral-shaped DGS-integrated microstrip line enhances the port isolation of the antenna, while feeding the 2.0-GHz excitation to the antenna and filtering out the 2.5-GHz receiving signal from the other port. High-order harmonic signal suppression of the power amplifier at the 2.5-GHz port was accomplished by the dumbbell-shaped DGS, thereby improving the efficiency of the amplifier. Measurements show an improvement of 20 dB in port isolation and 3% in power-added efficiency relative to an identical RF front-end, but integrated with a conventional patch antenna. An image impedance of the DGS-integrated microstrip lines can be controlled by the integrated DGS geometries.

In this paper, we introduce a new notion, which we call six sigma supply chains to describe and quantify supply chains with sharp and timely deliveries, and develop an innovative approach for designing such networks. The approach developed in this paper is founded on an intriguing connection between mechanical design tolerancing and supply-chain lead-time compression. We show that the design of six sigma supply chains can be formulated as a mathematical programming problem, opening up a rich new framework for studying supply-chain design optimization problems. To show the efficacy of the notion and the design methodology, we focus on a design optimization problem, which we call the inventory optimization (IOPT) problem. Given a multistage supply-chain network, the IOPT problem seeks to find optimal allocation of lead time variabilities and inventories to individual stages, so as to achieve required levels of delivery performance in a cost-effective way. We formulate and solve the IOPT problem for a four-stage make-to-order liquid petroleum gas supply chain. The solution of the problem offers rich insights into inventory-service level tradeoffs in supply-chain networks and proves the potential of the new approach presented in this paper.<br><br>Note to Practitioners-This paper builds a bridge between mechanical design tolerancing and supply-chain management. In particular, the paper explores the use of statistical tolerancing techniques in achieving outstanding delivery performance through variability reduction. Informally, a six sigma supply chain is that which delivers products within a customer specified delivery window, with at most 3.4 missed deliveries per million. The innovations in this paper are the following: 1) to define two performance metrics delivery probability and delivery sharpness to describe the precision and accuracy of deliveries, in terms of process capability indexes C/sub p/,C/sub pk/, and C/sub pm/; 2) to formulate the supply-chain design optimization problem using the process capability indices; 3) to suggest an efficient solution procedure for the design optimization problem. The paper presents the case study of a two-echelon distribution network and using the framework developed in the paper shows the role of inventory in controlling lead time variability and achieving six sigma levels of delivery performance.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2004.829436","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1309666","","Six sigma;Supply chains;Design optimization;Mathematical programming;Design methodology;Petroleum;Bridges;Technological innovation;Measurement;Lead time reduction","six sigma (quality);supply chains;supply chain management;mathematical programming;inventory management","six sigma supply chains design;variability reduction;business process synchronization;supply chain networks;mechanical design tolerance;supply chain lead time compression;mathematical programming;inventory optimization;liquid petroleum gas supply chain;inventory-service level tradeoffs","","31","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The technique is named Scenario-Based Reliability Analysis (SBRA). Using scenarios of component interactions, we construct a probabilistic model named Component-Dependency Graph (CDG). Based on CDG, a reliability analysis algorithm is developed to analyze the reliability of the system as a function of reliabilities of its architectural constituents. An extension of the proposed model and algorithm is also developed for distributed software systems. The proposed approach has the following benefits: 1) It is used to analyze the impact of variations and uncertainties in the reliability of individual components, subsystems, and links between components on the overall reliability estimate of the software system. This is particularly useful when the system is built partially or fully from existing off-the-shelf components; 2) It is suitable for analyzing the reliability of distributed software systems because it incorporates link and delivery channel reliabilities; 3) The technique is used to identify critical components, interfaces, and subsystems; and to investigate the sensitivity of the application reliability to these elements; 4) The approach is applicable early in the development lifecycle, at the architecture level. Early detection of critical architecture elements, those that affect the overall reliability of the system the most, is useful in delegating resources in later development phases.","1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2004.838034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1360105","Component-based software;component-dependency graphs (CDG);scenario-based reliability analysis (SRBA);software reliability analysis and modeling","Application software;Software systems;NASA;Algorithm design and analysis;Computer architecture;DICOM;Software safety;Unified modeling language;Software quality;Software algorithms","object-oriented programming;software reliability;reliability theory;software reusability","scenario-based reliability analysis;component-based software;reliability model;probabilistic model;component-dependency graph;CDG;architectural constituent;subsystem reliability;software reuse;software system reliability estimation;delivery channel reliabilities;critical architecture element;distributed software system","","121","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This architecture provides practical migration steps from current-generation time-division multiplexing (TDM)-passive optical network (PONs) to future WDM optical access networks. The architecture is backward compatible for users on existing TDM-PONs, while simultaneously capable of providing upgraded high-bandwidth services to new users on DWDM-PONs through advanced WDM techniques. The SUCCESS architecture is based on a collector ring and several distribution stars connecting the CO and the users. A semipassive configuration of the Remote Nodes (RNs) enables protection and restoration, making the network resilient to power failures. A novel design of the OLT and DWDM-PON ONUs minimizes the system cost considerably: 1) tunable lasers and receivers at the OLT are shared by all ONUs on the network to reduce the transceiver count and 2) the fast tunable lasers not only generate downstream data traffic but also provide DWDM-PON ONUs with optical CW bursts for their upstream data transmission. Results from an experimental system testbed support the feasibility of the proposed SUCCESS architecture. Also, simulation results of the first SUCCESS DWDM-PON MAC protocol verify that it can efficiently provide bidirectional transmission between the OLT and ONUs over multiple wavelengths with a small number of tunable transmitters and receivers.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2004.836768","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1353388","Access networks;bidirectional transmission;media access control protocol;passive optical networks;time-division multiplexing (TDM);wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)","Next generation networking;Wavelength division multiplexing;Time division multiplexing;Optical fiber networks;Optical receivers;Optical transmitters;Passive optical networks;Tunable circuits and devices;WDM networks;Joining processes","optical fibre subscriber loops;wavelength division multiplexing;time division multiplexing;optical receivers;optical transmitters;access protocols","SUCCESS;hybrid WDM/TDM optical access network;Stanford University aCCESS;time division multiplexing-passive optical network;remote nodes;OLT;DWDM-PON ONU;tunable lasers;receivers;transceiver;optical CW bursts;MAC protocol","","166","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, bicycle is unstable in itself and it is fall down without human assistance like steering handle or moving upper body. In these days, electric power assistance bicycles are used practically, but all of those bicycles merely assist human with pedal driving and there are no bicycles that help to stabilize its position. Hence, stabilizing the posture and realizing stable driving of a bicycle have been researched. Dynamic model of running bicycle is complicated and it's hard to recognize completely. However, assuming that the rider doesn't move upper body, dynamics of bicycle is represented in equilibrium of gravity and centrifugal force. Centrifugal force is risen out from the running velocity and turning radius determined by steering angle. Under these conditions, it is possible to stabilize bicycle posture by controlling its steering. In this paper, the dynamic model derived from equilibrium of gravity and centrifugal force is proposed. Then the control method for bicycle steering based on acceleration control is proposed. Finally, the validity of this method is proved by the simulations and experimental results.","","0-7803-8300-1","10.1109/AMC.2004.1297665","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1297665","","Bicycles;Robot control;Vehicle dynamics;Turning;Humans;Gravity;Wheels;Control systems;Design engineering;Systems engineering and theory","mobile robots;vehicle dynamics;acceleration control;position control;electric drives;stability","self sustaining bicycle robot;bicycle steering controller;transportation device;electric power assistance bicycles;pedal driving;bicycle dynamics;centrifugal force;bicycle posture;acceleration control","","47","","4","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The servo specifications and design variables are specified and analyzed to formulate a controller optimization problem. The servo responses are then fed back to evaluate the overall system performances, which can be expressed as objective functions with respect to the servo control parameters. According to the objective functions and design specifications, the servo control parameters can be properly tuned toward their optimal values by using the proposed optimization techniques. In order to improve the convergent rate of the optimization process, a fuzzy-logic based step-size tuning strategy is presented. Because of the nonlinear property of the digital servo drives, the tuned servo control parameters may be only optimal for a particular operating point, therefore, once the optimum design is achieved, the proposed fuzzy optimizing controller can perform as an intelligent tuner for on-line gain adaptation under different loading conditions. The proposed fuzzy optimization servo tuner has been realized under a PC-MATLAB-based environment with an on-line controlled digital PMSM servo drive. Simulation and experimental results indicate that the control parameters of a digital PMSM servo drive can be optimized for its dynamic responses under various load conditions.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2004.830036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1310397","","Design optimization;Servomechanisms;Servosystems;Fuzzy control;Tuners;Permanent magnet motors;Magnetic analysis;Magnetic variables control;Performance evaluation;Optimal control","optimisation;permanent magnet motors;synchronous motor drives;tuning;fuzzy control;servomotors;electric machine analysis computing;machine control;control engineering computing","fuzzy optimization technique;digital PMSM servo drive;gradient optimization;fuzzy step-sizing technique;servo control parameter;fuzzy logic;step-size tuning;digital servo drives;online gain adaptation;PC-MATLAB","","42","","41","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Fuzzy dynamic programming is used to satisfy customers' requirements and yields a near optimal pre-scheduling of the DLC. Then, the energy payback associated with the DLC is further eliminated by the adaptive control strategy, which exploits interruptible loads to modify the DLC schedule in real-time. Through the developed adaptive control strategy, the influences of the load uncertainties and forecasting errors on the pre-scheduling of the DLC can also be excluded. The proposed algorithm was practically tested on the Taiwan power (Taipower) 38-unit system with 20 air-conditioner loads and 15 interruptible loads.

Analysis is performed on two types of manoeuvers, linear acceleration and steady turn. These manoeuvers could be used for in-flight INS alignment using GPS. During the constant linear acceleration without rotation relative to the Earth, the linear system model is shown to be time-invariant. The observability analysis for the time invariant linear system model shows that linear acceleration does not change the number of observable modes but rather the structure of the observable space. For a nonconstant linear acceleration or a steady turn, the perturbation linear system becomes time varying. For this time-varying system, three types of observability are considered, complete, differential, and instantaneous observability. Instantaneous observability is the strongest properties and means that the state of the system at any time may be determined instantaneously from observation of the output and its derivatives. Instantaneous observability is important for fast in-flight INS alignment. It is shown that the number of instantaneously observable moded is increased by at least 2 during a maneuver. Hence, some linear combinations of the attitude angles become instantaneously observable.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2004.1310002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1310002","","Observability;Global Positioning System;Estimation error;Acceleration;Earth;Linear systems;Vehicles;Gravity;Educational technology;Time varying systems","Global Positioning System;inertial navigation;inertial systems;acceleration;observability","integrated GPS/INS;observability analysis;perturbation model;Earth-centered-Earth-fixed;ECEF coordinate system;steady turn model;constant linear acceleration;linear system model;time-invariant model;observable space structure;nonconstant linear acceleration model;perturbation linear system;complete observability;differential observability;instantaneous observability","","84","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This type of switch combined the off-state shunt transistors and series microstrip lines to form an artificial transmission line with 50-/spl Omega/ characteristic impedance. A 15-80-GHz single-pole double-throw (SPDT) switch in conjunction with quarter-wavelength impedance transformers demonstrates an insertion loss of less than 3.6 dB and an isolation of better than 25 dB. Another type of wide-band switch was designed by using a series HEMT switch to replace the quarter-wavelength transformer, and the operating band can be extended to dc. With this scheme, dc-80-GHz single-pole single-throw (SPST) and dc-60-GHz SPDT switches are also developed with compact chip size. From dc to 80 GHz, the insertion loss and isolation of the SPST switch are better than 3 and 24 dB, respectively. The SPDT switch has an insertion loss of better than 3 dB and an isolation of better than 25 dB from dc to 60 GHz. The analysis of circuit characteristics and design procedures are also included. It is concluded that the device periphery can be selected for the desired bandwidth, while the number of transistors is decided to achieve the isolation.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2004.831574","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1318767","","MMICs;HEMTs;Switches;Insertion loss;Millimeter wave transistors;Wideband;Impedance;Transformers;Gallium arsenide;MODFETs","gallium arsenide;III-V semiconductors;field effect MIMIC;microwave switches;integrated circuit design;HEMT integrated circuits;passive networks;field effect transistor switches","millimeter-wave MMIC passive HEMT switches;millimeter-wave wide-band monolithic GaAs passive high electron-mobility transistor switches;quarter-wavelength transformer;traveling-wave;off-state shunt transistors;series microstrip lines;artificial transmission line;electrical impedance;single-pole double-throw switch;SPDT switch;circuit analysis;insertion loss;50 ohm;15 to 80 GHz;GaAs","","62","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed technique combines a rotor resistance estimation method with a thermal equivalent circuit. Usually, rotor resistance estimation works quite well under rated load conditions. By contrast, if the motor is slightly loaded, rotor resistance estimation becomes inaccurate due to the small slip. Therefore, rotor temperature estimation under low-load conditions may be estimated by a thermal equivalent model. In order to determine the rotor resistance and, thus, rotor temperature accurately, several machine parameters have to be obtained in advance. Load tests provide the leakage reactance and the iron losses of the induct machine. The stator resistance has to be measured separately. The parameters of the thermal equivalent model are a thermal resistance and a thermal capacitance. These parameters are derived from a heating test, where the reference temperature is provided from the parameter model in the time domain. This lumped thermal parameter model is based on the assumption that the total rotor temperature increase is caused by the total sum of the losses in the induction machine. Measuring results of a 1.5-kW and an 18.5-kW four-pole low-voltage motor and a 210-kW four-pole high-voltage motor are presented and compared.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2004.830759","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1315797","","Rotors;Temperature;Induction motors;Parameter estimation;Thermal resistance;Testing;Equivalent circuits;Iron;Stators;Electrical resistance measurement","rotors;squirrel cage motors;parameter estimation;stators;equivalent circuits;losses;resistors;capacitors","rotor;temperature estimation;squirrel-cage induction motor;parameter estimation;thermal equivalent circuit;resistance estimation;leakage reactance;iron losses;thermal capacitance;1.5 kW;18.5 kW;210 kW","","72","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Four representative-based algorithms for supervised clustering are introduced: a greedy algorithm with random restart, named SRIDHCR, that seeks for solutions by inserting and removing single objects from the current solution, SPAM (a variation of the clustering algorithm PAM), an evolutionary computing algorithm named SCEC, and a fast medoid-based top-down splitting algorithm, named TDS. The four algorithms were evaluated using a benchmark consisting of four UCI machine learning data sets.

CPM does not require per-flow state information and only introduces a few variables to record the protocol behaviors. The statelessness and low computation overhead of CPM make itself immune to any flooding attacks.

Photo voltaic and wind energy sources are being increasingly recognized as cost effective generation sources in small isolated power systems. A realistic cost benefit analysis requires evaluation models that can recognize the highly erratic nature of these energy sources while maintaining the chronology and inter dependence of the random variables inherent in them. This paper reports the probabilistic performance assessment of a wind, solar photo voltaic (SPV) hybrid energy system. A 400 watt wind electric generator (WEG), 840 WP (peak watt power) solar photo voltaic power generator, 6/spl times/75 Amp-Hour (Ah) backup storage batteries, charge controller (CC), 1 KVA inverter (INV), etc were designed, integrated and optimized to predict the behavior of generating system based on available local wind / solar and load data at Vasavi College of Engineering, Hyderabad, India. Storage batteries can be designed for various hours of uninterrupted power supply in the event of wind & SPV energy failures. This model is useful for evaluating the probabilistic reliability evaluation of generating systems and gaining a better insight in the component sizes needed before they are built. The loss of supply and effects of the randomness of the wind and solar radiation's were presented. The wind solar photo voltaic hybrid energy system (WSPVHES) is working satisfactorily.

A comparison is made between a conventional planar punchthrough IGBT (P-IGBT) using global lifetime control, a trench punchthrough IGBT (T-IGBT) using local lifetime control and a enhanced planar punchthrough IGBT (N-IGBT) also using the local lifetime control process. A simple and effective specific test circuit allows hard- and soft-switching operating modes, and provides also an independent control on the test parameters (load current, clamping voltage, gate resistance, temperature, dead times). It is highlighted that the local lifetime control is very efficient at high temperature reducing especially the turn-off losses. Furthermore, the T-IGBT exhibits very good performances during hard- and soft-switching turn-off, but this is not the case during hard-switching and zero-voltage switching turn-on. Due to its high input capacitance, the hard-switching turn-on losses are relatively high. Regarding the N-IGBT, it presents good performances under hard-switching and also zero-voltage switching. However, like the T-IGBT, its structure has a strong ""inductance behavior"" during zero-voltage turn-on increasing the conductivity modulation lag and also the voltage spike leading to high losses.

The proposed QP-based dynamical system approach is simulated based on the PUMA560 robot arm with efficiency and effectiveness demonstrated.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2004.830347","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1335507","","Constraint optimization;Manipulator dynamics;Quadratic programming;Acceleration;Linear matrix inequalities;Torque control;Robots;Kinematics;Neural networks;Piecewise linear techniques","quadratic programming;redundant manipulators;piecewise linear techniques;matrix inversion;constraint theory","joint torque optimization;physically constrained redundant manipulators;acceleration-level redundancy-resolution schemes;quadratic programming-based dynamical system approach;primal-dual dynamical system solver;linear variational inequalities;piecewise-linear dynamics;real-time matrix inversion;joint-acceleration information;manipulator torque control;velocity-level redundancy-resolution schemes;PUMA560 robot arm","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Feedback;Motion;Nonlinear Dynamics;Programming, Linear;Robotics;Torque","190","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A new JEDEC standard for board level drop test of handheld electronic products was just released to specify the drop test procedure and conditions. However, there is no detailed information stated on dynamic responses of printed circuit board (PCB) and solder joints which are closely related to stress and strain of solder joints that affect the solder joint reliability, nor there is any simulation technique which provides good correlation with experimental measurements of dynamic responses of PCB and the resulting solder joint reliability during the entire drop impact process. In this paper, comprehensive dynamic responses of PCB and solder joints, e.g., acceleration, strains, and resistance, are measured and analyzed with a multichannel real-time electrical monitoring system, and simulated with a novel input acceleration (Input-G) method. The solder joint failure process, i.e. crack initiation, propagation, and opening, is well understood from the behavior of dynamic resistance. It is found experimentally and numerically that the mechanical shock causes multiple PCB bending or vibration which induces the solder joint fatigue failure. It is proven that the peeling stress of the critical solder joint is the dominant failure indicator by simulation, which correlates well with the observations and assumptions by experiment. Coincidence of cyclic change among dynamic resistance of solder joints dynamic strains of PCB, and the peeling stress of the critical solder joints indicates that the solder joint crack opens and closes when PCB bends down and up, and the critical solder joint failure is induced by cyclic peeling stress. The failure mode and location of critical solder balls predicted by modeling correlate well with experimental observation by cross-section and dye penetration test.","","0-7803-8365-6","10.1109/ECTC.2004.1319475","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1319475","","Analytical models;Soldering;Stress;Electronic equipment testing;Circuit testing;Strain measurement;Electrical resistance measurement;Accelerometers;Acceleration;Electric resistance","soldering;printed circuit testing;circuit reliability;impact testing;fatigue testing;fatigue cracks;dynamic response;ball grid arrays;finite element analysis;production testing","dynamic response;drop impact;board level solder joint reliability;drop test;JEDEC standard;handheld electronic products;PCB joints;multichannel real-time electrical monitoring;input acceleration method;solder joint failure;crack initiation;crack propagation;crack opening;dynamic resistance;mechanical shock;PCB bending;PCB vibration;fatigue failure;peeling stress;critical solder joint;cyclic change;advanced simulation techniques;thin-profile fine-pitch BGA;finite element model;integrated testing and simulation","","55","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Also there is no investigation on whether the geometric correction derived for the ground plane can be applied to human objects standing upright to the plane. This paper derives the relation for geometric correction for the ground plane and proves formally that it can be directly applied to all the foreground pixels.

An UltraWideBand (UWB) system is particularly suitable for such local systems, including temporary installations supporting emergency services inside large buildings. The requirements for emergencies will be very variable, but will generally include: good radio penetration through structures, the rapid set-up of a stand-alone system, tolerance of high levels of reflection, and high accuracy. The accuracy should be better than 1 m, as sometimes it matters which side of a door you are, and locations should be in 3 dimensions. Support for robots as well as people would call for still better accuracy. Rapid set-up implies very little surveying of the fixed terminals, and positioning relative to the mobile and fixed terminals. A radio system that measures ranges between fixed and mobile terminals matches these requirements, but the requirements for accuracy and for dealing with multipath need a bandwidth of more than 1 GHz. Thus UWB is the preferred solution, as it has the specific advantage of high accuracy, even in the presence of severe multipath. This paper presents the features and system design options for UWB positioning systems, and shows how they match the indoor location demands of emergency services. The main features that are covered are: the deployment of terminals (how many, and where), the minimum requirements for fixed terminal surveying, integration (hybridisation) with GNSS, and solving for position inside the network. The main system design options are: whether the mobile terminals are transceivers or solely receivers, the UWB signal design and frequency span, and the use of the same signal for communications. The paper includes results from a demonstration UWB indoor positioning system being built at TRT (UK).","","0-7803-8416-4","10.1109/PLANS.2004.1309063","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1309063","","Ultra wideband technology;Satellite navigation systems;Emergency services;Satellite broadcasting;Radio navigation;Buildings;Reflection;Robots;Bandwidth;Transceivers","Global Positioning System;emergency services;radionavigation;position measurement","UltraWideBand indoor positioning systems;emergencies;reliable positioning;satellite navigation;good radio penetration;rapid set-up;stand-alone system;emergency services;accurate positioning;terminals deployment","","68","","3","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because of this, the dynamic properties of the uniformly-sampled pulse-width modulators used in low power applications become an important restriction for the maximum achievable bandwidth of control loops. After the discussion of the most commonly used uniformly-sampled pulse-width modulators, small-signal frequency- and Laplace-domain models for the different types of uniformly-sampled pulse-width modulators are derived theoretically.

Some published simulation results ignore this initialization discrepancy. For those results that attempt to account for this discrepancy, the practice is to discard an initial sequence of observations from a simulation in the hope that the remaining values will closely represent the stationary distribution. This approach is inefficient and not always reliable. However, if the initial locations and speeds of the nodes are chosen from the stationary distribution, convergence is immediate and no data need be discarded. We derive the stationary distributions for location, speed, and pause time for the random waypoint mobility model. We then show how to implement the random waypoint mobility model in order to construct more efficient and reliable simulations for mobile ad hoc networks. Simulation results, which verify the correctness of our method, are included.

It is then shown that a stator-flux-oriented control scheme can achieve synchronous operation of the machine without a position sensor at medium and high electrical frequencies. For a given speed and torque, power losses in the machine are shown to be a function of only the stator flux magnitude. As the power losses are a convex function of the stator flux level, the optimal flux value can be found using a one-dimensional optimization algorithm, such as the Method of Sequential Quadratic Interpolations. Optimal flux values for a synchronous reluctance machine are determined using an experimental setup that accurately determines losses in the motor/drive system.

Time domain simulation plus fast Fourier transform (FFT) is a viable method. However, the simulation circuit has to be carefully modeled, and must cover high frequency characteristics up to 30 MHz. For this purpose, multiple modeling and characterization techniques in the medium and high frequencies are developed, which finally lead to a good simulation circuit in Saber for a 1 KW continuous-conduction-mode (CCM) PFC converter. The conducted EMI of the PFC converter has been successfully predicted up to 30 MHz in terms of both differential-mode (DM) and common-mode (CM) noise, which substantiates the afore-mentioned modeling and characterization techniques. To explain the conducted EMI behavior of the CCM PFC in a systematic way, the DM and CM loop models of PFC EMI are proposed for describing the noise generation and propagation mechanisms.

This dc-dc converter is connected in series with a pole of the HVDC transmission line. It drains energy to a dc capacitor through an air-core transformer and a single-phase diode rectifier connected at the secondary. A pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) voltage-source converter is directly connected to this dc capacitor to supply ac loads. The HVDC tap comprises all those components and can supply high-quality power to isolated or interconnected load areas. The controller of the HVDC tap is independent from the control systems of the main HVDC converter stations. It does not need any communication channel to the control of the main HVDC converter stations. A complete bipolar /spl plusmn/500-kV HVDC system, together with a refined model of dc transmission line were implemented to simulate the performance of the proposed HVDC tap.

It has been reported that the linear techniques used to control such noise exhibit degradation in performance. In addition, the actuators of an active noise control (ANC) system very often have nonminimum-phase response. A linear controller under such situations can not model the inverse of the actuator, and hence yields poor performance. A novel filtered-s least mean square (FSLMS) algorithm based ANC structure, which functions as a nonlinear controller, is proposed in this paper. A fast implementation scheme of the FSLMS algorithm is also presented. Computer simulations have been carried out to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the standard filtered-x least mean square (FXLMS) algorithm and even performs better than the recently proposed Volterra filtered-x least mean square (VFXLMS) algorithm, in terms of mean square error (MSE), for active control of nonlinear noise processes. An evaluation of the computational requirements shows that the FSLMS algorithm offers a computational advantage over VFXLMS when the secondary path estimate is of length less than 6. However, the fast implementation of the FSLMS algorithm substantially reduces the number of operations compared to that of FSLMS as well as VFXLMS algorithm.","1558-2353","","10.1109/TSA.2003.822741","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1288157","","Active noise reduction;Least squares approximation;Acoustic noise;Stochastic systems;Stochastic resonance;Degradation;Control systems;Inverse problems;Hydraulic actuators;Computer simulation","filtering theory;least mean squares methods;acoustic noise;computational complexity;acoustic signal processing;nonlinear control systems;active noise control;adaptive control;feedforward neural nets","active mitigation;nonlinear noise processes;filtered-s LMS algorithm;least mean square;acoustic noise;dynamical systems;linear techniques;active noise control system;actuators;nonminimum phase secondary path estimate;linear controller;filtered-x LMS algorithm;mean square error;chaotic noise;functional link artificial neural network;computational complexity;feedforward artificial neural network","","151","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These perturbation segments can excite two degenerate orthogonal modes with equal amplitude, and, to obtain phase quadrature, the operating frequency of the circularly polarized antennas is located between the resonant frequencies of the two modes. Notches or embedded slots are often used as the perturbation segments for rectangular, circular, and triangular microstrip antennas, and a 50 /spl Omega/ input impedance can be easily found inside the patch. For an annular-ring microstrip antenna that is smaller than square or circular microstrip antennas for a given frequency, a pair of notches have been also applied to achieve the CP design (Chen, H.M. and Wong, K.L., IEEE Trans. Antennas Propagat., vol.AP-47, p.1289-92, 1999). However, an additional impedance transformer is necessary to overcome the high impedance problem of the annular-ring microstrip antenna operated at fundamental TM/sub 11/ mode (Kokotoff, D.M. et al., IEEE Trans.

This paper proposes a new strategy to improve the power transfer capability constrained by small-signal stability by appropriately rescheduling generation based on sensitivity analysis. In the proposed strategy, a small-signal stability index, which can be computed quickly and reliably, is used to determine the small-signal security status of a system and also for the purpose of contingency screening. Two sensitivity-based dispatch methods are proposed to reschedule the generation in order to maximize power transfer subject to the small-signal stability constraint under a set of selected contingencies.

Due to technological improvements, switching frequencies have been increased leading to reduced passive component values but also greater EMI levels, especially conducted common mode disturbances. This paper presents a simple and effective EMI forecast method to study and to analyze the conducted EMI effects before prototype testing. The methodology is validated and applied to the single phase full bridge power factor correction (PFC) rectifier. Several techniques to reduce common mode current (CMC) levels created by the converter are presented. The study is based on high frequency models and understanding of phenomenon. Looking at the control strategies and/or the propagation paths, it is demonstrated that EMI levels may be reduced. It is shown that with symmetrical EMI propagation paths, synchronized control strategies such as bipolar pulse width modulation (PWM) are preferred and lead to reduced CMC levels. On the other hand, with asymmetrical propagation paths, unipolar and half bridge control strategies may be preferred to reduce both differential mode current (DMC) and CMC levels. Results are validated using practical experiments performed under EMI regulation testing conditions.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2003.823190","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1271321","","Bridges;Rectifiers;Electromagnetic interference;Pulse width modulation;Switched-mode power supply;Testing;Switching frequency;Prototypes;Power factor correction;Frequency synchronization","electromagnetic interference;power factor correction;rectifying circuits;PWM power convertors;interference suppression;rectifiers","power factor correction;full bridge rectifiers;electromagnetic interference;EMI modeling;common mode disturbance reduction;common mode current;EMI propagation;bipolar pulse width modulation;differential mode current","","31","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The off-state drain current of the OP-TFT is significantly increased due to the illumination, while a smaller relative effect is observed on the drain current in the strong-accumulation regime. The illumination effectively decreases the threshold voltage of the device and increases the apparent subthreshold swing, while the field-effect mobility of the charge carriers in the polymer channel is unchanged. We have observed full recovery of our devices after the illumination is removed at room temperature. These observations are explained in terms of the photogeneration of excitons due to the absorbed photons. The photogenerated excitons subsequently diffuse and dissociate into free charge carriers, thereby enhancing the carrier density in the channel of the device. We have found broadband responsivities of approximately 0.7 mA/W for devices biased in the strong-accumulation regime and gate-to-source voltage-independent photosensitivities of approximately 10/sup 3/ for devices in the off-state.

To do this, we conducted a time-domain analysis of robustness of the foregoing controller with respect to parametric and unmodeled dynamics uncertainty. The controller, which is designed by a dominant second-order pole technique, turns out to be fragile (as opposed to robust) with respect to unmodeled dynamics uncertainty.

Apart from not requiring sophisticated computation of the panel power, this SFMS does not approximate the panel characteristics and can globally locate the MPP under wide insolation conditions.

These motors were chosen due to their vacuum compatibility and inherent self braking. The joint consists of a single USM driving a harmonic drive and an electronics board used for motor control, joint telemetry gathering and serial communications to the control computer. Multiple joints are connected in parallel to the motor drive bus and sequentially switched to create near coordinated motion. In order to realize this control architecture, a digital USM controller was developed to replace the analog drive electronics.

We base our research on the premise that the next revolution of technology in the home will arise from devices that help older adults maintain their independence. A coherent suite of technologies will eventually let older adults be proactive about their own healthcare, will aid them in daily activities and help them learn new skills, will create new avenues for social communication, and will help ensure their safety and well being.

The transferable electric power and the efficiency of magnetic assemblies with large air gaps can be considerably improved by using higher transmission frequencies in the range of several hundred kilohertz. Contactless energy transmission systems operate at resonance. With a proper choice of the resonance capacitors on the primary and secondary side, the contactless system represents an ohmic load for the primary inverter. Therefore switching events take place at zero current (ZCS) without auxiliary commutation elements, which is an important precondition for reaching higher transmission frequencies. For this application a special inverter was developed. The phase-shifted controlled bridge at the primary side is equipped with IGBT and freewheeling SiC Schottky diodes. Because of their ultra low reverse recovery charge, the operation behaviour is much better compared to fast Si diodes. The different switching events of the inverter with freewheeling SiC Schottky diodes are investigated in detail. An experimental arrangement transfers an electric power of 1 kW through an air gap of 300 mm.

In this paper we present new algorithmic techniques that substantially improve the running time of the belief propagation approach. One of our techniques reduces the complexity of the inference algorithm to be linear rather than quadratic in the number of possible labels for each pixel, which is important for problems such as optical flow or image restoration that have a large label set. A second technique makes it possible to obtain good results with a small fixed number of message passing iterations, independent of the size of the input images. Taken together these techniques speed up the standard algorithm by several orders of magnitude.

For dipole lengths around quarter-wave the current peaks and dips are modest. This trend continues to shorter dipoles; for lengths of 0.1 wavelength or less, the current is nearly constant along the array.

The proposed adaptive fuzzy sliding-mode control system is comprised of a fuzzy controller and a compensation controller. The fuzzy controller is the main tracking controller, which is used to approximate an ideal computational controller. The compensation controller is designed to compensate for the difference between the ideal computational controller and the fuzzy controller. A tuning methodology is derived to tune the premise and consequence parts of the fuzzy rules. The online tuning algorithm is derived in the Lyapunov sense; thus, the stability of the control system can be guaranteed. Moreover, to relax the requirement for the uncertain bound in the compensation controller, an estimation mechanism is investigated to observe the uncertain bound, so that the chattering phenomena of the control efforts can be relaxed. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method, a comparison between a conventional fuzzy control and the proposed adaptive fuzzy sliding-mode control is made. Simulation and experimental results verify that the proposed adaptive fuzzy sliding-mode control design method can achieve favorable control performance with regard to parameter variations and external disturbances.","1558-0059","","10.1109/TEC.2003.821859","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1300702","","Programmable control;Adaptive control;Fuzzy control;Fuzzy systems;Sliding mode control;Servomotors;Control systems;Design methodology;Adaptive systems;Stability","variable structure systems;adaptive control;servomotors;compensation;fuzzy control;Lyapunov methods;stability;induction motors;machine control","adaptive control;sliding-mode control;induction servomotor systems;compensation controller;computational controller;online tuning algorithm;Lyapunov sense;estimation mechanism;fuzzy control","","72","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we discuss the shadowing effect on the system utilizing plural LED lightings including the performance of ISI based on the delay profile. We consider the downlink transmission based on TDMA and evaluate the shadowing effect caused by pedestrians with computer simulation. As a result, when the shadowing often occurs at 800 Mb/s, the performance of outage call duration rate and blocking rate are improved by the 3 LED lightings resulting in an optical number of the LED lighting.

However, the maximum symbol transmission rate of an STBC from complex orthogonal designs for complex signals is only 3/4 for three and four transmit antennas, and it is difficult to construct complex orthogonal designs with rate higher than 1/2 for more than four transmit antennas. Recently, Jafarkhani, Tirkkonen-Boariu-Hottinen, and Papadias-Foschini proposed STBCs from quasi-orthogonal designs, where the orthogonality is relaxed to provide higher symbol transmission rates. With the quasi-orthogonal structure, the quasi-orthogonal STBCs still have a fast ML decoding, but do not have the full diversity. The performance of these codes is better than that of the codes from orthogonal designs at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), but worse at high SNR. This is due to the fact that the slope of the performance curve depends on the diversity. It is desired to have the quasi-orthogonal STBCs with full diversity to ensure good performance at high SNR. In this paper, we achieve this goal by properly choosing the signal constellations. Specifically, we propose that half of the symbols in a quasi-orthogonal design are chosen from a signal constellation set A and the other half of them are chosen from a rotated constellation e/sup j/spl phi// A. The resulting STBCs can guarantee both full diversity and fast ML decoding. Moreover, we obtain the optimum selections of the rotation angles /spl phi/ for some commonly used signal constellations. Simulation results show that the proposed codes outperform the codes from orthogonal designs at both low and high SNRs.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2004.834740","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337107","","Constellation diagram;Block codes;Maximum likelihood decoding;Signal design;Transmitting antennas;Receiving antennas;Signal to noise ratio;Wireless communication;Gallium nitride;Modulation coding","space-time codes;block codes;maximum likelihood decoding;transmitting antennas;antenna arrays;diversity reception;quadrature phase shift keying;optimisation","space-time block code;STBC;maximum-likelihood decoding;maximum symbol transmission rate;transmit antenna;quasiorthogonal design;signal constellation;rotated constellation;rotation angle;multiple antenna;wireless communication","","364","","44","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, realistic virtual faces with different PIE are synthesized based on the personalized 3D face to characterize the face subspace. Finally, face recognition is conducted based on these representative virtual faces. Compared with other related works, this framework has the following advantages: 1) only one single frontal face is required for face recognition, which avoids the burdensome enrollment work; 2) the synthesized face samples provide the capability to conduct recognition under difficult conditions like complex PIE; and 3) the proposed 2D-to-3D integrated face reconstruction approach is fully automatic and more efficient.

Since the voltage stress applied to the power devices of three-level configuration is half that of the two-level version, this topology was traditionally used for medium voltage drives both in industrial and traction areas. Basic behavior of the NPC topology brings significant advantages to the low voltage applications as well. Especially, the lower voltage steps associated with the switching help in the mitigation of problems related to surge voltages at the motor terminals, leakage current, shaft voltage and bearing current, and so on. The three-level NPC inverter newly introduced for general-purpose application combines sophisticated PWM technique and modern control laws to yield high performance drive.

A ""design-for-layout"" approach has allowed this to be done in an area of just 0.44 mm/sup 2/. The increased switching noise associated with a high degree of segmentation has been reduced by a new latch architecture. Differential nonlinearity of /spl plusmn/0.3 LSB and integral nonlinearity of /spl plusmn/0.4 LSB have been measured. Low-frequency SFDR of 95 dB has been achieved, while SFDR at 320 MS/s remains above 70 and 60 dB for input frequencies up to 10 and 60 MHz, respectively. The converter consumes a total of 82 mW from 1.8-V and 3.3-V supplies.

Carbon black was selected as the filler due to its large surface area and its wide range of electrical properties based on its surface chemistry, particle size and aggregate structure. Six different types of carbon blacks were evaluated. With a proper filler loading level and good dispersion, high dielectric constants over 1000 were observed for four out of the six types of carbon. The dispersion of carbon black is critical to obtain high dielectric constant carbon black composites. When the carbon black is well dispersed, the large surface area of tiny carbon black aggregates serve as the electrode surfaces of numerous small capacitors. The capacitor network within the composite can thus give a large capacitance and dielectric constant. For a highly conductive carbon black CBD3, a high dielectric constant over 13,300 (@10 kHz) was achieved, and for a relatively low conductivity carbon black CBC2, a dielectric constant of about 2,300 (@10 kHz) was obtained. A higher conductivity carbon black usually gives a higher dielectric constant; however, its composites are more difficult to process since the composites have a narrower composition window near the percolation threshold due to its high structure and large surface area. The filler loading level required to reach high dielectric constant is much lower than that of ceramic composites, which enable carbon black composites to have good mechanical properties. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize the structure of carbon and their composites, respectively, in order to correlate the structure of carbon blacks and the morphology of their composites with the corresponding material dielectric properties.","","0-7803-8365-6","10.1109/ECTC.2004.1319391","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1319391","","High-K gate dielectrics;Polymers;Capacitors;Surface morphology;Scanning electron microscopy;Composite materials;Dielectric materials;Organic materials;Aggregates;Dielectric constant","carbon;permittivity;particle reinforced composites;filled polymers;thin film capacitors;electrical conductivity;percolation;transmission electron microscopy;scanning electron microscopy;particle size;capacitance","super high dielectric constant carbon black-filled polymer composites;integral capacitor dielectrics;embedded capacitors;carbon black filler;surface area;electrical properties;surface chemistry;particle size;aggregate structure;filler loading level;filler dispersion;carbon black aggregates;small capacitor electrode surfaces;composite capacitor network;capacitance;carbon black conductivity;CBD3;CBC2;composite composition window;TEM;SEM;percolation threshold;transmission electron microscopy;scanning electron microscopy;10 kHz;C","","10","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To transmit their data to the base, all the sensors are required to be connected to a high-energy communication node, which serves as a relay from the ground to a satellite or to a high-altitude aircraft. The sensors are assumed to have a fixed communication and a fixed sensing range, which can significantly vary depending on the type of sensing performed. This simple framework serves to benchmark a multi objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) for the sensor placement, where the two competing objectives considered are the total sensor coverage and the lifetime of the network. The MOGA is then used to show that, for different relative sensing ranges, two fundamentally different types of layouts are obtained: one with the sensors closely packed together, the other with the sensors organized in a hub-and-spoke manner. The ratio of sensing to communication range is shown to be the discriminating factor.","1550-2252","0-7803-8255-2","10.1109/VETECS.2004.1391366","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1391366","","Wireless sensor networks;Genetic algorithms;Relays;Aircraft;Chemical sensors;Acoustic sensors;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Artificial satellites;Surveillance;Paper technology","wireless sensor networks;optimisation;telecommunication network planning;telecommunication network management;genetic algorithms","layout optimization;wireless sensor network;multi-objective genetic algorithm;sensor placement;total sensor coverage;network lifetime;MOGA;hub-and-spoke layout;closely packed layout","","94","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We avoid the complexity of directly processing 3-D mesh data by proposing the innovative idea of detecting features on two range images computed from the 3-D image. The dental arch is first obtained from the plan-view range image. Using the arch as the reference, a panoramic range image of the dental model can be computed. The interstices between the teeth are detected separately in the two range images, and results from both views are combined for a determination of interstice locations and orientations. Finally, the teeth are separated from the gums by delineating the gum margin. The algorithm was tested on 34 dental models representing a variety of malocclusions and was found to be robust and accurate.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2004.824235","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269881","","Teeth;Image segmentation;Dentistry;Application software;Computer aided manufacturing;Computer vision;Computational modeling;Design automation;Image restoration;Kelvin","dentistry;medical image processing;image segmentation;feature extraction;optical scanners","tooth segmentation;dental study model;orthodontic feature detection;laser scanner;range images;3-D image;dental arch;interstice locations;malocclusions","Algorithms;Dental Models;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Malocclusion;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photogrammetry;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Tooth","71","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method relies on SAR texture, extracted by ratioing the despeckled SAR image to its low-pass approximation. SAR texture is used to modulate the generalized intensity (GI) of the MS image, which is given by a linear transform extending intensity-hue-saturation transform to an arbitrary number of bands. Before modulation, the GI is enhanced by injection of high-pass details extracted from the available panchrmomatic image by means of the ""a/spl grave/-trous"" wavelet decomposition. The texture-modulated panchrmomatic-sharpened GI replaces the GI calculated from the resampled original MS data. Then, the inverse transform is applied to obtain the fusion product. Experimental results are presented on Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus and European Remote Sensing 2 satellite images of an urban area. The results demonstrate accurate spectral preservation on vegetated regions, bare soil, and also on textured areas (buildings and road network) where SAR texture information enhances the fusion product, which can be usefully applied for both visual analysis and classification purposes.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.838344","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1369379","Intensity–hue–saturation (IHS) transformation;Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+);multisensor data fusion;multispectral imagery;synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery;texture","Satellites;Remote sensing;Image fusion;Intensity modulation;Data mining;Synthetic aperture radar;Urban areas;Soil;Roads;Image texture analysis","remote sensing by radar;sensor fusion;synthetic aperture radar;terrain mapping;radar imaging;image texture;feature extraction","Landsat ETM+;SAR image fusion;generalized intensity modulation;multisensor image fusion algorithm;panchromatic sharpening;multispectral data;SAR imagery;SAR texture;despeckled SAR image;low-pass approximation;linear transform;intensity-hue-saturation transform;panchromatic image;a-trous wavelet decomposition;texture modulation;inverse transform;Landsat-7;Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus;European Remote Sensing 2 satellite;urban area;spectral preservation;vegetated regions;bare soil;textured areas;buildings;road network;texture information;fusion product;visual analysis;multispectral imagery;synthetic aperture radar","","90","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We present a new real-time methodology based on linear FE analysis that is appropriate for a wide range of surgical simulation applications. A methodology is proposed that is characterized by high model resolution, low preprocessing time, unrestricted multipoint surface contact, and adjustable boundary conditions. These features make the method ideal for modeling suturing, which is an element common to almost every surgical procedure. We describe constraints in the context of a Suturing Simulator currently being developed.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2004.1272730","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1272730","","Finite element methods;Surgery;Computational modeling;Geometry;Virtual environment;Deformable models;Haptic interfaces;Anatomy;Analytical models;Boundary conditions","finite element analysis;virtual reality;computational geometry;surgery;haptic interfaces;rendering (computer graphics);digital simulation","real-time finite element modeling;deformable geometries;virtual environments;haptic support;real-time deformation;surgical simulation applications;multipoint surface contact;adjustable boundary conditions;suturing simulator","Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Computer Systems;Finite Element Analysis;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Models, Biological;Surgery, Computer-Assisted;Suture Techniques;User-Computer Interface","98","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This metamaterial surface is constituted by a thin dielectric slab on both sides of which ""gangbuster"" dipoles are printed. Inserting the thin slab inside a parallel-plate one-dimensional (1D) cavity resonator has the effect of decreasing the resonant frequency. Placing the metamaterial slab at the center of a rectangular waveguide lowers the cut-off frequency of the dominant mode of the waveguide also. The corresponding dispersion curve exhibits a smooth transition from a fast-wave to a slow-wave regime and then asymptotically tends to the dispersion curve of the first TE surface-wave mode of the metamaterial slab. This suggests a natural way to conceive a 3D compact cavity resonator by placing two perfectly electrically conducting walls, a half of the wavelength of the slow-wave mode apart, inside the above rectangular waveguide. The analysis, performed by a circuit network theory and validated by a full-wave numerical analysis, provides simple formulas to predict the resonant frequency and the dispersion diagrams of these structures.","1548-5757","","10.1109/LAWP.2004.836576","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1351667","","Metamaterials;Cavity resonators;Slabs;Rectangular waveguides;Resonant frequency;Dielectrics;Cutoff frequency;Tellurium;Performance analysis;RLC circuits","metamaterials;cavity resonators;rectangular waveguides;waveguide theory;waveguide components;dielectric bodies;conducting bodies;dispersion (wave);surface electromagnetic waves;frequency selective surfaces","metamaterial surface;3D compact cavity resonators;metamaterial thin surface;thin dielectric slab;gangbuster dipoles;1D parallel-plate cavity resonator;resonant frequency;rectangular waveguide;dispersion curve;perfectly electrically conducting walls;PEC walls;circuit network theory;full-wave numerical analysis;dispersion diagrams;gangbuster-FSS","","54","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The large current carrying capacity and low thermal conductivity of the HTSs allows relatively short lengths to carry large currents to low-temperature devices without introducing heat to the device. Such current leads can dramatically reduce the refrigeration requirements for devices such as SMES. The HTSs make a relatively sharp transition to a highly resistive state when the critical current density is exceeded, and this effect has suggested their use for resistive fault current limiters. The bulk HTSs may also take the form of large single-grained superconductors within which circulating currents may flow at large current density without loss. They are capable of developing magnetizations, similar to that of permanent magnets, but with much larger magnetic fields. In this case, they may be used as field-trapping components. Applications in this case include brushless synchronous motors, laboratory magnets, magnetic separation, and magnetron sputtering. The bulk HTSs may also be used as diamagnetic objects in magnetic circuits to provide new types of power devices. One application that uses this effect is an inductive fault current limiters, in which the HTS shields an iron core in an inductive circuit until some current level is exceeded. This transition increases the component from low impedance to high impedance. The diamagnetic property may also be used to create low-loss magnetic bearings for use in efficient energy-storage flywheel devices or sensitive instrumentation. The combination of diamagnetic shielding and field trapping has suggested their use in motor designs analogous to hysteresis motors. Laboratory prototypes for all of these devices have been constructed and tested, and in some cases the devices have been field tested in actual power systems. Improvements in HTS properties, such as flux pinning, mechanical strength, and the ability to grow large grains, have greatly improved the economics of applications that use bulk HTS.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2004.833796","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1335558","","High temperature superconductors;Superconducting magnetic energy storage;Magnetic separation;Thermal conductivity;Fault current limiters;Magnetic flux;Synchronous motors;Laboratories;Impedance;Hysteresis motors","bismuth compounds;strontium compounds;calcium compounds;type II superconductors;yttrium compounds;barium compounds;high-temperature superconductors;magnetisation;magnetic levitation;sputtering;critical current density (superconductivity);sintering;ceramics;mechanical strength;surface cracks;flywheels;scanning tunnelling microscopy","bulk high-temperature superconductors;electrical power applications;current carrying capacity;thermal conductivity;low-temperature devices;refrigeration;sharp transition;highly resistive state;critical current density;resistive fault current limiters;SMES;large single-grained superconductors;magnetization;field-trapping components;brushless synchronous motors;laboratory magnets;magnetic separation;magnetron sputtering;diamagnetic objects;magnetic circuits;HTS shields;iron core;inductive circuit;low impedance-high impedance transition;low-loss magnetic bearings;efficient energy-storage flywheel devices;sensitive instrumentation;diamagnetic shielding;hysteresis motors;laboratory prototypes;flux pinning;mechanical strength;grain growth;permanent magnets;power devices;inductive fault current;diamagnetic properties;field trapping;YBa/sub 2/Cu/sub 3/O/sub 7/;Bi/sub 2/Sr/sub 2/Ca/sub 2/Cu/sub 3/O/sub 10/;Bi/sub 2/Sr/sub 2/Ca/sub 1/Cu/sub 3/O/sub 10/","","127","","55","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Among microphone array structures the recently proposed general transfer function generalized sidelobe canceller (TF-GSC) has shown impressive noise reduction abilities in a directional noise field, while still maintaining low speech distortion. However, in a diffused noise field less significant noise reduction is obtainable. The performance is even further degraded when the noise signal is nonstationary. In this contribution we propose three postfiltering methods for improving the performance of microphone arrays. Two of which are based on single-channel speech enhancers and making use of recently proposed algorithms concatenated to the beamformer output. The third is a multichannel speech enhancer which exploits noise-only components constructed within the TF-GSC structure. This work concentrates on the assessment of the proposed postfiltering structures. An extensive experimental study, which consists of both objective and subjective evaluation in various noise fields, demonstrates the advantage of the multichannel postfiltering compared to the single-channel techniques.","1558-2353","","10.1109/TSA.2004.834599","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1344023","","Speech enhancement;Transfer functions;Microphone arrays;Noise cancellation;Working environment noise;Noise reduction;Low-frequency noise;Degradation;Frequency;Concatenated codes","speech enhancement;transfer functions;microphones;filtering theory;interference suppression;distortion","single-channel speech enhancement;general transfer function;GSC;microphone array;generalized sidelobe canceller;noise reduction;postfiltering methods","","87","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A synchronous system must know the maximum time needed to compute a function, but a circuit usually finishes computation earlier than the worst-case delay.

As a first step in achieving variable pipeline delays based on data values, approximation circuits can increase clock frequency by reducing the number of cycles a function requires. Instead of implementing the complete logic function, a simplified circuit mimics it using rough calculations to predict results. The results are correct most of the time, and simulations show improvements in overall performance in spite of the overhead needed to recover from mistakes.","1558-0814","","10.1109/MC.2004.1274006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1274006","","Circuits;Delay;Frequency;Clocks;Pipelines;Microprocessors;Logic;Adders;Performance gain;Parallel processing","microprocessor chips;performance evaluation;circuit simulation;synchronisation;pipeline processing","processing speedup;approximation circuits;microprocessors;synchronization;variable pipeline delays;clock frequency;simulations;performance","","107","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Since passivity and asymptotic stability of the controller hold also for varying damping matrices, some possibilities of designing those gain matrices (depending on the actual inertia matrix) are addressed. The passivity of the controller relies on the usage of only motor side measurements for the position feedback.

The evaluation method addresses three important modulator characteristics: the output waveform quality, the input waveform quality and the switching losses associated with the modulation schemes. The method is used to evaluate four different modulation strategies, all based on the direct space-vector modulation approach. Further, regarding the switching losses, the paper proposes a new space-vector approach by which the switching losses can be reduced by 15%-35%, depending on the output load angle. This new modulation approach is applicable whenever the output voltage reference is below half the input voltage and the output voltage quality is then superior to that of the conventional space vector modulation scheme. The functionality of the new modulation scheme is validated by both simulations and experimental results and compared to waveforms obtained by using exiting space vector modulation schemes. The output voltage of the proposed scheme turns out to be comparable to the best of the conventional schemes while the input current is more distorted.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2003.821900","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265795","","Matrix converters;Voltage;Switching loss;Pulse width modulation converters;Space vector pulse width modulation;Pulse width modulation inverters;Topology;Pulse width modulation;Switching frequency;Motor drives","AC-AC power convertors;matrix convertors;PWM power convertors;induction motor drives;switching convertors","three-phase to three-phase matrix converters;modulation schemes evaluation;output waveform quality;input waveform quality;switching losses;direct space-vector modulation;harmonic distortion;PWM;bidirectional configuration;double-sided vector sequences;induction motor drive","","138","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, we have also developed a compact 6-degree-of-freedom haptic interface as a master device. The important features of our teleoperation system are its robustness against modeling errors and its ability to realize the force exerted by the operator at the remote site. We introduce a new control method, which modified our model-based teleoperation system, to control the real robotic system Engineering Test Satellite VII manipulator. Surface-tracking and peg-in-hole tasks have been performed to confirm the effectiveness of our system. The experimental results obtained with our system including the haptic interface demonstrate its ability to perform these tasks in space without any major problems. We also evaluated different master device approaches for the model-based space teleoperation system. For this purpose, we used two methods, which are a master-slave (MS) approach and a force-joystick approach.

Its characteristics have been investigated in detail using the FDTD method. The behavior mechanism for the high gain performances of the stacked microstrip antenna is explained clearly for the first time. The characteristics of the stacked antenna depend on the patch separation distance, that is, the thickness of the parasitic patch substrate. When the patch distance is approximately half a wavelength in the dielectric, an electric standing wave contributing to the radiation exists in the cavity between patches, and the amplitude of the electric fields becomes large. Because the thick dielectric is inserted in the space between the fed and the parasitic patches, the height of this stacked antenna becomes low. By adjusting the patch distance, the patch size and the feed point, the stacked microstrip antenna which has both wide bandwidth and high gain is successfully realized.","","0-7803-8302-8","10.1109/APS.2004.1329624","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1329624","","Microstrip antennas;Broadband antennas;Dielectric substrates;Finite difference methods;Bandwidth;Patch antennas;Stacking;Antennas and propagation;Performance gain;Resonance","finite difference time-domain analysis;antenna radiation patterns;microstrip antennas;antenna feeds","wideband antenna;wideband microstrip antenna;high-gain antenna;thick parasitic patch substrate;stacked microstrip antenna;FDTD method;patch separation distance;electric standing wave;radiation patterns","","16","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The modeling of traffic flow consisting of such vehicles is important for analyzing the effects of vehicle automation on the characteristics of traffic flow and for suggesting macroscopic control strategies to improve efficiency. Such analysis may also suggest ways for modifying the vehicle control characteristics in order to improve the macroscopic behavior of traffic. In this paper, we developed a mesoscopic and macroscopic model that describes the automated traffic-flow dynamics in a single highway lane. The mesoscopic model describes the speed and density continuously in time and space and at the same time retains the microscopic characteristics of traffic flow. The macroscopic model describes the average speed and density at each section of the lane and at each point in time. Even though the macroscopic model does not retain the microscopic characteristics of the vehicular traffic, computationally it is much simpler than the mesoscopic one. Simulations are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of these models in describing traffic-flow characteristics.

This has lead to the common practice of categorizing bearing faults according to fault location (i.e., inner race, outer race, ball, or cage fault). While the ability to detect the four characteristic fault frequencies is necessary, this approach neglects another important class of faults that arise in many industrial settings. This research introduces the notion of categorizing bearing faults as either single-point defects or generalized roughness. These classes separate bearing faults according to the fault signatures that are produced rather than by the physical location of the fault. Specifically, single-point defects produce the four predictable characteristic fault frequencies while faults categorized as generalized roughness produce unpredictable broadband changes in the machine vibration and stator current.

The selection of the impedance parameters is based on the behavior in contact and makes reference to a new design parameter, the compliance bandwidth.

Coll., India; NA","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","","2004","19","1","577","585","This paper presents a new approach to solving the short-term unit commitment problem using an evolutionary programming-based tabu search (TS) method. The objective of this paper is to find the generation scheduling such that the total operating cost can be minimized, when subjected to a variety of constraints. This also means that it is desirable to find the optimal generating unit commitment in the power system for the next H hours. Evolutionary programming, which happens to be a global optimization technique for solving unit commitment problem, operates on a system, which is designed to encode each unit's operating schedule with regard to its minimum up/down time. In this, the unit commitment schedule is coded as a string of symbols. An initial population of parent solutions is generated at random. Here, each schedule is formed by committing all of the units according to their initial status (""flat start""). Here, the parents are obtained from a predefined set of solutions (i.e., each and every solution is adjusted to meet the requirements). Then, a random decommitment is carried out with respect to the unit's minimum downtimes, and TS improves the status by avoiding entrapment in local minima. The best population is selected by evolutionary strategy. The Neyveli Thermal Power Station (NTPS) Unit-II in India demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach; extensive studies have also been performed for different power systems consisting of 10, 26, and 34 generating units. Numerical results are shown comparing the cost solutions and computation time obtained by using the evolutionary programming method and other conventional methods like dynamic programming, Lagrangian relaxation, and simulated annealing and tabu search in reaching proper unit commitment.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2003.821472","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1266616","","Search methods;Power generation;Genetic programming;Power system simulation;Dynamic programming;Costs;Power systems;Design optimization;Power system dynamics;Computational efficiency","power generation scheduling;evolutionary computation;search problems;power generation economics;costing;dynamic programming;thermal power stations","evolutionary programming-based tabu search;unit commitment problem;generation scheduling;total operating cost;optimal generating unit commitment;global optimization technique;Neyveli Thermal Power Station Unit II;dynamic programming;Lagrangian relaxation","","94","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

During sunny days, when the maximum power point of the photovoltaic (PV) array moves very slowly, the sampling interval T/sub a/ must be set as short as possible without causing instability. If the algorithm samples the array voltage and current too quickly, it is subjected to possible mistakes caused by the transient behavior of the PV array+converter system, thus missing temporarily the MPP. As a consequence, the algorithm can be confused, the energy efficiency decays, and the operating point can become unstable, entering disordered behaviors. The solution proposed in this paper lies in choosing T/sub a/ according to the converter's dynamics. The choice of the value of T/sub a/ according to the proposed approach ensures a three-level steady-state duty-cycle swing around the MPP, whatever the duty-cycle step-size and the irradiance level are. As an example, a boost MPPT battery charger has been studied.","","0-7803-8304-4","10.1109/ISIE.2004.1571953","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1571953","","Sampling methods;Voltage;Photovoltaic systems;Solar power generation;Steady-state;Batteries;Current-voltage characteristics;Power generation;Temperature;Fuzzy logic","perturbation techniques;power convertors;solar cell arrays","converter dynamic matching;perturb and observe maximum power point tracking;photovoltaic array;transient behavior;PV array converter system;three-level steady-state duty-cycle;boost battery charger","","22","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The particularities of the behavior of a DTC drive, when in the presence of inter-turn short circuits, are exploited, thus allowing the proposal of two different approaches for the diagnosis of this type of fault. One of the proposed diagnostic techniques is the well known motor current spectrum analysis. It is demonstrated that in a DTC induction motor drive, with stator inter-turn short circuits, the action of the torque and flux controllers introduce a strong third harmonic in the motor supply currents, which can be used to detect this type of fault. The other diagnostic technique is based on the multiple reference frames theory, recently proposed by the authors for the diagnosis of stator faults in line-connected motors. Here, its use is exploited in the diagnosis of stator faults in DTC induction motor drives. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the two proposed techniques for the diagnosis of stator faults but emphasize the fact that the multiple reference frames technique is the preferred one when the residual asymmetries of the motor are not negligible.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2004.834012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337063","","Stators;Induction motor drives;Fault diagnosis;Circuit faults;Torque control;Proposals;Induction motors;Current supplies;Electrical fault detection;Fault detection","induction motor drives;fault diagnosis;torque control;short-circuit currents;machine control;stators","stator fault diagnosis;direct torque control;induction motor drives;interturn short circuit;motor current spectrum analysis;flux control;multiple reference frames theory","","114","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Active power filters are typically connected in parallel to the harmonic/reactive current sources and cancel the harmonic/reactive components in the line current so that the current flow into and from the grid is sinusoidal and in phase with the grid voltage. Since the APFs process only the harmonic/reactive power, their power-handling capability can be much higher than that of the cascade power-factor-correction methods. In this paper, the one-cycle control method is extended to control three-phase APFs. The proposed control approach employs one integrator with reset along with several logic and linear components to control a voltage-source converter to achieve three-phase unity power factor for the current to and from the power grid. No multipliers or sensors for the load current and the APF inductor current are required. Furthermore, there is no need to calculate the reference for controlling APF inductor current so that complicated digital computation is eliminated. The operation switching frequency is constant that is desirable for industrial applications. The proposed control approach features great simplicity, excellent harmonic/reactive current cancellation, and solid stability. It is a cost-effective solution for power quality control for electronic equipment, buildings, industrial facilities, ships, airplanes, distributed power generation stations, etc. All findings are supported by experimental results.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2004.825223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1282034","","Active filters;Power harmonic filters;Power system harmonics;Distributed power generation;Reactive power;Voltage control;Inductors;Current measurement;Energy measurement;Power measurement","active filters;power system harmonics;integrating circuits;power convertors;power harmonic filters;power factor correction;electric current control;power supply quality;power control","one-cycle control;three-phase active power filter;vector operation;power line harmonics;reactive current source;nonlinear load;distributed energy source;harmonic/reactive power;integrator;logic component;linear component;voltage-source converter control;three-phase unity power factor;inductor current;switching frequency;power quality control;power-factor correction;PFC","","53","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared to high power converters, the control loop bandwidths for converters in the lower power range are generally much higher. Because of this, the dynamic properties of the uniformly-sampled pulse-width modulators used in low power applications become an important restriction to the maximum achievable bandwidth of control loops. Though frequency- and Laplace-domain models for uniformly-sampled pulse-width modulators are very valuable as they improve the general perception of the dynamic behavior of these modulators, the direct discrete design of the digital compensator requires a z-domain model for the combination modulator and converter For this purpose a new exact small-signal z-domain model is derived. In accordance with the zero-order-hold equivalent commonly used for 'regular' digital control systems, this z-domain model gives rise to the development of a uniformly-sampled pulse-width-modulator equivalent of the converter. This z-domain model is characterized by its capability to quantify the different dynamics of the converter for different modulators, its ease of use and its ability to predict the values of the control variables at the true sampling instants of the real system.","0275-9306","0-7803-8399-0","10.1109/PESC.2004.1354761","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1354761","","Digital control;Pulse modulation;Digital modulation;Bandwidth;Pulse width modulation converters;Digital signal processors;Switching converters;Signal processing algorithms;Space vector pulse width modulation;Frequency conversion","switching convertors;PWM power convertors;modulators;digital control;control engineering computing;power engineering computing;digital signal processing chips;frequency-domain analysis","digitally controlled converter;small-signal z-domain analysis;digital signal processor;power switching converter;flexible digital control algorithm;control loop bandwidth;uniformly-sampled pulse-width modulator;Laplace-domain model;frequency-domain model","","26","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study provides preliminary evidence that previous information technology acceptance research based on the technology acceptance model, may serve as a foundation for research of knowledge management system user acceptance. Relationships among primary TAM constructs are in substantive agreement with those characteristic of previous TAM research. Significant positive relationships between perceived usefulness, ease of use, and system usage were consistent with previous TAM research. The observed mediating role of perceived usefulness in the relationship between ease of use and usage was also in consonance with earlier findings.

In this paper, we describe a new high-resolution device capable of measuring local Young's modulus in very thin layers (1-5 mm) and devoted to the in vivo evaluation of the elastic properties of human skin. It uses an ultrasonic probe (50 MHz) for tracking the displacements induced by a 300 Hz shear wave generated by a ring surrounding the transducer. The displacements are measured using a conventional cross-correlation technique between successive ultrasonic back-scattered echoes. First, this noninvasive technique has been experimentally proven to be accurate for investigating elasticity in different skin-mimicking phantoms. Second, data were acquired in vivo on human forearms. As expected, Young's modulus was found to be higher in the dermis than in the hypodermis and other soft tissues.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2004.1324402","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1324402","","Humans;Skin;Elasticity;Biological tissues;Ultrasonic variables measurement;In vivo;Ultrasonic imaging;Viscosity;Mechanical factors;Biomedical imaging","biological organs;skin;biomechanics;biomedical ultrasonics;phantoms;Young's modulus;viscoelasticity;elastic waves;biomedical measurement","elastic parameter;human skin;dynamic elastography;sonoelastography;transient elastography;noninvasive characterization;viscoelastic properties;soft tissues;shear mechanical excitation;Young modulus;local tissue stiffness;medical imaging;cosmetic industries;palpation;shear wave;transducer;cross-correlation technique;ultrasonic back scattered echoes;skin-mimicking phantom;hypodermis;human forearms;elastic properties;ultrasound-based techniques;principle assessment parameter;in vivo evaluation;ultrasonic probe;displacement measurement;1 to 5 mm;50 MHz;300 Hz","Elasticity;Feasibility Studies;Forearm;Forearm;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Physical Examination;Physical Examination;Physical Stimulation;Physical Stimulation;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Skin;Skin Physiology;Transducers;Ultrasonography;Vibration","90","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The problem is formulated as a design of an integral operator whose kernel is required to satisfy a hyperbolic P(I)DE. The kernel P(I)DE is then converted into an equivalent integral equation and by applying the method of successive approximations, the equation's well posedness and the kernel's smoothness are established. It is shown how to extend this approach to design optimally stabilizing controllers. An adaptation mechanism is developed to reduce the conservativeness of the inverse optimal controller, and the performance bounds are derived. For a broad range of physically motivated special cases feedback laws are constructed explicitly and the closed-loop solutions are found in closed form. A numerical scheme for the kernel P(I)DE is proposed; its numerical effort compares favorably with that associated with operator Riccati equations.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2004.838495","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1369395","Backstepping;boundary control;distributed parameter systems;Lyapunov function;partial differential equations (PDEs);stabilization","State feedback;Integrodifferential equations;Backstepping;Optimal control;Riccati equations;Kernel;Control systems;Integral equations;Distributed control;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","state feedback;partial differential equations;integral equations;stability;optimal control","closed-form boundary state feedbacks;1D partial integrodifferential equations;boundary stabilization;linear parabolic integrodifferential equations;backstepping method;successive approximations;optimally stabilizing controllers;adaptation mechanism;inverse optimal controller","","326","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A log-periodic Zigzag antenna (LPZA) has acceptable performance in both gain and polarization. Its height however is large, at about one wavelength (1/spl lambda//sub L/). The concept of fractal antenna is employed in this antenna to achieve the necessary height reduction to /spl lambda//sub L//8, while keeping its radiation characteristics nearly constant. Both single and dual arm quasifractal log-periodic zigzag antenna (QFLPZA) configurations are investigated, with a maximum antenna height of only 1/8th of a wavelength, showing the desired radiation characteristics, and a wide impedance bandwidth of 67%.

An overview of common and new topologies of HV supplies and their typical properties is given. It is shown how these properties can be used to match the requirements of the different zones of an ESP regarding the actual operating conditions. Large particles and high dust loads can be addressed effectively using high-frequency dc power supplies. Fine particles, however, can be separated even more efficiently by pulsed power supplies. Additionally, the power consumption of different HV sources has been investigated in relation to the separation efficiency.

Instead of conventional rectangular apertures, two orthogonally placed bow-tie shaped apertures fed by a 3 dB branch line coupler are used to obtain wide band performance at S-band using a square radiating patch. A thick, low cost dielectric foam yields further improvement in bandwidth. In simulation, an impedance bandwidth of 28% and axial ratio bandwidth of 15% has been achieved with this geometry. An improvement of 5% in impedance bandwidth and 5.4% in ellipticity bandwidth is obtained over a conventional rectangular aperture.

The low-per node cost allows these wireless networks of sensors and actuators to be densely distributed. The nodes in these dense networks coordinate to perform the distributed sensing and actuation tasks. Moreover, as described in this paper, the nodes can also coordinate to exploit the redundancy provided by high density so as to extend overall system lifetime. The large number of nodes deployed in this systems preclude manual configuration, and the environmental dynamics precludes design-time preconfiguration. Therefore, nodes have to self-configure to establish a topology that provides communication under stringent energy constraints. ASCENT builds on the notion that, as density increases, only a subset of the nodes is necessary to establish a routing forwarding backbone. In ASCENT, each node assesses its connectivity and adapts its participation in the multihop network topology based on the measured operating region. This paper motivates and describes the ASCENT algorithm and presents analysis, simulation, and experimental measurements. We show that the system achieves linear increase in energy savings as a function of the density and the convergence time required in case of node failures while still providing adequate connectivity.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2004.16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1318596","Index Terms- Wireless sensor networks;adaptive topology;topology control;energy conservation.","Adaptive systems;Network topology;Intelligent sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Microsensors;Monitoring;Costs;Actuators;Routing;Spine","network topology;intelligent sensors;wireless sensor networks;telecommunication network routing;condition monitoring","adaptive self-configuring sensor networks topology;microsensors;radio technology;smart sensors;environmental monitoring;wireless networks;actuators;distributed sensing;environmental dynamics;design-time preconfiguration;routing forwarding backbone;multihop network topology","","292","","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most of the previously developed closed pattern mining algorithms work under the candidate maintenance-and-test paradigm which is inherently costly in both runtime and space usage when the support threshold is low or the patterns become long. We present, BIDE, an efficient algorithm for mining frequent closed sequences without candidate maintenance. We adopt a novel sequence closure checking scheme called bidirectional extension, and prunes the search space more deeply compared to the previous algorithms by using the BackScan pruning method and the Scan-Skip optimization technique. A thorough performance study with both sparse and dense real-life data sets has demonstrated that BIDE significantly outperforms the previous algorithms: it consumes order(s) of magnitude less memory and can be more than an order of magnitude faster.

The latter class is considered the primary subject for the robotic psychology and robotherapy, approaches that have been developed by the authors. These new fields consist of a concept that places the relationships between humans and robots into a psychological, rather than technological, context.

In this paper, we compare four well known scenario-based SA evaluation methods using an evaluation framework. The framework considers each method from the point of view of method context, stakeholders, structure, and reliability. The comparison reveals that most of the studied methods are structurally similar but there are a number of differences among their activities and techniques.

ICRA '04. 2004","","2004","2","","1843","1848 Vol.2","In this paper, several vision-based robot control methods are classified following an analogy with well known minimization methods. Comparing the rate of convergence between minimization algorithms helps us to understand the difference of performance of the control schemes. In particular, it is shown that standard vision-based control methods have in general low rates of convergence. Thus, the performance of vision-based control could be improved using schemes which perform like the Newton minimization algorithm that has a high convergence rate. Unfortunately, the Newton minimization method needs the computation of second derivatives that can be ill-conditioned causing convergence problems. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes two new control schemes based on efficient second-order minimization techniques.","1050-4729","0-7803-8232-3","10.1109/ROBOT.2004.1308092","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1308092","","Minimization methods;Convergence;Cost function;Robot kinematics;Robot control;Least squares methods;Visual servoing;Robot vision systems;Feedback;Robot motion","robot vision;position control;minimisation;Newton method;convergence of numerical methods;image motion analysis","vision based robot control;second order minimization;Newton minimization algorithm;convergence rate;position control;image motion analysis","","150","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This single-phase rectifier presents reduced conduction losses because the current flows through two power semiconductors only, for any stage of operation. The family of lossless passive snubbers presented in this paper guarantees soft-commutation during the turn-on and the turn-off intervals of the switch within a large range of variation of the input current. The snubber circuit not only should slow the di/dt and dv/dt rates of the active switch, but also losslessly recover the energy stored in the zero-current inductor and in the zero-voltage capacitor, leading to reduced voltage stress across the switches and diodes. The association of the family of high performance snubber circuits here presented with the single-phase rectifier with reduced conduction losses results in a high efficiency rectifier, free from overvoltages across the power switches. To access the performance of the proposed family, simulation and experimental results for a single-phase rectifier 3000W laboratory prototype using one snubber of the family are also presented.","1548-0992","","10.1109/TLA.2004.1468625","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1468625","soft switching;PWM;passive snubbers","Snubbers;Reactive power;Rectifiers;Switching circuits;Power semiconductor switches;Active inductors;Switched capacitor circuits;Zero voltage switching;Stress;Semiconductor diodes","","soft switching;PWM;passive snubbers","","5","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The key advantages of shape-memory polymers are their low material/fabrication cost coupled with their simplicity of integration/operation. In the present study, shape-memory polymers are spin coated onto a standard Si wafer and polymerized by thermal annealing. The thermomechanics of strain storage and recovery in the polymer films are studied using instrumented microindentation. The sharp microindents demonstrate full recovery at all load levels, establishing the feasibility of microscale actuation. The microindentation response of the polymer film is shown to depend on temperature and the cooling cycle during indentation. In turn, the subsequent recovery behavior of an indent depends on the thermal history during indentation. Indents performed at higher temperatures are larger in size, but have smaller stored strain energy compared to indents performed at low temperature. The larger stored strain energy in low temperature indents results in lower shape recovery temperatures. The effects of indentation temperature and load are systematically investigated to provide a framework for the use of shape-memory polymers in microsystems. Application of shape-memory polymers is demonstrated through the development of an active microfluidic reservoir. The reservoir was created by indentation at the end of a microfluidic channel and was activated by local heating. The collapse of the filled reservoir caused the motion of fluid down the microfluidic channel.","1941-0158","","10.1109/JMEMS.2004.828727","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1303625","","Microelectromechanical systems;Polymer films;Temperature;Capacitive sensors;Microfluidics;Reservoirs;Micromechanical devices;Heat recovery;Fabrication;Costs","micromechanical devices;polymers;shape memory effects;thin films;deformation;indentation;spin coating;rapid thermal annealing;silicon","shape-memory polymers;microelectromechanical systems;thin films;large-strain deformations;small-scale transduction;material-fabrication cost;thermal annealing;strain storage;polymer films;instrumented microindentation;microscale actuation;microindentation response;polymer film;cooling cycle;recovery behaviour;shape recovery temperatures;indentation temperature;microfluidic reservoir;microfluidic channel;local heating;filled reservoir;soft lithograph;Si","","127","","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is based on a nonparametric extension of scatter matrices. There are at least two advantages to using the proposed nonparametric scatter matrices. First, they are generally of full rank. This provides the ability to specify the number of extracted features desired and to reduce the effect of the singularity problem. This is in contrast to parametric discriminant analysis, which usually only can extract L-1 (number of classes minus one) features. In a real situation, this may not be enough. Second, the nonparametric nature of scatter matrices reduces the effects of outliers and works well even for nonnormal datasets. The new method provides greater weight to samples near the expected decision boundary.

In particular, artifacts that may arise in 3-D TV systems are addressed, such as keystone distortion, depth-plane curvature, puppet theater effect, cross talk, cardboard effect, shear distortion, picket-fence effect, and image flipping.

The nonlinear effect of bias circuits on the dc sourcing characteristics has been analyzed with simplified circuits for power amplifiers using the Volterra series. The analysis shows that the second-order distortion generated by a bias buffer transistor can boost bias level of the RF transistor to compensate finite DSC available in the absence of this effect. The bias-level boosting due to RF injection can be optimized by tuning the value of a series resistor between the emitter of the buffer transistor and the base of the RF transistor. Amplifiers with different series resistors have been implemented and tested with an IS95-B code-division multiple-access signal at the cellular band (824-849 MHz).

The elements of the residual vector and the Jacobian matrix for the AC network are kept unchanged and are merely complemented by a new vector and a new matrix, which represent the modifications due to the DC link.

It will be shown that in the stretched and irradiated 68/32 mol% copolymer, a transverse strain of 4.5% and a transverse electromechanical coupling factor k/sub 31/ of 0.65 can be induced under a field of 85 MV/m. In addition, the irradiated copolymer also exhibits a high elastic energy density, /spl sim/ 1 J/cm/sup 3/. For PVDF based terpolymers such as P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) terpolymer (CFE: chlorofluoroethylene), an electrostrictive strain of more than 7% can be obtained. To elucidate the microstructure changes due to the defects modification in P(VDF-TrFE) based polymers, synchrotron X-ray measurement was carried out on the irradiated copolymers and the results show that, the irradiation converts the polar-phase into a nonpolar phase. In addition, X-ray date show that the polar-phase can be induced, at the expense of the nonpolar phase, by external fields, confirming that the field induced conformation change is responsible for the observed high electromechanical responses. Although the modified PVDF based polymer exhibits the highest room temperature dielectric constant (60 versus below 10), it is still far below those in the inorganic materials. Experimental results show that by using delocalized electrons in conjugated bonds an all-organic composite with a dielectric constant more than 400 can be achieved. As a result, a strain of near 2% with an elastic energy density higher than 0.1 J/cm/sup 3/ can be induced under a low applied field of 13 V//spl mu/m.

Despite recent advances, the understanding, prediction and control of biped balance in realistic dynamical situations remain an unsolved problem and the subject of much research in robotics and biomechanics. Here we study the fundamental mechanics of the rotational stability of multi-body systems with the goal of identifying a general stability criterion. Our research focuses on H/sub G/, the rate of change of centroidal angular momentum of a robot, as the physical quantity containing its stability information.

For free walk on horizontal ground, a derived criterion refers to a point on the foot/ground surface of a robot where the total ground reaction force would have to act such that H/sub G/=0.

In this paper, a double-sampling technique is introduced for this type of converter. It is based on a variant of the fully floating bilinear integrator. This way, the clock frequency of the converter is almost halved. An experimental converter was designed in a 0.6-/spl mu/m CMOS technology for a bandwidth of 500 kHz at a 3.3-V supply. In the switched-capacitor implementation, the hardware is extensively reused. This way, the converter can be realized with only one operational amplifier. On the other hand, compared to alternative implementations, the amount of switches is increased. These are designed carefully in order not to degrade the performance. The converter converts a sample in 24 clock cycles and achieves a dynamic range of 87 dB. The peak signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio (SNDR) were measured to be 82 and 81 dB, respectively. The power consumption was 28-mW analog and 20-mW digital.

Routing based on a connected dominating set is a promising approach, where the search space for a route is reduced to the hosts in the set. A set is dominating if all the hosts in the system are either in the set or neighbors of hosts in the set. The efficiency of dominating-set-based routing mainly depends on the overhead introduced in the formation of the dominating set and the size of the dominating set. In this paper, we first review a localized formation of a connected dominating set called marking process and dominating-set-based routing. Then, we propose a dominant pruning rule to reduce the size of the dominating set. This dominant pruning rule (called Rule k) is a generalization of two existing rules (called Rule 1 and Rule 2, respectively). We prove that the vertex set derived by applying Rule k is still a connected dominating set. Rule k is more effective in reducing the dominating set derived from the marking process than the combination of Rules 1 and 2 and, surprisingly, in a restricted implementation with local neighborhood information, Rule k has the same communication complexity and less computation complexity. Simulation results confirm that Rule k outperforms Rules 1 and 2, especially in networks with relatively high vertex degree and high percentage of unidirectional links. We also prove that an upper bound exists on the average size of the dominating set derived from Rule k in its restricted implementation.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2004.48","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1327595","Ad hoc wireless networks;dominant pruning;dominating sets;routing;probabilistic analysis;simulation.","Intelligent networks;Wireless networks;Ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Complexity theory;Computational modeling;Upper bound;Analytical models;Energy states;Maintenance","ad hoc networks;wireless LAN;telecommunication network routing;probability;communication complexity;search problems;graph theory;set theory","ad hoc wireless networks;dominant pruning rule;dominating sets;probabilistic analysis;network routing;search space;localized formation;communication complexity;simulation","","338","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article gives a brief overview of theoretical advances, computing trends, applications and future perspectives in parallel genetic algorithms. It explains basic terms and behavior of (parallel) genetic algorithms. Genetic algorithms are easily parallelized algorithms, therefore two kinds of possible parallelism, data parallelism and control parallelism, are mentioned and described towards them. Parallelism of genetic algorithms brings many advantages and gains. Classifications of these algorithms are often based on the type of computing model, a walk strategy and the used computing machinery. Afterwards significant milestones in the theory with latest advances are briefly mentioned. Then current trends in parallel computing with stress computer architectures of parallel systems, interconnection topologies, operating systems, parallel (genetic) libraries and programming paradigms are reviewed shortly. The sufficient space is devoted to the latest applications of parallel genetic algorithms. After the discussion section, perspectives of the algorithms are predicted till the year 2005. The information in the article is segregated into two periods before and after the year 2000 in all chapters. The second period is more interesting and of higher importance, because it highlights recent research efforts and gives some hints about possible future trends. That is why we devote much space to the second period. As there is no such an overview of the recent period of parallel genetic algorithms, our investigation could be appealing and useful in many aspects.","","0-7695-2132-0","10.1109/IPDPS.2004.1303155","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1303155","","Genetic algorithms;Computer applications;Concurrent computing;Parallel processing;Classification algorithms;Machinery;Stress;Computer architecture;Topology;Operating systems","genetic algorithms;parallel algorithms;parallel architectures;parallel programming;operating systems (computers)","parallel genetic algorithms;data parallelism;control parallelism;parallel computing;computer architectures;operating systems;parallel libraries","","31","","61","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has been shown that using the peer-to-peer network model, a mode of communication typically seen in ad hoc wireless networks, can result in performance improvements such as increased data rate, reduced transmission power, better load balancing, and enhanced network coverage. However, the true impact of adopting the peer-to-peer network model in such an environment is yet to be fully understood. In this paper, we investigate the performance benefits and drawbacks of using the peer-to-peer network model for Internet access in cellular wireless data networks. We find that, although the peer-to-peer network model has significantly better spatial reuse characteristics, the improved spatial reuse does not translate into better throughput performance. Instead, we observe that using the peer-to-peer network model as-is might actually degrade the throughput performance of the network. We identify and discuss the reasons behind these observations. Using the insights gained through the performance evaluations, we then propose two categories of approaches to improve the performance of the peer-to-peer network model: approaches that leverage assistance from the base station and approaches that leverage the relaying capability of multihomed hosts. Through simulation results, we show that using the peer-to-peer network model in cellular wireless data networks is a promising approach when the network model is complemented with appropriate mechanisms.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2004.1261817","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1261817","","Peer to peer computing;Cellular networks;Wireless communication;Throughput;Wireless networks;Load management;IP networks;Degradation;Base stations;Relays","cellular radio;ad hoc networks;data communication;protocols","cellular wireless data networks;peer-to-peer network model;ad hoc wireless networks;Internet access;multihomed hosts;multihop network;peer relay;converged architecture","","88","","47","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Kepler scientific workflow system provides domain scientists with an easy-to-use yet powerful system for capturing scientific workflows (SWFs). SWFs are a formalization of the ad-hoc process that a scientist may go through to get from raw data to publishable results. Kepler attempts to streamline the workflow creation and execution process so that scientists can design, execute, monitor, re-run, and communicate analytical procedures repeatedly with minimal effort. Kepler is unique in that it seamlessly combines high-level workflow design with execution and runtime interaction, access to local and remote data, and local and remote service invocation. SWFs are superficially similar to business process workflows but have several challenges not present in the business workflow scenario. For example, they often operate on large, complex and heterogeneous data, can be computationally intensive and produce complex derived data products that may be archived for use in reparameterized runs or other workflows. Moreover, unlike business workflows, SWFs are often dataflow-oriented as witnessed by a number of recent academic systems (e.g., DiscoveryNet, Taverna and Triana) and commercial systems (Scitegic/Pipeline-Pilot, Inforsense). In a sense, SWFs are often closer to signal-processing and data streaming applications than they are to control-oriented business workflow applications.","1099-3371","0-7695-2146-0","10.1109/SSDM.2004.1311241","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1311241","","Prototypes;Business;Web services;Runtime;Java;Plugs;Yarn;Supercomputers;Biological system modeling;Power system modeling","workflow management software;database management systems;scientific information systems;data handling;data flow computing","extensible system;scientific workflow design;scientific workflow execution;scientific analysis;software environment;hardware environment;data export;data import;Kepler scientific workflow system;workflow creation;high-level workflow design;runtime interaction;data access;service invocation;large data;complex data;heterogeneous data;data products;DiscoveryNet;Taverna;Triana;Scitegic/Pipeline-Pilot;Inforsense;data streaming","","319","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The general approach is then to use optimization techniques to control the measurement process in order to achieve accurate target state estimation. We are concerned primarily with the deployment and utilization of limited sensor resources. We also allow for measurement origin uncertainty, with sensor measurements either target-generated or false alarms. An example in which the aim is to track a submarine by deploying a series of constant false-alarm rate passive sonobuoys is presented. We show that by making some standard assumptions, the effect of the measurement origin uncertainty can be expressed as a state-dependent information reduction factor which can be calculated off-line. This enables the Fisher information matrix (FIM) to be calculated quickly, allowing Cramer-Rao bounds to be utilized for real-time, dynamic sensor management. The sensor management framework is shown to determine deployment strategies that enable the target to be accurately localized, and at the same time efficiently utilize the limited sensor resources.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2004.1309993","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1309993","","State estimation;Target tracking;Radar tracking;Sensor arrays;Measurement uncertainty;Sensor systems;Process control;Underwater vehicles;Resource management;Data engineering","sensor fusion;distributed sensors;target tracking;sonar tracking;radar tracking;clutter;optimisation;state estimation;matrix algebra","multisensor resource deployment;multiple sensors;target tracking;clutter;target state estimation;posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound;unbiased estimators;unknown target state;optimization techniques;submarine tracking;constant false-alarm rate passive sonobuoys;state-dependent information reduction factor;Fisher information matrix;dynamic sensor management;sensor management framework","","127","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The drawback of a time-interleaved ADC system is that the ADCs are not exactly identical due to errors in the manufacturing process. This means that time, gain, and offset mismatch errors are introduced in the ADC system. These errors cause distortion in the sampled signal. In this paper, we present a method for estimation and compensation of the mismatch errors. The estimation method requires no knowledge about the input signal except that it should be bandlimited to the Nyquist frequency for the complete ADC system. This means that the errors can be estimated while the ADC is running. The method is also adaptive to slow changes in the mismatch errors. The estimation method has been validated with simulations and measurements from a time-interleaved ADC system.","1558-0806","","10.1109/TCSI.2003.821300","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259496","","Blind equalizers;Adaptive equalizers;Sampling methods;Distortion;Estimation error;Calibration;Frequency estimation;Filtering;Clocks;Manufacturing processes","analogue-digital conversion;error compensation;interpolation;timing jitter;blind equalisers;adaptive equalisers;Nyquist diagrams;signal sampling","time-interleaved ADC;sampling rate;blind adaptive equalization;mismatch errors;nonuniform sampling;errors estimation;errors compensation;Nyquist frequency;time errors;gain errors;amplitude offset errors;static jitter","","94","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Turbo space-time multiuser detection (ST MUD) is employed for intracell communications and is shown to closely approach the ultimate capacity limits in Gaussian ambient noise for an isolated cell. Then, it is combined with various multiuser detection methods for combating intercell interference. Among various multiuser detection techniques examined, linear minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) MUD and successive interference cancellation are shown to be feasible and effective. Based on these two multiuser detection schemes, one of which may outperform the other for different settings, an adaptive detection scheme is developed, which together with a Turbo ST MUD structure offers substantial performance gain over the well-known V-BLAST techniques with coding in this interference-limited cellular environment. The obtained multiuser capacity is excellent in the high to medium signal-to-interference ratio scenario. Nonetheless, numerical results also indicate that a further increase in system complexity, using base-station cooperation, could lead to further significant increases of the system capacity. The asymptotic multicell MIMO capacity with linear MMSE MUD preprocessing is also derived, and this analysis agrees well with the simulation results.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2003.821168","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1271237","","Downlink;MIMO;Multiuser detection;Interchannel interference;Receiving antennas;Gaussian noise;Noise cancellation;Antenna arrays;Signal processing;Interference cancellation","radio links;MIMO systems;multiuser detection;interference suppression;cellular radio;cochannel interference;Gaussian noise;least mean squares methods;space-time adaptive processing","downlink capacity;interference-limited MIMO systems;multiple input multiple output;joint detection;cellular systems;cochannel interference;signal processing;space-time multiuser detection;intracell communications;Gaussian ambient noise;intercell interference;MMSE;minimum mean square error;interference cancellation;V-BLAST techniques;coding;signal-to-interference ratio;base-station cooperation;turbo processing","","185","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Multimodal interaction is part of everyday human discourse: We speak, move, gesture, and shift our gaze in an effective flow of communication. Recent initiatives such as perceptual and attentive user interfaces put these natural human behaviors in the center of the human-computer interaction (HCI). We've designed a generic modeling framework for specifying multimodal HCI using the Object Management Group's Unified Modeling Language. Because it's a well-known and widely supported standard - computer science departments typically cover it in undergraduate courses, and many books, training courses, and tools support it - UML makes it easier for software engineers unfamiliar with multimodal research to apply HCI knowledge, resulting in broader and more practical effects. Standardization provides a significant driving force for further progress because it codifies best practices, enables and encourages reuse, and facilitates interworking between complementary tools.","1558-0814","","10.1109/MC.2004.139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1333009","","Unified modeling language;Human computer interaction;User interfaces;Software standards;Computer science;Books;Management training;Software tools;Knowledge engineering;Standardization","human computer interaction;user interfaces;specification languages;software engineering;research initiatives","multimodal human-computer interaction;Unified Modeling Language;user interface;computer science department;undergraduate course","","44","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Inst., Troy, NY, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","","2004","53","4","1076","1084","This paper describes a neural network (NN) model of a real vehicle and the associated hybrid learning scheme. The NN vehicle models the actual vehicle dynamic behavior with the architecture of a real-time recurrent network. The NN was trained to predict the next state of the vehicle, given the current vehicle state, the current input steering angle of the front wheel, and the vehicle's speed. A hybrid training scheme for the network has been proposed, which consists of two phases: open-loop training for stabilization of the NN weight learning and closed-loop training for long-term prediction of the vehicle behavior. The open-loop training is necessary to avoid learning instability at initial stages. The closed-loop training then follows in such a way that the NN correctly predicts the vehicle's next state in a recursive mode. The outcome is that the model can correctly generate the vehicle trajectory, given the initial state and the steering and speed sequence of the vehicle. Furthermore, after this training procedure, it not only learns the vehicle's lateral dynamics along the trained trajectories, but can also generalize to similar trajectories. This modeling technique has been successfully applied to model the actual dynamics of a Daewoo Leganza vehicle. It is an intelligent vehicle that is fully autonomous in that steering, braking, and accelerating were all done via computer control. The training data were taken from a four-vehicle platoon demonstration in which four vehicles were automatically controlled in a convoy mode.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2004.830145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1317211","","Predictive models;Vehicle dynamics;Neural networks;Remotely operated vehicles;Automatic control;Mathematical model;Intelligent vehicles;Acceleration;Biological neural networks;Nonlinear equations","learning (artificial intelligence);evolutionary computation;position control;road vehicles;control system synthesis;fuzzy control;intelligent control;real-time systems;vehicle dynamics;recurrent neural nets","vehicle dynamics;vehicle measurement;neural networks model;hybrid learning scheme;long-term prediction;real-time recurrent network;open-loop training;closed-loop training;intelligent vehicle","","19","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Assuming that this estimate is obtained by correlation using a known training sequence of K symbols embedded in the useful signal, we proceed to develop a fully analytical assessment of the impact of estimation error on the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the array. The originality of the approach revolves around the derivation of the distribution of the normalized SNR, that is the real SNR normalized to the ideal (i.e., perfect estimation) SNR. The end result is a set of distributions which can potentially reduce or in certain cases eliminate the need for simulation to determine certain design parameters such as array size, training sequence length, etc. These are then applied to find closed-form expressions for the outage probability and the error probability in differential phase-shift keying and quarternary phase-shift keying after training in uncorrelated Rayleigh fading.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2004.828022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1310306","","Diversity reception;Channel estimation;Adaptive arrays;Antenna arrays;Phased arrays;Fading;Interchannel interference;Phase estimation;Signal analysis;Estimation error","channel estimation;adaptive antenna arrays;error statistics;Rayleigh channels;differential phase shift keying;cochannel interference","maximal-ratio combining architecture;channel estimation;training sequence;adaptive antenna array;spatial signature estimation;estimation error;signal to noise ratio;SNR;error probability;outage probability;differential-phase shift keying;uncorrelated Rayleigh fading","","33","","43","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method is based on a new modified Kalman filter (MKF). The time-varying channel is modeled as an autoregressive (AR) process and the proposed MKF is used to estimate this AR parameter. In addition, to track the time-varying channel, a channel predictor using regression analysis and the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) time-domain equalizer are also proposed. The simulation results show that the proposed channel estimator can effectively compensate for ICI.","1558-4127","","10.1109/TCE.2004.1309406","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1309406","","Channel estimation;OFDM;Fading;Time-varying channels;Frequency estimation;Interchannel interference;Parameter estimation;Regression analysis;Time domain analysis;Equalizers","channel estimation;OFDM modulation;Rayleigh channels;Kalman filters;time-varying channels;adjacent channel interference;autoregressive processes;regression analysis;least mean squares methods;equalisers","frequency-domain channel estimation;OFDM system;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;fast fading channel;modified Kalman filter;time-varying channel;interchannel interference;frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channel;autoregressive process;regression analysis;minimum mean-squared error time-domain equalizer","","44","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, a new collision-avoidance condition is developed for the dynamically changing environment, which consists of a time criterion and a geometrical criterion, and it has explicit physical meanings in both the transformed space and the original working space. By imposing the avoidance condition, one can determine one (or a class of) collision-free path(s) in a closed form.

To reduce the incidence of rework throughout the construction supply chain, data from 161 completed projects were gathered using a questionnaire survey. Stepwise multiple regression was used to determine the significant variables that contributed to rework in projects. In conjunction with previously reported research, these variables were used to develop an alternative procurement model for reducing rework in projects.

The FE method enables accurate analysis to get the effects of armature reaction, especially in PM motors. Analysis is carried out on a 3-hp, three-phase, 48-V, 16-pole, 800-r/min axial-flux PM brushless dc motor designed for the direct drive of an electric two wheeler. The slotless stator sandwiched by two disc rotors is the topology of the motor. The rated torque is 48.19 N /spl middot/ m, and the peak torque required for acceleration of the vehicle is 80 N /spl middot/ m. In the analysis, the stator coils of the motor are excited at no-load, full-load, and peak-load conditions, and the effects of these loadings on the developed torque as well as flux densities in different parts of the motor are observed. It is observed that the reduction in flux density is not linear with the armature current but increases drastically with the current. At peak load, the air-gap flux density is 0.087 T and the reduction in peak torque because or armature reaction is calculated as 2.8%. The coil inductance comprises the air-gap inductance and the end-turn inductance. Slot leakage inductance is not considered because of the slotless geometry of the stator.

Local analysis of the pectoral muscle may be used to identify the presence of abnormal axillary lymph nodes, which may be the only manifestation of occult breast carcinoma. We propose a new method for the identification of the pectoral muscle in MLO mammograms based upon a multiresolution technique using Gabor wavelets. This new method overcomes the limitation of the straight-line representation considered in our initial investigation using the Hough transform. The method starts by convolving a group of Gabor filters, specially designed for enhancing the pectoral muscle edge, with the region of interest containing the pectoral muscle. After computing the magnitude and phase images using a vector-summation procedure, the magnitude value of each pixel is propagated in the direction of the phase. The resulting image is then used to detect the relevant edges. Finally, a post-processing stage is used to find the true pectoral muscle edge. The method was applied to 84 MLO mammograms from the Mini-MIAS (Mammographic Image Analysis Society, London, U.K.) database. Evaluation of the pectoral muscle edge detected in the mammograms was performed based upon the percentage of false-positive (FP) and false-negative (FN) pixels determined by comparison between the numbers of pixels enclosed in the regions delimited by the edges identified by a radiologist and by the proposed method. The average FP and FN rates were, respectively, 0.58% and 5.77%. Furthermore, the results of the Gabor-filter-based method indicated low Hausdorff distances with respect to the hand-drawn pectoral muscle edges, with the mean and standard deviation being 3.84/spl plusmn/1.73 mm over 84 images.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2003.823062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1263612","","Muscles;Image edge detection;Image processing;Cancer detection;Breast cancer;Lymph nodes;Gabor filters;Pixel;Image databases;Performance evaluation","muscle;mammography;medical image processing;cancer;image resolution;convolution;edge detection;image enhancement;Hough transforms;filtering theory;image segmentation;image representation","automatic pectoral muscle identification;mammograms;medio-lateral oblique views;intensity-based image processing methods;breast cancer detection;abnormal axillary lymph nodes;occult breast carcinoma;multiresolution technique;Gabor wavelets;Gabor filters;convolution;phase images;vector-summation procedure;post-processing stage;Mini-MIAS database;Mammographic Image Analysis Society;London;false-positive pixels;false-negative pixels;low Hausdorff distances;hand-drawn pectoral muscle edges;Hough transform;2.11 to 5.57 mm","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Humans;Mammography;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Pectoralis Muscles;Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","139","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous research has been focusing on reliability prediction based on degradation modeling at the component failure mechanism level. In reality, a system may consist of multiple components or a component may have multiple degradation paths, so it is necessary to simultaneously consider multiple degradation measures. Also, many research efforts on degradation analysis were initiated by making assumptions about the degradation mechanism. In reality often there is very limited understanding about the degradation mechanism. When the observed degradation data is collected, it is often not known which degradation model is applicable. In this paper, a general analysis procedure is developed. Simulated data were used to illustrate the applicability of this approach. It was verified that, when the multiple degradation measures in a system are correlated, an incorrect independence assumption might underestimate the system reliability.","","0-7803-8215-3","10.1109/RAMS.2004.1285465","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1285465","","Degradation;Predictive models;Power system modeling;Failure analysis;Data analysis;Stress;Hazards;Time measurement;Fuel cells;Reliability","failure analysis;reliability theory","reliability prediction;degradation modeling;multiple degradation measures;system reliability;correlated degradation paths","","29","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The RLM algorithm minimizes a robust M-estimator-based cost function instead of the conventional mean square error function (MSE). Previous work has showed that the RLM algorithm offers improved robustness to impulses over conventional recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm. In this paper, the mean and mean square convergence behaviors of the RLM algorithm under the contaminated Gaussian impulsive noise model is analyzed. A lattice structure-based fast RLM algorithm, called the Huber Prior Error Feedback-Least Squares Lattice (H-PEF-LSL) algorithm is derived. Part of the H-PEF-LSL algorithm was presented in ICASSP 2001. It has an order O(N) arithmetic complexity, where N is the length of the adaptive filter, and can be viewed as a fast implementation of the RLM algorithm based on the modified Huber M-estimate function and the conventional PEF-LSL adaptive filtering algorithm. Simulation results show that the transversal RLM and the H-PEF-LSL algorithms have better performance than the conventional RLS and other RLS-like robust adaptive algorithms tested when the desired and input signals are corrupted by impulsive noise.

In the first section, we focus on the ability of using reflecting targets embedded in the body as sources of time reversal waves. Real time tracking and destruction of moving kidney stones are demonstrated in the case of lithotripsy application. We show the strong potential of iterative time reversal techniques in multiple target environments to select and focus in real time on each target of a medium. The ability of iterative time reversal to improve the detection of microcalcifications in a random scattering media (speckle noise) is also presented. We show that distortions induced by sound velocity heterogeneities are compensated by the iterative time reversal technique guaranteeing the maximum pressure to be reached at the target position. In the second section of this paper, we discuss the time reversal focusing properties observed in dissipative media like the skull. We show that the time reversal focal spot can be strongly degraded as, in such medium, we can no more rely on the time reversal invariance of the wave equation. Important sidelobes appear around the main focus. However, combining time reversal with amplitude compensation techniques allows correction of absorption effects and decreasing of these sidelobes. Application of this coupled technique to high precision brain hyperthermia through the skull is demonstrated. Beyond these straightforward applications of time reversal to spatial focusing of waves through aberrating medium, we show that time reversal techniques allow us also to revisit the concept of piezoelectric transducer designing. Contrary to conventional transducer technology avoiding unwanted reverberations in piezoelectric elements, time reversal can take benefit of strongly reverberating media to increase the transducer efficiency. We demonstrate that very high pressure fields (1000 Atm.) can be obtained with a few transducers connected to reverberating media such as solid waveguides. The dispersive property of waveguides; is compensated by time reversal allowing very long coded excitations to be recompressed in very short high amplitude pulses. It leads to a new generation of ultra-compact shock wave lithotripters that use a very small transducer number and to time reversal kaleidoscopes that can replace the 2D array.","1051-0117","0-7803-8412-1","10.1109/ULTSYM.2004.1417870","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1417870","","Piezoelectric transducers;Skull;Target tracking;Lithotripsy;Acoustic scattering;Random media;Speckle;Acoustic noise;Working environment noise;Acoustic distortion","kidney;biomedical ultrasonics;target tracking;ultrasonic scattering;absorbing media;speckle;hyperthermia;brain;ultrasonic focusing;piezoelectric transducers;reverberation;shock waves;iterative methods","time reversal acoustics;multiple target environments;microcalcifications;random scattering media;speckle noise;sound velocity heterogeneities;time reversal focusing;dissipative media;skull;time reversal focal spot;amplitude compensation;absorption effect correction;decreased sidelobes;high precision brain hyperthermia;spatial focusing;aberrating medium;piezoelectric transducer design;strongly reverberating media;transducer efficiency;very high pressure fields;solid waveguides;very long coded excitations;recompression;very short high amplitude pulses;ultra-compact shock wave lithotripters;time reversal kaleidoscopes;reflecting targets;body;real time tracking;moving kidney stone destruction;lithotripsy;iterative time reversal techniques","","11","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thanks to a simple mechanism for predicting criterion values, a considerable amount of time can be saved by avoiding many slow criterion evaluations. We propose two implementations of the proposed prediction mechanism that are suitable for use with nonrecursive and recursive criterion forms, respectively. Both algorithms find the optimum usually several times faster than any other known branch & bound algorithm. As the algorithm computational efficiency is crucial, due to the exponential nature of the search problem, we also investigate other factors that affect the search performance of all branch & bound algorithms. Using a set of synthetic criteria, we show that the speed of the branch & bound algorithms strongly depends on the diversity among features, feature stability with respect to different subsets, and criterion function dependence on feature set size. We identify the scenarios where the search is accelerated the most dramatically (finish in linear time), as well as the worst conditions. We verify our conclusions experimentally on three real data sets using traditional probabilistic distance criteria.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2004.28","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1300560","Subset search;feature selection;search tree;optimum search;subset selection;dimensionality reduction;artificial intelligence.","Computational efficiency;Acceleration;Artificial intelligence;Search problems;Stability criteria;Computational complexity;Size measurement;Search methods;Performance gain","tree searching;trees (mathematics);feature extraction;set theory;prediction theory;recursive functions;probabilistic logic;computational complexity;pattern recognition","search problem;tree searching;fast branch and bound algorithm;optimal feature subset selection;prediction mechanism;feature set;nonrecursive criterion;recursive criterion;feature stability;probabilistic distance criteria;probabilistic logic","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated","157","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

But maximum voltage transfer ratio of matrix converter is limited to 50%. This is the major disadvantage of matrix converter. This limitation can be overcome by eliminating third harmonics by injecting third harmonic voltage in the input voltage; the maximum voltage transfer ratio 100% is achieved.

The basic ideal and major advantage of this method is to reuse information that is used during QRS detection, a necessary step for most ECG classification algorithm, for VPC detection. To reduce the influence of different artifacts, the filter bank property of quadratic spline WT is explored. The QRS duration in scale three and the area under the QRS complex in scale four are selected as the characteristic features. It is found that the R wave amplitude has a marked influence on the computation of proposed characteristic features. Thus, it is necessary to normalize these features. This normalization process can reduce the effect of alternating R wave amplitude and achieve reliable VPC detection. After normalization and excluding the left bundle branch block beats, the accuracies for VPC classification using FNN is 99.79%. Features that are extracted using quadratic spline wavelet were used successfully by previous investigators for QRS detection. In this study, using the same wavelet, it is demonstrated that the proposed feature extraction method from different WT scales can effectively eliminate the influence of high and low-frequency noise and achieve reliable VPC classification. The two primary advantages of using same wavelet for QRS detection and VPC classification are less computation and less complexity during actual implementation.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2004.824131","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1306579","","Wavelet transforms;Fuzzy neural networks;Electrocardiography;Spline;Artificial neural networks;Heart rate variability;Feature extraction;Neural networks;Biomedical engineering;Classification algorithms","electrocardiography;medical signal processing;wavelet transforms;fuzzy neural nets;signal classification;medical signal detection;feature extraction","wavelet transform;fuzzy neural network;VPC detection;ventricular premature contraction;Holter ECG;QRS detection;ECG classification algorithm;filter bank property;quadratic spline wavelet transform;feature extraction","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electrocardiography, Ambulatory;Fuzzy Logic;Humans;Neural Networks (Computer);Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Ventricular Premature Complexes","131","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previously, it was demonstrated that the MP based channel estimation outperforms the conventional least squares (LS) estimation algorithm for sparse channels. In this paper, we propose to use the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm for channel estimation. Using OMP, the convergence problem in MP algorithm based on re-selection of the basis vectors is eliminated. It is also verified that by avoiding the re-selection problem more accurate channel estimates can he obtained by using the OMP algorithm. The performance of decision feedback equalizers based on the channel estimates obtained by using the MP and OMP algorithms are compared, verifying that the OMP outperforms the MP, with a comparable computational complexity.","1090-3038","0-7803-8521-7","10.1109/VETECF.2004.1404804","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1404804","","Matching pursuit algorithms;Channel estimation;Pursuit algorithms;Signal processing algorithms;Decision feedback equalizers;Signal resolution;Fourier transforms;Least squares approximation;Discrete wavelet transforms;Discrete cosine transforms","channel estimation;iterative methods;decision feedback equalisers;signal processing","sparse channel estimation;orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm;performance;decision feedback equalizers","","40","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is found that the periphery of the photodiode (PD) is the dominant source of dark currents in our test structure, and this factor is very sensitive to the distance between the sidewall of the shallow trench isolation and the n-type region of the PD. The dark currents from the transfer gate can be effectively reduced by the tail of p/sup +/ region on the surface of the transfer gate, and those from the floating diffusion (FD) node were estimated to be negligible in the normal operational mode. However, because of the enhanced thermal generation velocity caused by the severe process-induced damages, the FD node was considered as the main source of increased dark currents in the single frame capture mode. The characteristics of quantized dark currents causing the white pixels in the CMOS APS were examined using the dark current spectroscopy method.

While low-level processing has been actively studied, high-level processing is just beginning to receive attention. This is partly because high-level processing depends on the results of low-level processing. However, high-level processing also requires some independent and additional approaches and methodologies. We focus on the following aspects of high-level processing: (1) human body modeling, (2) level of detail needed to understand human actions, (3) approaches to human action recognition, and (4) high-level recognition schemes with domain knowledge.

This paper describes a transformer design that uses the coaxial screen as primary winding and the inner conductor as secondary. An advantage of transmission line transformers is that the insulation problem is solved and the construction can be kept simple; the coupling between the primary and secondary coils is high even though the transformer uses an air core. The air core brings another advantage: the capacity to store large quantities of magnetic energy. The combination of a high coupling factor and large energy storage capacity makes this transformer ideal for charging high-voltage capacitors fast. The winding type for the transformer is alternating Archimedean spirals. Here, we present a magnetic field analysis of the transformer's primary, secondary, and mutual inductance using a finite-element solver. We compare the measured magnetic flux density versus the calculated value. The step-up winding ratio of the transformer influences the coupling factor marginally if the construction has an even number of spiral layers for each set of windings. However, the result from the finite-element solver predicts a drop in coupling factor if the step-up transformer construction has an odd number of spiral layers. The copper conductors used in the transformer resemble isotropic copper pipes.","1941-0069","","10.1109/TMAG.2004.833425","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1333133","","Nonhomogeneous media;Coaxial components;Transformer cores;Power transformer insulation;Spirals;Couplings;Transmission lines;Conductors;Magnetic cores;Magnetic field measurement","current transformers;transformer cores;transformer insulation;magnetic multilayers;transformer windings;conductors (electric);electromagnetic induction;magnetic flux;magnetisation;finite element analysis","coupling factor;multilayer coaxial transformer;high-voltage transformers;coaxial transmission lines;transformer design;coaxial screen;primary winding;inner conductor;secondary winding;transmission line transformers;insulation problem;magnetic energy;large energy storage capacity;fast high-voltage capacitors charging;alternating Archimedean spirals;magnetic field analysis;primary conductance;secondary conductance;mutual inductance;finite-element solver;magnetic flux density;step-up winding ratio;step-up transformer construction;copper conductors;isotropic copper pipes;finite-element method","","15","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore national and international R&D programs are increasing their activities on laser and high power microwave technologies in the defence and anti terror areas. The paper gives an overview of the German R&D programmes on directed energy weapons. A solid state medium energy weapon laser (MEL) is investigated at Rheinmetall for i.e. anti air defence applications up to distances of about 7 km. Due to the small volume these Lasers can be integrated as a secondary weapon system into mobile platforms such as AECVs. The beam power of a MEL is between 1 kW and 100 kW. The electric energy per pulse is in the kJ range. A burst of only a few pulses is needed to destroy optronics of targets in a distance up to 7 km. The electric energy requirements of a MEL system are low. High energy density pulsed power technologies are already available for the integration into a medium sized vehicle. The paper gives an overview on the MEL technologies which are under investigation in order to introduce a technology demonstrator at the end of 2005. The electric requirements at the interface to the power bus of a vehicle are presented. Finally an integration concept as a secondary weapon in a medium sized vehicle is given and discussed. In close cooperation with Diehl Munitionssysteme high power microwave technologies are investigated. Different kinds of HPM Sources are under development for defence and anti terror applications. It is the goal to introduce first prototype systems within a short time frame. The paper gives a brief overview on the different source technologies currently under investigation.

Then, by using high-order neural networks (HONN) as emulators of the desired controls, an effective neural network control scheme with adaptation laws is developed.

Augmented haptics, the result of applying AR to haptics, would allow a person to touch the untouchable. Our system, SmartTouch, uses a tactile display and a sensor. When the sensor contacts an object, an electrical stimulation translates the acquired information into a tactile sensation, such as a vibration or pressure, through the tactile display.

The primary disadvantage of an SRM is the vibration and acoustic noise compared with that of conventional machines. The main source of vibration in the SR drive is generated by rapid change of radial magnetic force when phase current is extinguished during commutation action. In this paper, a hybrid excitation method with C-dump inverter is proposed to reduce vibration and acoustic noise in the SR drive. The hybrid excitation has two-phase excitation by long dwell angle as well as conventional one-phase excitation.

For this setting, we introduce the class of LAttice Space-Time (LAST) codes. We show that these codes achieve the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff defined by Zheng and Tse under generalized minimum Euclidean distance lattice decoding. Our scheme is based on a generalization of Erez and Zamir mod-Lambda scheme to the MIMO case. In our construction the scalar ""scaling"" of Erez-Zamir and Costa Gaussian ""dirty-paper"" schemes is replaced by the minimum mean-square error generalized decision-feedback equalizer (MMSE-GDFE). This result settles the open problem posed by Zheng and Tse on the construction of explicit coding and decoding schemes that achieve the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff. Moreover, our results shed more light on the structure of optimal coding/decoding techniques in delay-limited MIMO channels, and hence, open the door for novel approaches for space-time code constructions. In particular, 1) we show that MMSE-GDFE plays a fundamental role in approaching the limits of delay-limited MIMO channels in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, unlike the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel case and 2) our random coding arguments represent a major departure from traditional space-time code designs based on the rank and/or mutual information design criteria.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2004.828067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1302284","","Lattices;Decoding;MIMO;AWGN;Delay;Space time codes;Signal to noise ratio;Signal design;Euclidean distance;Decision feedback equalizers","decision feedback equalisers;decoding;diversity reception;fading channels;least mean squares methods;MIMO systems;space-time codes","coherent multiple-input multiple-output channel;MIMO;flat-fading channel;receiver;lattice space-time codes;LAST codes;minimum Euclidean distance lattice decoding;mod-A scheme;minimum mean-square error;generalized decision-feedback equalizer;MMSE-GDFE;decoding schemes;diversity-multiplexing tradeoff","","220","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This inherent drawback is due to a periodical forced charging and discharging operation in the internal switched capacitors accompanied by a large capacitor current, so that their efficiency can not be increased by decreasing its internal resistance. As a result, conventional switched capacitor converters have been limited to be used with a very small output current. This paper presents some novel switched capacitor converter topologies that use a resonant operation instead of the forced charging and discharging operation. Their advantage over conventional switched capacitor converters is a high efficiency even in a high output current region.

The new algorithm solves a nonlinear integer least squares problem and, over a wide range of rates and signal-to-noise ratios, has polynomial-time complexity. Performance of the algorithm, combined with convolutional, turbo, and low-density parity check codes, is demonstrated on several multiantenna channels.

Among the current estimation techniques available for speed-sensorless induction motor drives, speed measurement based on rotor or principal slot harmonics (RSH or PSH) detection in machine line current happens to be a prominent one. In practice, two predominant RSH can be seen. The present paper attempts to investigate the effect of slot permeance on the production of RSH. Simulation studies on a small motor but with a popular stator, rotor slot, and pole combination suggest that their effect is less significant compared to rotor space harmonics effect. Also, out of the two aforementioned RSH, the cause of the less significant slot harmonic is shown to be the negative-sequence-current-induced reverse rotating field. Voltage unbalances and constructional imperfections can cause negative-sequence current even in a healthy machine. Thus, although the less significant RSH is absent in the simulated line current of an idealized machine running from a balanced supply, it can be detected in an actual machine.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2004.830764","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1315798","","Induction machines;Stators;Rotors;Velocity measurement;Spine;Variable speed drives;Voltage;Geometry;Frequency;Industry Applications Society","induction motor drives;velocity measurement;stators;rotors","induction motor drives;induction machine;stator;rotor slot harmonics;adjustable-speed drives;principal slot harmonics;speed measurement;current estimation","","74","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In parallel with these studies, extensive developmental investigations of extremely broadband antennas have been carried out in Japan, based on this principle. This article succinctly describes a long history of these studies on self-complementary antennas, including the background of its origination. In connection with the extremely broadband property of this type of antenna, the non-constant-impedance property of incorrectly arranged log-periodic antennas is clearly shown, based on the results of experiments.

In CLIDAR, the detection and ranging are realized by correlating the signal waveform reflected back from the target with a delayed reference waveform. Benefiting from the very broad bandwidth of the chaotic waveform that can be easily generated by a semiconductor laser, a centimeter-range resolution is readily achieved. The correlation performance of CLIDAR is studied both numerically and experimentally. The power spectra, phase portraits, time series, and correlation traces of the chaotic waveforms obtained at different operating conditions are compared. The relation between the complexity of the attractor and the correlation property is examined. The correlation dimension and the largest positive Lyapunov exponent of each waveform are calculated. To compare the correlation performance of the waveforms quantitatively, peak sidelobe levels of the correlation traces with different correlation lengths and relative noise levels are investigated.

IV 2004.","","2004","","","519","524","This work focuses on an aspect which has been neglected, but which is decisive: the transfer of knowledge to different stakeholders; especially the transfer of insights derived from information visualization tools. In knowledge management, the transfer of knowledge is a core process, which can be improved by using our innate abilities to process visual representations. The potential of visualizations are manifold. But business managers miss a holistic framework on the use of visualization methods for information exploration and communication tasks. This paper analyzes how architects use visualizations to amplify cognition and to transfer knowledge. It introduces a mediating framework that brings together isolated research directions and defines the new research focus knowledge visualization. Knowledge visualization examines the use of visualizations for the transfer of knowledge between at least two people.

The paper interprets the components of the algorithm that affect the voltage magnitude and frequency into block diagrams that can be linearized and studied using continuous time approximations. This paper uses a frequency domain approach to analyze the range for the gains required by anti-islanding algorithm to effectively determine the disconnection of the mains grid within an acceptable time duration.

No.04TH8720)","","2004","5","","3306","3312 Vol.5","This paper presents the current concept using extensible markup language (XML) as the underlying structure for the James Webb space telescope (JWST) database. The purpose of using XML is to provide a JWST database, independent of any portion of the ground system, yet still compatible with the various systems using a variety of different structures. The testing of the JWST flight software (FSW) started in 2002, yet the launch is scheduled for 2011 with a planned 5-year mission and a 5-year follow on option. The initial database and ground system elements, including the commands, telemetry, and ground system tools will be used for 19 years, plus post mission activities. During the integration and test (I&T) phases of the JWST development, 24 distinct laboratories, each geographically dispersed, have local database tools with an XML database. Each of these laboratories database tools are used for the exporting and importing of data both locally and to a central database system, inputting data to the database certification process, and providing various reports. A centralized certified database repository is maintained by the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. One of the challenges for the database is to be flexible enough to allow for the upgrade, addition or changing of individual items without effecting the entire ground system. Also, using XML should allow for the altering of the import and export formats needed by the various elements, tracking the verification/validation of each database item, allow many organizations to provide database inputs, and the merging of the many existing database processes into one central database structure throughout the JWST program. Many National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) projects have attempted to take advantage of open source and commercial technology. Often this causes a greater reliance on the use of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), which often limits the customization needed in spacecraft ground systems. In our review of the database requirements and the COTS software available, only very expensive COTS software meet 90% of requirements. Even with the high projected initial cost of COTS, the development and support for custom code over the 19-year mission period was forecasted to be higher than the total licensing costs. A group did look at reusing existing database tools and formats. If the JWST database was already in a mature state, the reuse made sense, but with the database still needing to handing the addition of different types of command and telemetry structures, defining new spacecraft systems, accept input and export to systems which has not been defined yet, XML provided the flexibility desired. It remains to be determined whether the XML database reduces the over all cost for the JWST mission.","1095-323X","0-7803-8155-6","10.1109/AERO.2004.1368137","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1368137","","XML;Telescopes;Databases;Costs;Telemetry;Laboratories;Space vehicles;Open source software;Software testing;Scheduling","radiotelescopes;XML;database languages;ground support systems;distributed databases;program testing;software packages;software reusability","","","5","","4","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed converter and its control is designed to be compatible to a fuel cell power source, which exhibits 2:1 voltage variation as well as a slow transient response. The proposed approach consists of two stages: a conventional boost converter stage cascaded with a current-fed two-inductor boost converter topology, which has a higher voltage gain and isolation from the input source. The function of the first boost converter stage is to maintain a constant voltage at the input of the cascaded DC-DC converter to ensure optimal performance characteristics with high efficiency. At the output of the first boost converter a battery or ultracapacitor energy storage is connected to take care of the fuel cell slow transient response (200 watts/min). The robust features of the proposed control system ensure a constant output DC voltage for a variety of load fluctuations, thus limiting the power being delivered by the fuel cell during a load transient. Moreover, the proposed configuration simplifies the power control management and can interact with the fuel cell controller.

This paper focuses on system design issues for three-dimensional packaging technology and discusses interconnection density, material compatibility, thermal management, electrical requirements, related to delay and noise. Microelectronics packaging has to provide all future devices, such as electronics, actuators, sensors, antennas, optical/photonic, MEMS, and biological solutions. However, a 3D package is a cost effective solution to save placement and routing area on board using several IC processes in the same module. System-in-package (SiP) can combine all the electronic requirements of a functional system or a subsystem in one package. The driving force is integration without compromising individual chip technologies. In this work, a stacked system-in-package structure has been studied. The thermo-mechanical behavior of packages has been analyzed by finite element analysis (FEA) and the correlation between the experimental test results and the modeling was analyzed. A stacked 3D package can contain multiple heat sources that produce high power density. Therefore, thermal management needs extra attention to ensure safe operating temperatures under all conditions. The thermal behavior of the package was modeled using FEA and a boundary condition independent (BCI) compact thermal model (CTM) was built based on simulation results. In addition, high-speed signal and interfering environment set quite stringent requirements for 3D devices. Crosstalk between vertical connections was simulated and measured. Measurements of S-parameters were done using a network analyzer.

In this paper, we focus on planar fully actuated robots. We require that the manifold A has a product structure A=G/spl times/S, where G is a Lie group, which captures the position and orientation of the ensemble in the chosen world coordinate frame, and S is a shape manifold, which is an intrinsic characterization of the team describing the ""shape"" as the area spanned by the robots. We design decoupled controllers for the group and shape variables. We derive controllers for individual robots that guarantee the desired behavior on A. These controllers can be realized by feedback that depends only on the current state of the robot and the state of the manifold A. This has the practical advantage of reducing the communication and sensing that is required and limiting the complexity of individual robot controllers, even for large numbers of robots.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2004.829498","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1339386","","Robot kinematics;Orbital robotics;Communication system control;Shape control;Robot sensing systems;Robot control;Automatic control;Control systems;Robotics and automation;Motion control","multi-robot systems;Lie groups;feedback;position control;motion control","robots abstraction;robots control;decoupled controllers;manifold state;Lie group;cooperative robots","","231","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, good touch sense of remote object has not been realized in actual system yet. In this paper, the goals of bilateral teleoperation are considered as following two points. One is a reproduction of environmental impedance in master side. The other is a realization of small operational force. Operational force means the force the operator feels in addition to real environmental force. Corresponding to these goals, novel evaluation indices are defined which are named ""reproducibility"" and ""operationality"", respectively. Moreover, control stability must be satisfied. After all, bilateral teleoperation must satisfy three conditions such as reproducibility, operationality and stability. Using defined evaluation indices, bilateral controller is designed. Through analysis, it is confirmed that the three desired conditions in bilateral teleoperation are well satisfied with this controller. The effectiveness of this research is demonstrated by an experiment with bilateral forceps robot.","","0-7803-8300-1","10.1109/AMC.2004.1297669","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1297669","","Reproducibility of results;Impedance;Stability;Haptic interfaces;Master-slave;Control systems;Design engineering;Systems engineering and theory;Robot sensing systems;Space technology","telerobotics;stability;control system synthesis;mechanical variables control","reproducibility;operationality;bilateral teleoperation;remote object;environmental impedance;operational force;control stability;bilateral controller;bilateral forceps robot;control system synthesis","","279","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The performance of these cells is characterized by the sampling accuracy and voltage droop that can be achieved with a given level of die area and power. Hand calculations suggest past implementations have not achieved minimum voltage droop due to uncompensated MOS leakage mechanisms. In this paper, the dominant sources of MOS leakage are experimentally characterized in a standard 1.5-/spl mu/m CMOS process using an on-chip current integration technique, focusing specifically on the 1 fA to 1 aA current range. These measurements reveal an accumulation-mode source-drain coupling mechanism that can easily dominate diode leakage under certain bias conditions and may have limited previous designs. A simple rule-of-thumb is offered for avoiding this leakage effect, leading to a novel ultra-low leakage switch topology. A differential storage cell incorporating this new switch achieves an average leakage of 10 aA at room temperature, an 8/spl times/ reduction over past designs. The cell loses one bit of voltage accuracy, 700 /spl mu/V on a 12-bit scale and 11.3 mV on an 8-bit scale, in 3.3 and 54 min, respectively. This represents a 15/spl times/ increase in hold time at these voltage accuracies over the lowest leakage cell to date, in only 92% of the area. Since the leakage is independent of amplifier bias, the cell can operate on as little as 10 nW of power. Initial measurements also indicate the switch's leakage decreases with the square of process feature size.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2004.835817","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1347329","","Voltage;Switches;Circuits;Sampling methods;CMOS process;Diodes;Topology;Temperature;Power amplifiers;Size measurement","analogue storage;CMOS analogue integrated circuits;leakage currents;CMOS memory circuits;low-power electronics","analog storage cell;temporary local memory;sampling accuracy;voltage droop;MOS leakage mechanisms;CMOS process;on-chip current integration technique;accumulation-mode source-drain coupling mechanism;diode leakage;bias conditions;ultra-low leakage switch topology;differential storage cell;analog memory;junction leakage;sample-and-hold;weak inversion;10 nW;12 bit;1.5 micron;700 muV;11.3 mV;3.3 min;54 min","","51","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, a new low-voltage folded-switching mixer with current-reuse, which operates at 1 V supply voltage, is discussed. The main advantages of the introduced mixer topology are: a high voltage gain, a low noise figure, an operation at low supply voltages and flexibility in terms of mixer redesign for operation at different supply voltages. In order to alleviate the mixer design for different set of specifications and to provide a designer with a mixer design procedure, insight into mixer operation is given analyzing gain, noise figure and linearity. The mixer is designed in 0.18 /spl mu/m CMOS technology. Taking into account the obtained simulation results at a supply voltage of 1 V (gain = 9 dB, NF = 12 dB, IIP3 = -1 dBm) and with a power consumption of 2.8 mW, the presented folded-switching mixer with current-reuse outperforms many of, so far, published CMOS mixers.","","0-7803-8251-X","10.1109/ISCAS.2004.1328258","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1328258","","CMOS technology;Radio frequency;Low voltage;Analog circuits;CMOS digital integrated circuits;CMOS analog integrated circuits;Circuit topology;Noise measurement;Noise figure;Linearity","mixers (circuits);switching circuits;CMOS analogue integrated circuits;integrated circuit design;low-power electronics","folded-switching mixer;current-reuse;CMOS technology scaling;analog design;voltage supply;mixer topology;high voltage gain;low noise figure;low supply voltage;mixer operation;CMOS mixer;0.18 micron;1 V;9 dB;12 dB;2.8 mW","","9","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Rechtschaffen and Kales (R-K) method is a standard to estimate sleep stage. However, it involves restraining the examinee and, thus, induces psychological stress. Furthermore, it requires specialists with a high degree of technical expertise and the use of an expensive polygraph. The sleep estimation method presented here is based on the noninvasive and unrestrained pneumatic biomeasurement method presented by the authors. Sleep stage transition in overnight sleep and the relationship between sleep stage and biosignals measured using the pneumatic method was analyzed and from the results, a mathematical model of sleep was created. Based on this model, a sleep stage estimator, including a sleep stage classifier and observer, was designed. The sleep state transition equation was the basis for the design of this observer, while the observed relationships were the basis for designing a classifier. Agreement of the estimated sleep stages with those obtained using the R-K method for the non-REM stage was 82.6%, for the REM stage was 38.3% and for Wake was 70.5%, including disagreement. However, the new method might ultimately result in better estimation of sleep stage due to the fact that it does not physically restrain the patient and does not induce psychological stress.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2004.828037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337142","","Sleep;Biomedical measurements;Human factors;Psychology;Electrostatic measurements;Observers;Heart beat;Control engineering;Heart rate;Current measurement","sleep;cardiology;pneumodynamics;medical signal processing;medical signal detection;physiological models;biomedical measurement","noncontact method;sleep stage estimation;Rechtschaffen-Kales method;psychological stress;noninvasive unrestrained pneumatic biomeasurement method;biosignals;mathematical sleep model;sleep stage classifier;sleep stage observer;sleep state transition equation;REM stage;nonREM stage;wake stage","Adult;Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Heart Rate;Humans;Movement;Physical Examination;Polysomnography;Reproducibility of Results;Respiratory Mechanics;Sensitivity and Specificity;Sleep Stages","97","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These prices are, in fact, dependent on a number of factors such as the generating unit bid, system load level, network topology and security limits imposed on the transmission network due to thermal, and voltage and stability considerations. Computing these energy prices at all buses in large transmission networks under given system operating conditions can be time-consuming. This paper describes a simple methodology based on the analysis performed by the Hydro One in-house computer program (PROCOSE) to calculate, for a given period of time, transmission congestion cost (TCC) in dollars per unit time and locational marginal pricing (LMP) in dollars per megawatt-hour (MWh) at any selected bus in the transmission system. In addition, the information provided by the program output on congested transmission elements is used to identify buses in the network whose LMPs are representative of the entire network. The computed LMPs at these buses are used to define zones in the network where each zone has its LMP. The proposed methodology can be used to carry out sensitivity studies to determine the impact of changes in system parameters and operating conditions on the LMPs. The proposed method is illustrated using the IEEE Reliability Test System (RTS) and the Hydro One network system.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2004.825823","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1294980","","Costs;Pricing;Electricity supply industry;Computer networks;Network topology;Thermal factors;Thermal loading;Voltage;Thermal stability;Performance analysis","power markets;pricing;power transmission economics;power engineering computing","transmission congestion cost;locational marginal pricing;electricity market;open access environment;energy prices;generating unit bid;system load level;network topology;transmission network security;hydro one in-house computer program;reliability test systems","","40","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
