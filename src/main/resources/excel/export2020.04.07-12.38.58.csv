"Performance analysis of the IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function","G. Bianchi","Dipt. di Ingegneria Elettrica, Palermo Univ., Italy","IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","","2000","18","3","535","547","The IEEE has standardized the 802.11 protocol for wireless local area networks. The primary medium access control (MAC) technique of 802.11 is called the distributed coordination function (DCF). The DCF is a carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) scheme with binary slotted exponential backoff. This paper provides a simple, but nevertheless extremely accurate, analytical model to compute the 802.11 DCF throughput, in the assumption of finite number of terminals and ideal channel conditions. The proposed analysis applies to both the packet transmission schemes employed by DCF, namely, the basic access and the RTS/CTS access mechanisms. In addition, it also applies to a combination of the two schemes, in which packets longer than a given threshold are transmitted according to the RTS/CTS mechanism. By means of the proposed model, we provide an extensive throughput performance evaluation of both access mechanisms of the 802.11 protocol.","1558-0008","","10.1109/49.840210","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=840210","","Performance analysis;Access protocols;Media Access Protocol;Collision avoidance;Multiaccess communication;Analytical models;Wireless LAN;Throughput;Physical layer;Wireless application protocol","IEEE standards;carrier sense multiple access;telecommunication standards;standardisation;wireless LAN;packet radio networks","performance analysis;IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function;standardization;IEEE 802.11 protocol;wireless local area networks;medium access control;MAC;DCF;carrier sense multiple access;collision avoidance;CSMA/CA;binary slotted exponential backoff;analytical model;terminals;ideal channel conditions;packet transmission;threshold;throughput performance evaluation","","5594","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Among the various frameworks in which pattern recognition has been traditionally formulated, the statistical approach has been most intensively studied and used in practice. More recently, neural network techniques and methods imported from statistical learning theory have been receiving increasing attention. The design of a recognition system requires careful attention to the following issues: definition of pattern classes, sensing environment, pattern representation, feature extraction and selection, cluster analysis, classifier design and learning, selection of training and test samples, and performance evaluation. In spite of almost 50 years of research and development in this field, the general problem of recognizing complex patterns with arbitrary orientation, location, and scale remains unsolved. New and emerging applications, such as data mining, web searching, retrieval of multimedia data, face recognition, and cursive handwriting recognition, require robust and efficient pattern recognition techniques. The objective of this review paper is to summarize and compare some of the well-known methods used in various stages of a pattern recognition system and identify research topics and applications which are at the forefront of this exciting and challenging field.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.824819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=824819","","Pattern recognition;Neural networks;Statistical learning;Feature extraction;Pattern analysis;Performance analysis;System testing;Research and development;Data mining;Information retrieval","pattern recognition;neural nets;Bayes methods;decision theory;learning (artificial intelligence);parameter estimation","statistical pattern recognition;unsupervised classification;supervised classification;neural network techniques;statistical learning theory;pattern classes;sensing environment;pattern representation;cluster analysis;classifier design;performance evaluation;complex patterns;data mining;web searching;multimedia data retrieval;cursive handwriting recognition","","3537","","176","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed procedure consists of a closed-form solution, followed by a nonlinear refinement based on the maximum likelihood criterion. Both computer simulation and real data have been used to test the proposed technique and very good results have been obtained.

"Energy-efficient communication protocol for wireless microsensor networks","W. R. Heinzelman; A. Chandrakasan; H.

In this paper, we look at communication protocols, which can have significant impact on the overall energy dissipation of these networks. Based on our findings that the conventional protocols of direct transmission, minimum-transmission-energy, multi-hop routing, and static clustering may not be optimal for sensor networks, we propose LEACH (Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy), a clustering-based protocol that utilizes randomized rotation of local cluster based station (cluster-heads) to evenly distribute the energy load among the sensors in the network. LEACH uses localized coordination to enable scalability and robustness for dynamic networks, and incorporates data fusion into the routing protocol to reduce the amount of information that must be transmitted to the base station. Simulations show the LEACH can achieve as much as a factor of 8 reduction in energy dissipation compared with conventional outing protocols. In addition, LEACH is able to distribute energy dissipation evenly throughout the sensors, doubling the useful system lifetime for the networks we simulated.","","0-7695-0493-0","10.1109/HICSS.2000.926982","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=926982","","Energy efficiency;Wireless application protocol;Wireless communication;Microsensors;Energy dissipation;Routing protocols;Telecommunication network reliability;Monitoring;Spread spectrum communication;Scalability","protocols;sensor fusion;military communication;microsensors;mobile radio;telecommunication network routing","energy-efficient communication protocol;wireless distributed microsensor system;reliable monitoring;civil applications;military applications;energy dissipation;LEACH;Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy;clustering-based protocol;randomized local cluster based station rotation;energy load distribution;localized coordination;scalability;robustness;dynamic networks;data fusion;routing protocol;simulations;useful system lifetime","","4780","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"The unscented Kalman filter for nonlinear estimation","E. A. Wan; R. Van Der Merwe","Oregon Graduate Inst. of Sci. & Technol., Beaverton, OR, USA; NA","Proceedings of the IEEE 2000 Adaptive Systems for Signal Processing, Communications, and Control Symposium (Cat. No.00EX373)","","2000","","","153","158","This paper points out the flaws in using the extended Kalman filter (EKE) and introduces an improvement, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF), proposed by Julier and Uhlman (1997). A central and vital operation performed in the Kalman filter is the propagation of a Gaussian random variable (GRV) through the system dynamics. In the EKF the state distribution is approximated by a GRV, which is then propagated analytically through the first-order linearization of the nonlinear system. This can introduce large errors in the true posterior mean and covariance of the transformed GRV, which may lead to sub-optimal performance and sometimes divergence of the filter. The UKF addresses this problem by using a deterministic sampling approach. The state distribution is again approximated by a GRV, but is now represented using a minimal set of carefully chosen sample points. These sample points completely capture the true mean and covariance of the GRV, and when propagated through the true nonlinear system, captures the posterior mean and covariance accurately to the 3rd order (Taylor series expansion) for any nonlinearity. The EKF in contrast, only achieves first-order accuracy. Remarkably, the computational complexity of the UKF is the same order as that of the EKF. Julier and Uhlman demonstrated the substantial performance gains of the UKF in the context of state-estimation for nonlinear control. Machine learning problems were not considered. We extend the use of the UKF to a broader class of nonlinear estimation problems, including nonlinear system identification, training of neural networks, and dual estimation problems. In this paper, the algorithms are further developed and illustrated with a number of additional examples.","","0-7803-5800-7","10.1109/ASSPCC.2000.882463","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=882463","","Nonlinear systems;Random variables;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Filters;Sampling methods;Taylor series;Computational complexity;Performance gain;Machine learning;Neural networks","adaptive Kalman filters;parameter estimation;filtering theory;nonlinear systems;state estimation;nonlinear estimation;learning (artificial intelligence);covariance analysis;computational complexity","unscented Kalman filter;nonlinear estimation;extended Kalman filter;Gaussian random variable;system dynamics;state distribution;nonlinear system;covariance;deterministic sampling approach;sample points;posterior mean;computational complexity;state-estimation;nonlinear control;machine learning;nonlinear system identification;neural networks training;dual estimation problems","","1190","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"The capacity of wireless networks","P. Gupta; P. R. Kumar","Coordinated Sci. Lab., Illinois Univ., Urbana, IL, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","","2000","46","2","388","404","When n identical randomly located nodes, each capable of transmitting at W bits per second and using a fixed range, form a wireless network, the throughput /spl lambda/(n) obtainable by each node for a randomly chosen destination is /spl Theta/(W//spl radic/(nlogn)) bits per second under a noninterference protocol. If the nodes are optimally placed in a disk of unit area, traffic patterns are optimally assigned, and each transmission's range is optimally chosen, the bit-distance product that can be transported by the network per second is /spl Theta/(W/spl radic/An) bit-meters per second. Thus even under optimal circumstances, the throughput is only /spl Theta/(W//spl radic/n) bits per second for each node for a destination nonvanishingly far away. Similar results also hold under an alternate physical model where a required signal-to-interference ratio is specified for successful receptions. Fundamentally, it is the need for every node all over the domain to share whatever portion of the channel it is utilizing with nodes in its local neighborhood that is the reason for the constriction in capacity. Splitting the channel into several subchannels does not change any of the results. Some implications may be worth considering by designers. Since the throughput furnished to each user diminishes to zero as the number of users is increased, perhaps networks connecting smaller numbers of users, or featuring connections mostly with nearby neighbors, may be more likely to be find acceptance.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.825799","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=825799","","Information rates","channel capacity;protocols;telecommunication traffic;packet radio networks;telecommunication network routing","wireless network capacity;identical randomly located nodes;throughput;noninterference protocol;unit area disk;traffic patterns;transmission range;bit-distance product;physical model;signal-to-interference ratio;successful receptions;data packets routing;arbitrary networks;random networks","","5484","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This model subsumes all previously studied models along the same line. We study the problem with one information source, and we have obtained a simple characterization of the admissible coding rate region. Our result can be regarded as the max-flow min-cut theorem for network information flow. Contrary to one's intuition, our work reveals that it is in general not optimal to regard the information to be multicast as a ""fluid"" which can simply be routed or replicated. Rather, by employing coding at the nodes, which we refer to as network coding, bandwidth can in general be saved.

Part of the difficulty is that device noise undergoes multiple frequency translations to become oscillator phase noise. A quantitative understanding of this process requires abandoning the principle of time invariance assumed in most older theories of phase noise. Fortunately, the noise-to-phase transfer function of oscillators is still linear, despite the existence of the nonlinearities necessary for amplitude stabilization. In addition to providing a quantitative reconciliation between theory and measurement, the time-varying phase noise model presented in this tutorial identifies the importance of symmetry in suppressing the upconversion of 1/f noise into close-in phase noise, and provides an explicit appreciation of cyclostationary effects and AM-PM conversion. These insights allow a reinterpretation of why the Colpitts oscillator exhibits good performance, and suggest new oscillator topologies. Tuned LC and ring oscillator circuit examples are presented to reinforce the theoretical considerations developed.

For extended sites, the system will require multiple cameras. Thus, key elements of the system are motion tracking, camera coordination, activity classification, and event detection. In this paper, we focus on motion tracking and show how one can use observed motion to learn patterns of activity in a site. Motion segmentation is based on an adaptive background subtraction method that models each pixel as a mixture of Gaussians and uses an online approximation to update the model. The Gaussian distributions are then evaluated to determine which are most likely to result from a background process. This yields a stable, real-time outdoor tracker that reliably deals with lighting changes, repetitive motions from clutter, and long-term scene changes. While a tracking system is unaware of the identity of any object it tracks, the identity remains the same for the entire tracking sequence. Our system leverages this information by accumulating joint co-occurrences of the representations within a sequence. These joint co-occurrence statistics are then used to create a hierarchical binary-tree classification of the representations. This method is useful for classifying sequences, as well as individual instances of activities in a site.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.868677","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=868677","","Tracking;Cameras;Monitoring;Event detection;Motion segmentation;Computer vision;Gaussian approximation;Gaussian distribution;Layout;Statistics","tracking;computer vision;real-time systems;learning (artificial intelligence);computerised monitoring;sensor fusion;pattern classification;Gaussian distribution","activity pattern learning;real-time tracking;visual monitoring system;passive observation;multiple cameras;motion tracking;camera coordination;activity classification;event detection;motion segmentation;adaptive background subtraction method;online approximation;stable real-time outdoor tracker;lighting changes;repetitive motions;clutter;long-term scene changes;joint co-occurrence statistics;hierarchical binary-tree classification","","2211","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose that automation can be applied to four broad classes of functions: 1) information acquisition; 2) information analysis; 3) decision and action selection; and 4) action implementation. Within each of these types, automation can be applied across a continuum of levels from low to high, i.e., from fully manual to fully automatic. A particular system can involve automation of all four types at different levels. The human performance consequences of particular types and levels of automation constitute primary evaluative criteria for automation design using our model.

The process allows for the stacking of many thin (less than 100-/spl mu/m thick) patterned PDMS layers to realize complex 3-D channel paths. The master for each layer is formed on a silicon wafer using an epoxy-based photoresist (SU 8). PDMS is cast against the master producing molded layers containing channels and openings. To realize thin layers with openings, a sandwich molding configuration was developed that allows precise control of the PDMS thickness. The master wafer is clamped within a sandwich that includes flat aluminum plates, a flexible polyester film layer, a rigid Pyrex wafer, and a rubber sheet. A parametric study is performed on PDMS surface activation in a reactive-ion-etching system and the subsequent methanol treatment for bonding and aligning very thin individual components to a substrate.

In this paper, we develop a solid foundation for phase noise that is valid for any oscillator, regardless of operating mechanism. We establish novel results about the dynamics of stable nonlinear oscillators in the presence of perturbations, both deterministic and random. We obtain an exact nonlinear equation for phase error, which we solve without approximations for random perturbations. This leads us to a precise characterization of timing jitter and spectral dispersion, for computing of which we have developed efficient numerical methods. We demonstrate our techniques on a variety of practical electrical oscillators and obtain good matches with measurements, even at frequencies close to the carrier, where previous techniques break down. Our methods are more than three orders of magnitude faster than the brute-force Monte Carlo approach, which is the only previously available technique that can predict phase noise correctly.","1558-1268","","10.1109/81.847872","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=847872","","Phase noise;Oscillators;Electronic circuits;Nonlinear optics;Optical noise;Solids;Nonlinear equations;Timing jitter;Frequency measurement;Electric variables measurement","oscillators;phase noise;numerical analysis;circuit noise;timing jitter;differential equations;nonlinear network analysis","stable nonlinear oscillators;oscillator phase noise;unifying theory;numerical methods;oscillator dynamics;deterministic perturbations;random perturbations;nonlinear equation;phase error;timing jitter;spectral dispersion;electrical oscillators","","764","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Adaptive wavelet thresholding for image denoising and compression","S. G. Chang; Bin Yu; M. Vetterli","Dept. of Electr. Eng. & Comput.

The threshold is derived in a Bayesian framework, and the prior used on the wavelet coefficients is the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) widely used in image processing applications. The proposed threshold is simple and closed-form, and it is adaptive to each subband because it depends on data-driven estimates of the parameters. Experimental results show that the proposed method, called BayesShrink, is typically within 5% of the MSE of the best soft-thresholding benchmark with the image assumed known. It also outperforms SureShrink (Donoho and Johnstone 1994, 1995; Donoho 1995) most of the time. The second part of the paper attempts to further validate claims that lossy compression can be used for denoising. The BayesShrink threshold can aid in the parameter selection of a coder designed with the intention of denoising, and thus achieving simultaneous denoising and compression. Specifically, the zero-zone in the quantization step of compression is analogous to the threshold value in the thresholding function. The remaining coder design parameters are chosen based on a criterion derived from Rissanen's minimum description length (MDL) principle. Experiments show that this compression method does indeed remove noise significantly, especially for large noise power. However, it introduces quantization noise and should be used only if bitrate were an additional concern to denoising.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.862633","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=862633","","Image denoising;Image coding;Noise reduction;Quantization;Bayesian methods;Wavelet coefficients;Gaussian distribution;Image processing;Parameter estimation;Bit rate","Image restoration;Gaussian distribution;Image coding;Data compression;Adaptive signal processing;Wavelet transforms;Bayes methods","adaptive wavelet thresholding;image denoising;compression;adaptive data-driven threshold;wavelet soft-thresholding;Bayesian framework;wavelet coefficients;generalized Gaussian distribution;BayesShrink;lossy compression;parameter selection;zero-zone;quantization step;Rissanen minimum description length principle;MDL principle;quantization noise","","1529","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Achieving bidirectional flow of power using the same power components provides a simple, efficient and galvanically isolated topology that is specially attractive for use in battery charge/discharge circuits in DC UPS. The DC mains (provided by the AC mains), when presented, powers the down stream load converters and the bidirectional converter which essentially operates in the buck mode to charge the battery to a nominal value of 48 V. On failure of the DC mains (derived from the AC mains), the converter operation is comparable to that of a boost and the battery regulates the bus voltage and thereby provides power to the downstream converters. Small signal and steady state analyses are presented for this specific application. The design of a laboratory prototype is included. Experimental results from the prototype, under different operating conditions, validate and evaluate the proposed topology.

The problem of localization, that is, determining where a given node is physically located in a network, is a challenging one, and yet extremely crucial for many of these applications. Practical considerations such as the small size, form factor, cost and power constraints of nodes preclude the reliance on GPS of all nodes in these networks. We review localization techniques and evaluate the effectiveness of a very simple connectivity metric method for localization in outdoor environments that makes use of the inherent RF communications capabilities of these devices. A fixed number of reference points in the network with overlapping regions of coverage transmit periodic beacon signals. Nodes use a simple connectivity metric, which is more robust to environmental vagaries, to infer proximity to a given subset of these reference points. Nodes localize themselves to the centroid of their proximate reference points. The accuracy of localization is then dependent on the separation distance between two-adjacent reference points and the transmission range of these reference points. Initial experimental results show that the accuracy for 90 percent of our data points is within one-third of the separation distance. However, future work is needed to extend the technique to more cluttered environments.","1558-0652","","10.1109/98.878533","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=878533","","Global Positioning System;Timing;Time measurement;Wireless sensor networks;Mobile robots;Receivers;Instruments;Monitoring;Soil;Costs","radio networks;microsensors;geophysical techniques;geophysical equipment;radio direction-finding","GPS-less low-cost outdoor localization;very small devices;wireless sensor nodes;environmental monitoring;water monitoring;soil monitoring;form factor;cost;power constraints;localization techniques;connectivity metric method;RF communications;periodic beacon signals transmission;network nodes;separation distance;transmission range;experimental results;wireless networks;microsensors","","2074","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Pioneering studies showed that if the fades connecting pairs of transmit and receive antenna elements are independently, identically distributed, MEAs offer a large increase in capacity compared to single-antenna systems. An MEA system can be described in terms of spatial eigenmodes, which are single-input single-output subchannels. The channel capacity of an MEA is the sum of capacities of these subchannels. We show that the fading correlation affects the MEA capacity by modifying the distributions of the gains of these subchannels. The fading correlation depends on the physical parameters of MEA and the scatterer characteristics.

For only with this insight is it possible to optimize oscillator circuits using low-quality integrated resonators to comply with the exacting phase noise specifications of modern wireless systems. In this paper we concentrate on an understanding of the popular differential LC oscillator. We introduce simple models to capture the nonlinear processes that convert voltage or current thermal noise in resistors or transistors into phase noise in the oscillator. The analysis does not require hypothetical elements, such as limiters or amplitude control loops, to fully explain phase noise. A simple expression at the end accurately specifies thermally induced phase noise, and lends substance to Leeson's original hypothesis. Next, the upconversion of flicker noise into phase noise is traced to mechanisms first identified in the 1930's, but apparently since forgotten. Unlike thermally induced phase noise, which appears as phase modulation sidebands, flicker noise is shown to upconvert by bias-dependent frequency modulation. The results are validated against SpectreRF simulations and measurements on two differential CMOS oscillators tuned by resonators with very different Q's.","","0-7803-5809-0","10.1109/CICC.2000.852732","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=852732","","Phase noise;Oscillators;1f noise;Circuits;Steady-state;Phase modulation;Frequency modulation;Voltage;Noise level;Additive noise","Oscillators;Phase noise;Flicker noise;Thermal noise;CMOS analog integrated circuits;Integrated circuit noise;Circuit noise","physical processes;phase noise;differential LC oscillators;low-quality integrated resonators;noise specifications;wireless systems;models;nonlinear processes;voltage thermal noise;current thermal noise;flicker noise;noise upconversion;phase modulation sidebands;bias-dependent frequency modulation;SpectreRF simulations;differential CMOS oscillators","","286","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this kind of battery, a general model structure is defined from which specific models can be inferred, having different degrees of complexity and simulation quality.

There is, however, little consensus in the research community on what is an ADL, what aspects of an architecture should be modeled in an ADL, and which of several possible ADLs is best suited for a particular problem. Furthermore, the distinction is rarely made between ADLs on one hand and formal specification, module interconnection, simulation and programming languages on the other. This paper attempts to provide an answer to these questions. It motivates and presents a definition and a classification framework for ADLs. The utility of the definition is demonstrated by using it to differentiate ADLs from other modeling notations. The framework is used to classify and compare several existing ADLs, enabling us, in the process, to identify key properties of ADLs.

Increasing the capacitance with a current-mode multiplier allows the circuit to occupy less silicon area and to more effectively drive capacitive loads. Reducing physical area requirements while producing the same or perhaps better performance is especially useful in complex systems where most, if not all, functions are integrated onto a single integrated circuit. Die area in such systems is a luxury. The increasing demand for mobile battery-operated devices is a driving force toward higher integration. The enhanced Miller-compensation technique developed in this paper helps enable higher integration while being readily applicable to any process technology, be it CMOS, bipolar, or BiCMOS. Furthermore, the technique applies, in general, to amplifier circuits in feedback configuration. Experimentally, the integrated linear regulator (fabricated in a 1-/spl mu/m BiCMOS process technology) proved to be stable for a wide variety of loading conditions: load currents of up to 200 mA, equivalent series resistance of up to 3 /spl Omega/, and load capacitors ranging from 1.5 nF to 20 /spl mu/E The total quiescent current flowing through the regulator was less than 30 /spl mu/A during zero load-current conditions.","1558-173X","","10.1109/4.818917","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=818917","","Capacitors;Frequency;Regulators;Integrated circuit technology;Impedance;Resistors;Silicon;CMOS technology;BiCMOS integrated circuits;Transconductors","active networks;analogue multipliers;compensation;circuit feedback;BiCMOS analogue integrated circuits;voltage regulators","active capacitor multiplier;Miller-compensated circuits;internally compensated linear regulator;current-mode multiplier;capacitive loads;physical area requirements;mobile battery-operated devices;feedback configuration;BiCMOS process technology;loading conditions;load currents;equivalent series resistance;load capacitors;quiescent current;zero load-current conditions;1 micron;1.5 nF to 20 muF","","168","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a modification to the standard five element BVD model, in which a second resistor is added in series with the plate capacitance C/sub 0/. This improves the model predictions as compared to the data obtained from a network analyzer (NWA). Here, the modified model will be developed in terms of the resonant frequencies, effective coupling constant k/sub t//sup 2/, and the quality factor Q, as determined from the S parameters of an FBAR measured by the NWA. To evaluate the FBAR resonators on a routine basis, an automated data acquisition and parameter extraction method based on the Modified Butterworth-Van Dyke model (MBVD) is described. An Agilent Technologies 8753ES NWA operating under Personal Computer control is used to acquire and process FBAR data by means of a custom HPVEE/sup TM/ program, which transfers data from the NWA, and extracts the six MBVD circuit parameters. Excellent agreement is obtained between the measured data for a typical FBAR resonator and calculated ""postdictions"" obtained from the MBVD circuit. Coupled with the automated method, which takes about 10 seconds per resonator to perform a complete extraction cycle, a computer controlled probing station is used to acquire data from several hundred resonators on the wafer upon which the FBARS were fabricated. With this speed and probing capability, it is feasible to wafer map the FBARs for uniformity. Contour plots of the measured resonant frequency and coupling constant k/sub t//sup 2/ will be presented to illustrate the capability.","1051-0117","0-7803-6365-5","10.1109/ULTSYM.2000.922679","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=922679","","Levee;Film bulk acoustic resonators;Parameter extraction;Resonant frequency;Frequency measurement;Automatic control;Data mining;Distributed parameter circuits;Resistors;Capacitance","acoustic resonators;bulk acoustic wave devices;acoustic microwave devices;automatic testing;Q-factor;S-parameters;data acquisition;computerised instrumentation","modified Butterworth-Van Dyke circuit;FBAR resonators;automated measurement system;microwave film bulk acoustic resonators;Mason transmission line model;parameter extraction;lumped Butterworth-Van Dyke model;five element BVD model;plate capacitance;resonant frequencies;effective coupling constant;quality factor;S parameters;automated data acquisition;parameter extraction method;Agilent Technologies 8753ES NWA;personal computer control;HPVEE program;MBVD circuit parameter;extraction cycle;computer controlled probing station;contour plots;resonant frequency;coupling constant;10 s","","186","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The conventional simulation model of BLDC motor is obtained by approximation of real back EMF waveform to ideal trapezoidal waveform. But as the shapes of slot, skew and magnet of BLDC motor are various subject to design purposes, the real back EMF waveform is to some degree deviant from the ideal trapezoidal waveform. As a result, when using the ideal trapezoidal waveform, the error occurs. As a consequence, in order to lessen such an error, the model of the BLDC motor with a real back EMF waveform is needed instead of its approximation model. In this paper, for the reduction of error in simulation, a new simulation model of the BLDC motor with nearly real back EMF waveform is proposed and through the simulation, the validity of the proposed model is shown for a three-phase BLDC motor.","","0-7803-6561-5","10.1109/CIPE.2000.904719","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=904719","","Brushless DC motors;Torque;Computer simulation;Motor drives;Electron traps;Shape;DC motors;Electrical equipment industry;Control system synthesis;Microprocessors","brushless DC motors;DC motor drives;machine control;machine theory;waveform analysis;SPICE;electric machine analysis computing;finite element analysis","simulation model;BLDC motor;real back EMF waveform;high speed;high power density;simulation method;drive system;controller;torque characteristic;motor drive system design;torque value prediction;back EMF waveform;brushless DC motor;trapezoidal waveform;magnet;skew;slot;approximation model;error reduction;three-phase BLDC motor;finite element analysis;MESPICE","","31","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A concise description of adaptive HE is set out, and this framework is used in a discussion of past suggestions for variations on HE. A key feature of this formalism is a ""cumulation function,"" which is used to generate a grey level mapping from the local histogram. By choosing alternative forms of cumulation function one can achieve a wide variety of effects. A specific form is proposed. Through the variation of one or two parameters, the resulting process can produce a range of degrees of contrast enhancement, at one extreme leaving the image unchanged, at another yielding full adaptive equalization.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.841534","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=841534","","Histograms;Adaptive equalizers;Image enhancement;Signal processing;Fourier series;Differential equations","adaptive signal processing;image enhancement","adaptive image contrast enhancement;generalizations;histogram equalization;adaptive HE;cumulation function;grey level mapping;adaptive equalization","","478","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

New power converter topologies permit modular realization of multilevel inverters using a hybrid approach involving integrated gate commutated thyristors (IGCTs) and insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) operating in synergism. This paper investigates a hybrid multilevel power conversion system typically suitable for high-performance high-power applications. This system, designed for a 4.16 kV/spl ges/100 hp load is comprised of a hybrid seven-level inverter, a diode bridge rectifier, and an IGBT rectifier per phase. The IGBT rectifier is used on the utility side as a real power flow regulator to the low-voltage converter and as a harmonic compensator for the high-voltage converter. The hybrid seven-level inverter on the load side consists of a high-voltage slow-switching IGCT inverter and a low-voltage fast-switching IGBT inverter. By employing different devices under different operating conditions, it is shown that one can optimize the power conversion capability of the entire system. A detailed analysis of a novel hybrid modulation technique for the inverter, which incorporates stepped synthesis in conjunction with variable pulsewidth of the consecutive steps is included. In addition, performance of a multilevel current-regulated delta modulator as applied to the single-phase full-bridge IGBT rectifier is discussed.

It is shown that cumulant-based classification is particularly effective when used in a hierarchical scheme, enabling separation into subclasses at low signal-to-noise ratio with small sample size. Thus, the method can be used as a preliminary classifier if desired. Computational complexity is order N, where N is the number of complex baseband data samples.

When developing a control system for a piezo-actuated positioning mechanism, the actuator dynamics have to be taken into account. An electromechanical piezo model, based on physical principles, is presented in this paper. In this model, a first-order differential equation is adopted to describe the hysteresis effect, and a partial differential equation is used to describe the mechanical behavior. Since, in practice, a PEA is most often used as an actuator for positioning mechanisms, we considered the influence of such a mechanism on the overall mechanical behavior of PEA and positioning mechanism together. For a well-designed mechanism, the overall mechanical behavior practically equals that of a single mass-spring-damper system, of which the undamped eigenfrequency and the relative damping can be designed favorably. With respect to traditional voltage steering, charge steering has the advantage that no hysteresis is encountered between electrical input and elongation. Electrical steering configurations for both cases of steering are presented. Finally, for the case of charge steering, we derived the total model of a piezo-actuated positioning mechanism. This model is dominated by the mechanical model, which could be designed favorably.

Conventional techniques, such as chopping or correlated double sampling, reduce the effect of 1/f noise in electronic circuits, whereas the switched biasing technique reduces the 1/f noise itself. Whereas noise reduction techniques generally lead to more power consumption, switched biasing can reduce the power consumption. It exploits an intriguing physical effect: cycling a MOS transistor from strong inversion to accumulation reduces its intrinsic 1/f noise. As the 1/f noise is reduced at its physical roots, high frequency circuits, in which 1/f noise is being upconverted, can also benefit. This is demonstrated by applying switched biasing in a 0.8 /spl mu/m CMOS sawtooth oscillator. By periodically switching off the bias currents, during time intervals that they are not contributing to the circuit operation, a reduction of the 1/f noise induced phase noise by more than 8 dB is achieved, while the power consumption is also reduced by 30%.","1558-173X","","10.1109/4.848208","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=848208","","MOSFET circuits;Power MOSFET;Noise reduction;Energy consumption;Circuit noise;Switching circuits;Phase noise;Sampling methods;Electronic circuits;Frequency","MOSFET;CMOS integrated circuits;1/f noise;semiconductor device noise;integrated circuit noise;phase noise;flicker noise;timing jitter;relaxation oscillators;waveform generators;switching;interference suppression;low-power electronics","MOSFET 1/f noise;1/f noise reduction;power consumption reduction;switched biasing;high frequency circuits;CMOS sawtooth oscillator;phase noise reduction;0.8 micron","","170","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The assumptions are that the channel model is quasi-static and that the base station has perfect channel information. In traditional TDMA or FDMA systems, resource allocation for each user is non-adaptively fixed, and the water-filling power spectrum is known to be optimal. Since the subchannel allocations among the users are not optimized, a group of users is likely to suffer from poor channel gains resulting from large path loss and random fading. To resolve this problem, we derive a multiuser convex optimization problem to find the optimal allocation of subchannels, and propose a low-complexity adaptive subchannel allocation algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs almost as well as the optimal solution. Also, a higher spectral efficiency is achieved for a larger number of users in a cell due to the multiuser diversity.","1090-3038","0-7803-5718-3","10.1109/VETECS.2000.851292","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=851292","","OFDM;Time division multiple access;Resource management;Fading;Frequency division multiaccess;Radio spectrum management;Frequency conversion;Throughput;Channel capacity;Maximum likelihood decoding","OFDM modulation;multiuser channels;channel capacity;cellular radio;channel allocation;radio links;optimisation;Rayleigh channels;adaptive systems;computational complexity;time division multiple access;frequency division multiple access","multiuser OFDM system;downlink;dynamic multiuser subchannel allocation;quasi-static channel model;base station;perfect channel information;FDMA;TDMA;resource allocation;water-filling power spectrum;channel gain;large path loss;random fading;multiuser convex optimization problem;low-complexity adaptive subchannel allocation algorithm;simulation results;optimal solution;spectral efficiency;multiuser diversity;cellular radio;frequency selective Rayleigh fading","","619","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, such accuracy is not easily attained due to various error sources that can affect the image formation process. Current calibration methods typically assume that the observations are unbiased, the only error is the zero-mean independent and identically distributed random noise in the observed image coordinates, and the camera model completely explains the mapping between the 3D coordinates and the image coordinates. In general, these conditions are not met, causing the calibration results to be less accurate than expected. In the paper, a calibration procedure for precise 3D computer vision applications is described. It introduces bias correction for circular control points and a nonrecursive method for reversing the distortion model. The accuracy analysis is presented and the error sources that can reduce the theoretical accuracy are discussed. The tests with synthetic images indicate improvements in the calibration results in limited error conditions.

S&P 2000","","2000","","","44","55","It is desirable to store data on data storage servers such as mail servers and file servers in encrypted form to reduce security and privacy risks. But this usually implies that one has to sacrifice functionality for security. For example, if a client wishes to retrieve only documents containing certain words, it was not previously known how to let the data storage server perform the search and answer the query, without loss of data confidentiality. We describe our cryptographic schemes for the problem of searching on encrypted data and provide proofs of security for the resulting crypto systems. Our techniques have a number of crucial advantages. They are provably secure: they provide provable secrecy for encryption, in the sense that the untrusted server cannot learn anything about the plaintext when only given the ciphertext; they provide query isolation for searches, meaning that the untrusted server cannot learn anything more about the plaintext than the search result; they provide controlled searching, so that the untrusted server cannot search for an arbitrary word without the user's authorization; they also support hidden queries, so that the user may ask the untrusted server to search for a secret word without revealing the word to the server. The algorithms presented are simple, fast (for a document of length n, the encryption and search algorithms only need O(n) stream cipher and block cipher operations), and introduce almost no space and communication overhead, and hence are practical to use today.","1081-6011","0-7695-0665-8","10.1109/SECPRI.2000.848445","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=848445","","Cryptography;File servers;Data security;Memory;Electronic mail;Data privacy;Authorization;US Government agencies;Contracts;Postal services","cryptography;data privacy;theorem proving;file servers;information retrieval;computational complexity","encrypted data searches;data storage servers;mail servers;file servers;privacy risks;data confidentiality;cryptographic schemes;encrypted data;crypto systems;security proofs;provable secrecy;encryption;untrusted server;plaintext;ciphertext;query isolation;search result;controlled searching;arbitrary word;user authorization;hidden queries;secret word;block cipher operations;stream cipher;communication overhead","","340","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore the need for alternative energy source is growing and the price competition of alternatives against oil is becoming more and more realistic. Electric and electric hybrid vehicles are offering the best possibility for the use of new energy sources, because electricity can result from a transformation with high efficiency of these sources and is always used with the highest possible efficiency in systems with electric drives or components.

Simple, accurate inductance expressions are used in a lumped circuit inductor model to allow the passive and active components in the circuit to be simultaneously optimized. A quick and efficient global optimization method, based on geometric programming, is discussed. The bandwidth extension technique is applied in the implementation of a 2.125-Gbaud preamplifier that employs a common-gate input stage followed by a cascoded common-source stage. On-chip shunt peaking is introduced at the dominant pole to improve the overall system performance, including a 40% increase in the transimpedance.

"Sampling-50 years after Shannon","M. Unser","Biomed. Imaging Group, Swiss Fed. Inst. of Technol., Lausanne, Switzerland","Proceedings of the IEEE","","2000","88","4","569","587","This paper presents an account of the current state of sampling, 50 years after Shannon's formulation of the sampling theorem. The emphasis is on regular sampling, where the grid is uniform. This topic has benefitted from a strong research revival during the past few years, thanks in part to the mathematical connections that were made with wavelet theory. To introduce the reader to the modern, Hilbert-space formulation, we reinterpret Shannon's sampling procedure as an orthogonal projection onto the subspace of band-limited functions. We then extend the standard sampling paradigm for a presentation of functions in the more general class of ""shift-in-variant"" function spaces, including splines and wavelets. Practically, this allows for simpler-and possibly more realistic-interpolation models, which can be used in conjunction with a much wider class of (anti-aliasing) prefilters that are not necessarily ideal low-pass. We summarize and discuss the results available for the determination of the approximation error and of the sampling rate when the input of the system is essentially arbitrary; e.g., nonbandlimited. We also review variations of sampling that can be understood from the same unifying perspective. These include wavelets, multiwavelets, Papoulis generalized sampling, finite elements, and frames. Irregular sampling and radial basis functions are briefly mentioned.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.843002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=843002","","Sampling methods;Signal sampling;Frequency;Image reconstruction;Approximation error;Finite element methods;Hilbert space;Interpolation;Least squares approximation;Information theory","information theory;signal sampling;wavelet transforms;Hilbert spaces;splines (mathematics);interpolation;radial basis function networks;least squares approximations","Shannon's formulation;sampling theorem;regular sampling;wavelet theory;Hilbert-space formulation;orthogonal projection;band-limited functions;sampling paradigm;shift-in-variant function spaces;splines;interpolation models;anti-aliasing prefilters;approximation error;sampling rate;nonbandlimited input;multiwavelets;Papoulis generalized sampling;finite elements;frames;irregular sampling;radial basis functions","","788","","149","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Mersman","Kansas State Univ., Manhattan, KS, USA; NA; NA","IEEE Power Engineering Review","","2000","20","11","8","11","This article presents a comparative study of the performance of two types of battery chargers being developed for electric vehicles. The first charger is a microprocessor-based ferroresonant battery charger, referred to as the ferroresonant charger. The power delivery section of this charger is a ferroresonant transformer, which exploits the saturation of magnetic materials through its capacitor winding to produce a well-regulated output that resembles a square wave. The control section periodically places a resistive load across the battery under charge that allows this change in resistance to be detected. A microprocessor controls the timing and executes the gating of the needed switches in the circuit and then gathers and analyzes data from the battery charge monitor circuit. The monitor circuit measures the voltage drop across the battery, which is proportional to the battery internal resistance when the load is introduced. The second charger is a multiphase AC-to-DC converter that employs two three-phase transformers to create twelve phases and is called the twelve-phase charger. One transformer primary is in the delta configuration, and the other transformer primary is in the wye configuration. The center-tapped secondaries create the twelve phases. Thyristors are used to control the output voltage of the charger through digital control of the firing angle. A microprocessor controls the charging profile of the battery. A motor-generator set is used to simulate the load to the charger for test conditions.","1558-1705","","10.1109/39.883280","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=883280","","Batteries;Electric vehicles;Ferroresonance;Circuit faults;Microprocessors;Monitoring;Load flow;Load flow analysis;Magnetic materials;Capacitors","electric vehicles;battery chargers;ferroresonant circuits;microcomputer applications;digital control;voltage measurement;AC-DC power convertors;transformers;thyristor applications;secondary cells;voltage control;power engineering computing","electric vehicles;battery chargers;microprocessor-based ferroresonant battery charger;ferroresonant charger;power delivery section;ferroresonant transformer;magnetic materials saturation;capacitor winding;square wave output;resistive load;microprocessor controls;battery charge monitor circuit;monitor circuit;voltage drop measurement;battery internal resistance;multiphase AC-to-DC converter;three-phase transformers;twelve-phase charger;delta configuration;wye configuration;center-tapped secondaries;thyristors;output voltage control;digital control;motor-generator set","","38","","2","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Some of the pitfalls of naive penalty methods are discussed in these terms. The new ranking method is tested using a (/spl mu/, /spl lambda/) evolution strategy on 13 benchmark problems.

A plot of the operating characteristic shows that the authors' method reduces false positives by as much as 15 times over basic thresholding of a matched filter response (MFR), at up to a 75% true positive rate. For a baseline, they also compared the ground truth against a second hand-labeling, yielding a 90% true positive and a 4% false positive detection rate, on average.

Similarly, commonly used multilevel inverter modulation schemes generate common-mode voltages. Common-mode voltages may cause motor shaft voltages and bearing currents and conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI). Premature motor bearing failures and electronic equipment malfunctions have been reported to be directly related to bearing currents and EMI. In this paper, approaches to eliminating common-mode voltage when using multilevel PWM inverters are presented. It is shown that inverters, which have an odd number of levels, will generate zero common-mode voltage by switching among certain states. Therefore, motor bearing currents will be eliminated and conducted EMI will be reduced. Both sinusoidal PWM and space-vector modulation (SVM) schemes are discussed and detailed comparative simulation results between conventional and novel modulation schemes are provided.

Underwater acoustic (UWA) networks are generally formed by acoustically connected ocean-bottom sensors, autonomous underwater vehicles, and a surface station, which provides a link to an on-shore control center. While many applications require long-term monitoring of the deployment area, the battery-powered network nodes limit the lifetime of UWA networks. In addition, shallow-water acoustic channel characteristics, such as low available bandwidth, highly varying multipath, and large propagation delays, restrict the efficiency of UWA networks. Within such an environment, designing an UWA network that maximizes throughput and reliability while minimizing the power consumption becomes a very difficult task. The goal of this paper is to survey the existing network technology and its applicability to underwater acoustic channels.

Res., Tokyo, Japan","IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","","2000","47","6","1277","1290","Electrets of carnauba wax and resin have exhibited good stability of trapped charges for nearly 50 years. Dipolar orientation and trapped charge are two mechanisms contributing to the pyro-, piezo-, and ferroelectricity of polymers. Since the 1950s, shear piezoelectricity was investigated in polymers of biological origin (such as cellulose and collagen) as well as synthetic optically active polymers (such as polyamides and polylactic acids). Since the discovery of piezoelectricity in poled polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in 1969, the pyro-, piezo-, and ferroelectricity were widely investigated in a number of polar polymers, such as copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and trifluoroethylene, copolymers of vinylcyanide and vinylacetate, and nylons. Recent studies involve submicron films of aromatic and aliphatic polyureas prepared by vapor deposition polymerization in vacuum and the piezoelectricity of polyurethane produced by the coupling of electrostriction and bias electric fields. Gramophone pickups using a piece of bone or tendon were demonstrated in 1959. Microphones using a stretched film of polymethyl glutamate were reported in 1968. Ultrasonic transducers using elongated and poled films of PVDF were demonstrated in 1972. Headphones and tweeters using PVDF were marketed in 1975. Hydrophones and various electromechanical devices utilizing PVDP and its copolymers have been developed during the past 30 years. This paper briefly reviews the history and recent progress in piezoelectric polymers.","1525-8955","","10.1109/58.883516","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=883516","","History;Piezoelectricity;Optical polymers;Piezoelectric films;Polymer films;Electrets;Resins;Stability;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical films","piezoelectric materials;optical polymers;polymer blends;ferroelectricity;polymerisation;electrostriction;pick-ups;ultrasonic transducers;headphones;hydrophones;microphones","piezoelectric polymers;carnauba wax;dipolar orientation;trapped charge;shear piezoelectricity;optically active polymers;ferroelectricity;copolymers;submicron films;vapor deposition polymerization;electrostriction;gramophone pickups;ultrasonic transducers;poled films;headphones;tweeters;hydrophones","","317","","65","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

They convert almost 60% of the electricity produced in the US into other forms of energy to provide power to other equipment. In the performance of all motor systems, bearings play an important role. Many problems arising in motor operations are linked to bearing faults. In many cases, the accuracy of the instruments and devices used to monitor and control the motor system is highly dependent on the dynamic performance of the motor bearings. Thus, fault diagnosis of a motor system is inseparably related to the diagnosis of the bearing assembly. In this paper, bearing vibration frequency features are discussed for motor bearing fault diagnosis. This paper then presents an approach for motor rolling bearing fault diagnosis using neural networks and time/frequency-domain bearing vibration analysis. Vibration simulation is used to assist in the design of various motor rolling bearing fault diagnosis strategies. Both simulation and real-world testing results obtained indicate that neural networks can be effective agents in the diagnosis of various motor bearing faults through the measurement and interpretation of motor bearing vibration signatures.","1557-9948","","10.1109/41.873214","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=873214","","Rolling bearings;Fault diagnosis;Neural networks;Vibration measurement;Energy conversion;Instruments;Monitoring;Control systems;Assembly systems;Frequency","electric motors;neural nets;fault diagnosis;machine bearings;electric machine analysis computing;frequency-domain analysis;time-domain analysis;vibrations","neural-network;motor rolling bearing fault diagnosis;bearing vibration frequency;motor bearing fault diagnosis;time-domain bearing vibration analysis;vibration simulation;frequency-domain bearing vibration analysis","","405","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The device is fabricated in a silicon wafer using a double-sided KOH wet-etching technique to realize a three-dimensional channel geometry. Experiments using phenolphthalein and sodium hydroxide solutions demonstrate the ability of flow in this channel to mix faster and more uniformly than either pure molecular diffusion or flow in a ""square-wave"" channel for Reynolds numbers from 6 to 70. The mixing capability of the channel increases with increasing Reynolds number. At least 98% of the maximum intensity of reacted phenolphthalein is observed in the channel after five mixing segments for Reynolds numbers greater than 25. At a Reynolds number of 70, the serpentine channel produces 16 times more reacted phenolphthalein than a straight channel and 1.6 times more than the square-wave channel. Mixing rates in the serpentine channel at the higher Reynolds numbers are consistent with the occurrence of chaotic advection. Visualization of the interface formed in the channel between streams of water and ethyl alcohol indicates that the mixing is due to both diffusion and fluid stirring.","1941-0158","","10.1109/84.846699","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=846699","","Microchannel;Chaos;Biochemistry;Chemicals;Silicon;Geometry;Visualization;Biochemical analysis;Drug delivery;Biological processes","microfluidics;mixing;chaos;channel flow","passive mixing;three-dimensional serpentine microchannel;chaotic advection;silicon wafer;KOH wet etching;phenolphthalein;sodium hydroxide solution;Reynolds number;water;ethyl alcohol;diffusion;fluid stirring;flow visualization;Si","","796","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, incorporating the power balance of the input and output sides in system modeling, a nonlinear model of the PWM converter is derived with state variables such as AC input currents and DC output voltage. Then, by input-output feedback linearization, the system is linearized and a state feedback control law is obtained by pole placement. With this control scheme, output voltage responses become faster than those in a conventional cascade control structure. For robust control to parameter variations, integrators are added to the exact feedback control law. Since the fast voltage control is feasible for load changes, it is shown that the DC electrolytic capacitor size can be reduced. In addition, the capacitor current is analyzed for size reduction of the capacitor. As is usual with PWM converters, the input current is regulated to be sinusoidal and the source power factor can be controlled at unity.

This system operating at 1150 MHz or 450 MHz can detect the breathing and heartbeat signals of human subjects through an earthquake rubble or a construction barrier of about 10-ft thickness. The basic physical principle for the operation of a microwave life-detection system is rather simple. When a microwave beam of appropriate frequency (L or S band) is aimed at a pile of earthquake rubble covering a human subject or illuminated through a barrier obstructing a human subject, the microwave beam can penetrate the rubble or the barrier to reach the human subject. When the human subject is illuminated by a microwave beam, the reflected wave from the human subject will be modulated by tile subject's body movements, which include the breathing and the heartbeat. If the clutter consisting of the reflected wave from stationary background can be completely eliminated and the reflected wave from the human subject's body is properly modulated, the breathing and heartbeat signals of the subject can be extracted. Thus, a human subject buried under earthquake rubble or hidden behind barriers can be located. This system has been tested extensively in a simulated earthquake rubble in the laboratory and also in a field test using realistic earthquake rubble conducted by a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Task Force.","1558-2531","","10.1109/10.817625","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=817625","","Earthquakes;Heart beat;Structural beams;System testing;Frequency;Optical modulation;Biological system modeling;Laboratories","earthquakes;microwave measurement;cardiology;pneumodynamics;biomedical equipment","human subjects searching;behind barrier;under earthquake rubble;microwave life-detection systems;construction barrier;heartbeat signals;breathing signals;reflected wave;laboratory tests;stationary background;Federal Emergency Management Agency Task Force;field tests;clutter cancelation;1150 MHz;450 MHz;10 feet","Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Equipment Design;Humans;Microwaves;Models, Theoretical;Monitoring, Physiologic;Natural Disasters;Physical Examination;Pulse;Relief Work;Respiration;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Telemetry","278","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is conceived as a ""low complexity projection"" of the universal context modeling paradigm, matching its modeling unit to a simple coding unit. By combining simplicity with the compression potential of context models, the algorithm ""enjoys the best of both worlds."" It is based on a simple fixed context model, which approaches the capability of the more complex universal techniques for capturing high-order dependencies. The model is tuned for efficient performance in conjunction with an extended family of Golomb (1966) type codes, which are adaptively chosen, and an embedded alphabet extension for coding of low-entropy image regions. LOCO-I attains compression ratios similar or superior to those obtained with state-of-the-art schemes based on arithmetic coding.

There are two major shortcomings of the traditional approaches to fingerprint representation. For a considerable fraction of population, the representations based on explicit detection of complete ridge structures in the fingerprint are difficult to extract automatically. The widely used minutiae-based representation does not utilize a significant component of the rich discriminatory information available in the fingerprints. Local ridge structures cannot be completely characterized by minutiae. Further, minutiae-based matching has difficulty in quickly matching two fingerprint images containing a different number of unregistered minutiae points. The proposed filter-based algorithm uses a bank of Gabor filters to capture both local and global details in a fingerprint as a compact fixed length FingerCode. The fingerprint matching is based on the Euclidean distance between the two corresponding FingerCodes and hence is extremely fast. We are able to achieve a verification accuracy which is only marginally inferior to the best results of minutiae-based algorithms published in the open literature. Our system performs better than a state-of-the-art minutiae-based system when the performance requirement of the application system does not demand a very low false acceptance rate. Finally, we show that the matching performance can be improved by combining the decisions of the matchers based on complementary (minutiae-based and filter-based) fingerprint information.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.841531","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=841531","","Matched filters;Fingerprint recognition;Biometrics;Gabor filters;Image matching;Information filtering;Information filters;Licenses;Intelligent robots;Societies","fingerprint identification;image matching;feature extraction;digital filters","filterbank-based fingerprint matching;biometrics-based verification;fingerprint-based identification;ridge structures;minutiae;fingerprint images;filter-based algorithm;Gabor filters;compact fixed length FingerCode;fingerprint matching;Euclidean distance;verification accuracy;performance","","714","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The aluminum oxide was produced by thermally oxidizing AlN at 800-1160/spl deg/C under dry O/sub 2/ conditions. The AlN films were deposited by RF magnetron sputtering on p-type Si (100) substrates. Thermal oxidation produced Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ with a thickness and structure that depended on the process time and temperature. The MIS capacitors exhibited the charge regimes of accumulation, depletion, and inversion on the Si semiconductor surface. The best electrical properties were obtained when all of the AlN was fully oxidized to Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ with no residual AlN. The MIS flatband voltage was near 0 V, the net oxide trapped charge density, Q/sub 0x/, was less than 10/sup 11/ cm/sup -2/, and the interface trap density, D/sub it/, was less than 10/sup 11/ cm/sup -2/ eV/sup -1/, At an oxide electric field of 0.3 MV/cm, the leakage current density was less than 10/sup -7/ A cm/sup -2/, with a resistivity greater than 10/sup 12/ /spl Omega/-cm. The critical field for dielectric breakdown ranged from 4 to 5 MV/cm. The temperature dependence of the current versus electric field indicated that the conduction mechanism was Frenkel-Poole emission, which has the property that higher temperatures reduce the current. This may be important for the reliability of circuits operating under extreme conditions. The dielectric constant ranged from 3 to 9.

"Perceptual coding of digital audio","T. Painter; A. Spanias","Dept. of Electr. Eng., Arizona State Univ., Tempe, AZ, USA; NA","Proceedings of the IEEE","","2000","88","4","451","515","During the last decade, CD-quality digital audio has essentially replaced analog audio. Emerging digital audio applications for network, wireless, and multimedia computing systems face a series of constraints such as reduced channel bandwidth, limited storage capacity, and low cost. These new applications have created a demand for high-quality digital audio delivery at low bit rates. In response to this need, considerable research has been devoted to the development of algorithms for perceptually transparent coding of high-fidelity (CD-quality) digital audio. As a result, many algorithms have been proposed, and several have now become international and/or commercial product standards. This paper reviews algorithms for perceptually transparent coding of CD-quality digital audio, including both research and standardization activities. This paper is organized as follows. First, psychoacoustic principles are described, with the MPEG psychoacoustic signal analysis model 1 discussed in some detail. Next, filter bank design issues and algorithms are addressed, with a particular emphasis placed on the modified discrete cosine transform, a perfect reconstruction cosine-modulated filter bank that has become of central importance in perceptual audio coding. Then, we review methodologies that achieve perceptually transparent coding of FM- and CD-quality audio signals, including algorithms that manipulate transform components, subband signal decompositions, sinusoidal signal components, and linear prediction parameters, as well as hybrid algorithms that make use of more than one signal model. These discussions concentrate on architectures and applications of those techniques that utilize psychoacoustic models to exploit efficiently masking characteristics of the human receiver. Several algorithms that have become international and/or commercial standards receive in-depth treatment, including the ISO/IEC MPEG family (-1, -2, -4), the Lucent Technologies PAC/EPAC/MPAC, the Dolby AC-2/AC-3, and the Sony ATRAC/SDDS algorithms. Then, we describe subjective evaluation methodologies in some detail, including the ITU-R BS.1116 recommendation on subjective measurements of small impairments. This paper concludes with a discussion of future research directions.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.842996","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=842996","","Psychoacoustic models;Psychology;Filter bank;IEC standards;ISO standards;Multimedia computing;Bandwidth;Costs;Bit rate;Standardization","audio coding;telecommunication standards;channel bank filters;discrete cosine transforms;linear predictive coding","perceptual coding;digital audio;channel bandwidth;storage capacity;high-quality digital audio delivery;bit rates;transparent coding;standards;psychoacoustic principles;MPEG psychoacoustic signal analysis model 1;filter bank design;modified discrete cosine transform;perfect reconstruction cosine-modulated filter bank;subband signal decompositions;sinusoidal signal components;linear prediction parameters;hybrid algorithms;signal model;ISO/IEC MPEG family;Lucent Technologies;PAC;EPAC;MPAC;Dolby AC-2;Dolby AC-3;Sony ATRAC algorithm;Sony SDDS algorithm;subjective evaluation methodologies;ITU-R BS.1116 recommendation","","465","","405","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the scheme, we use a path time delay estimation method to improve the accuracy of the correlation-based symbol synchronization methods, and use a delay-locked loop (DLL) to do the sampling clock synchronization. It is shown that by using this scheme, the mean square values of the symbol timing estimation error can be decreased by several orders of magnitude compared to the common correlation methods in both the AWGN and multipath fading channels.

Results demonstrate that circular polarization of both senses can be achieved with a ring antenna with proper design of two inner stubs located at angles of /spl plusmn/45/spl deg/ with respect to the feedline. Theory and experiment demonstrate an axial ratio 3-dB bandwidth of 1% and the voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) <2 bandwidth of 6.1%. The axial ratio bandwidth is typical for a microstrip antenna with perturbations, while the VSWR bandwidth is larger than for the circular or rectangular patch with perturbations.

The model restricts the locations where some turns can be taken so that deadlock is avoided. In comparison with previous methods, the degree of routing adaptiveness provided by the model is more even for different source-destination pairs. The mesh network may benefit from this feature in terms of communication efficiency. Simulation results show that the even adaptiveness provided by the odd-even turn model makes message routing less vulnerable to nonuniform factors such as hot spot traffic. In addition, this property results in a smaller fluctuation of the network performance with respect to different traffic patterns.","1558-2183","","10.1109/71.877831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=877831","","Routing;System recovery;Algorithm design and analysis;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Communication system control;Computer Society;Mesh networks;Fluctuations","network routing;multiprocessor interconnection networks","odd-even turn model;adaptive routing;wormhole routing;meshes without virtual channels;routing adaptiveness","","535","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It covers the application of expert systems, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and fuzzy logic systems that can be integrated into each other and also with more traditional techniques. The application of genetic algorithms is considered as well. In general, a diagnostic procedure starts from a fault tree developed on the basis of the physical behavior of the electrical system under consideration. In this phase, the knowledge of well-tested models able to simulate the electrical machine in different fault conditions is fundamental to obtain the patterns characterizing the faults. The fault tree navigation performed by an expert system inference engine leads to the choice of suitable diagnostic indexes, referred to a particular fault, and relevant to build an input data set for specific AI (NNs, fuzzy logic, or neuro-fuzzy) systems. The discussed methodologies, that play a general role in the diagnostic field, are applied to an induction machine, utilizing as input signals the instantaneous voltages and currents. In addition, the supply converter is also considered to incorporate in the diagnostic procedure the most typical failures of power electronic components. A brief description of the various AI techniques is also given; this highlights the advantages and the limitations of using AI techniques.

No.00CH37069)","","2000","1","","127","132","This paper presents a new type of MEMS (micro-electromechanical systems) actuator consisting of an array of in-plane micro-fabricated thermal buckle-beam actuators. The technology used in MEMS actuators is typically magnetic, electrostatic or thermal. Magnetic actuators may require special materials in the fabrication process while electrostatic actuators typically require high voltages, large chip areas and produce very low forces. Thermal actuators have seen some use in MEMS applications, the most popular being the pseudo-bimorph that relies on differential expansion of a cold and hot arm to cause it to bend in-plane (parallel to the substrate). These thermal actuators typically generate on the order of a few micro-Newtons each but can be combined for larger forces by linking with small tendons. A disadvantage of this type of actuator is that it moves in an are where most desired movements are linear. Also, when combined in an array, the linking tendons consume much of the energy in bending them. Also, arrays of these can still occupy a fairly large chip area. The electro-thermal actuator described here resembles a chevron where an array of buckle-beams are packed close together and link two common anchored arms with a movable third arm. Arrays can be made within a single released micromachined layer and generate many mN of force. Additional actuators can be arrayed with no coupling penalty and occupy much less area that an equivalent pseudo-bimorph actuator. Preliminary tests indicate that a 450/spl times/120 /spl mu/m array consumes 240 mW of power, deflection up to 14 /spl mu/m and can produce many milli-Newtons. A chip of actuator geometry variations and different applications has been fabricated and tested.","1089-9870","0-7803-5912-7","10.1109/ITHERM.2000.866818","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=866818","","Thermal force;Micromechanical devices;Electrostatic actuators;Magnetic materials;Joining processes;Tendons;Testing;Microelectromechanical systems;Fabrication;Voltage","microactuators","MEMS thermal actuator;microelectromechanical system;microfabrication;buckle beam array","","63","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Effect of simulation methodology on solder joint crack growth correlation","R.

No.00CH37070)","","2000","","","1048","1058","A generalized solder joint fatigue life model for surface mount packages was previously published by the author. The model is based on correlation to measured crack growth data on BGA joints during thermal cycling. It was subsequently discovered by Anderson et. al. that the ANSYS/sup TM/ 5.2 finite element code used in the model had an error in its method for calculating plastic work. It was shown that significant error in life prediction could result by using a recent version of the code where the bug has been fixed. The error comes about since the original crack growth constants were derived based on plastic work calculations that had the bug. In this paper, crack initiation and growth constants are recalculated using ANSYS/sup TM/ 5.6. In addition, several other model related issues are explored with respect to the crack growth correlations. For example, 3D slice models were compared to quarter symmetry models. Anand's constitutive model was compared with Darveaux's constitutive model. It was shown that the crack growth rate dependence on strain energy density always had an exponent of 1.10+/-0.15. This is in the range of the original correlation, so the accuracy of relative predictions should still be within+/-25%. However, the accuracy of absolute predictions could be off by a factor of 7 in the worst case, if the analyst uses a modeling procedure that is not consistent with that used for the crack growth correlation.

The rationale for pursuing electromagnetic methods is strong given the data in the literature, which show that the electromagnetic properties of breast malignancy are significantly different than normal in the high megahertz to low gigahertz spectral range, microwave illumination can effectively penetrate the breast at these frequencies, and the breast is a small readily accessible tissue volume, making it an ideal site for deploying advanced near-field imaging concepts that exploit model-based image reconstruction methodology. In this paper a clinical prototype of a microwave imaging system, which actively illuminates the breast with a 16-element transceiving monopole antenna array in the 300-1000 MHz range, is reported. Microwave exams have been delivered to five women through a water-coupled interface to the pendant breast with the participant positioned prone on an examination table. This configuration has been found to be a practical, comfortable approach to microwave breast imaging. Sessions lasted 10-15 min per breast and included full tomographic data acquisition at seven different array heights beginning at the chest wall and moving anteriorly toward the nipple for seven different frequencies at each array position. This clinical experience appears to be the first report of active near-field microwave imaging of the breast and is certainly the first attempt to exploit model-based image reconstructions from in vivo breast data in order to convert the measured microwave signals into spatial maps of electrical permittivity and conductivity. While clearly preliminary, the results are encouraging and have supplied some interesting findings. Specifically, it appears that the average relative permittivity of the breast as a whole correlates with radiologic breast density categorization and may be considerably higher than previously published values, which have been based on ex vivo tissue specimens.","1557-9670","","10.1109/22.883861","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=883861","","Prototypes;Microwave imaging;Breast;Frequency;Image reconstruction;Microwave antenna arrays;Permittivity;Optical imaging;Character recognition;X-ray detection","microwave imaging;mammography;permittivity measurement;image reconstruction;medical image processing;cancer;biomedical equipment","clinical prototype;active microwave imaging;breast imaging;breast disease;electromagnetic methods;electromagnetic properties;breast malignancy;microwave illumination;small readily accessible tissue volume;model-based image reconstruction methodology;microwave imaging system;16-element transceiving monopole antenna array;water-coupled interface;pendant breast;electrical permittivity;spatial maps;radiologic breast density categorization;300 to 1000 MHz;10 to 15 min","","414","","54","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Automatic analysis of the difference image for unsupervised change detection","L. Bruzzone; D. F. Prieto","Trento Univ., Italy; NA","IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","2000","38","3","1171","1182","One of the main problems related to unsupervised change detection methods based on the ""difference image"" lies in the lack of efficient automatic techniques for discriminating between changed and unchanged pixels in the difference image. Such discrimination is usually performed by using empirical strategies or manual trial-and-error procedures, which affect both the accuracy and the reliability of the change-detection process. To overcome such drawbacks, in this paper, the authors propose two automatic techniques (based on the Bayes theory) for the analysis of the difference image. One allows an automatic selection of the decision threshold that minimizes the overall change detection error probability under the assumption that pixels in the difference image are independent of one another. The other analyzes the difference image by considering the spatial-contextual information included in the neighborhood of each pixel. In particular, an approach based on Markov Random Fields (MRFs) that exploits interpixel class dependency contexts is presented. Both proposed techniques require the knowledge of the statistical distributions of the changed and unchanged pixels in the difference image. To perform an unsupervised estimation of the statistical terms that characterize these distributions, they propose an iterative method based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of both proposed techniques.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.843009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=843009","","Image analysis;Pixel;Remote monitoring;Multispectral imaging;Image generation;Error probability;Information analysis;Markov random fields;Statistical distributions;Iterative methods","geophysical techniques;geophysical signal processing;remote sensing;image sequences;Bayes methods;terrain mapping;Markov processes","geophysical measurement technique;land surface;terrain mapping;remote sensing;image processing;image sequence;automatic analysis;difference image;unsupervised change detection;Bayes theory;automatic selection;decision threshold;spatial-contextual information;Markov Random Field;interpixel class dependency context;statistical distribution;iterative method;expectation maximization algorithm;multitemporal image","","699","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Today's voltage regulator module (VRM) will need a large amount of extra decoupling and output filter capacitors to meet future requirements, which will basically make the existing VRM topologies impractical. As a candidate topology, the interleaved quasisquare-wave (QSW) VRM exhibits very good performance, such as a fast transient response and a very high power density. The difficulty with the application of the interleaved parallel technology is the current-sharing control. In this paper, a novel current-sensing and current-sharing technique is proposed. With this technique, current sharing can be controlled simply in parallel converters without a current transformer and current-sensing resistors. In addition, this technique can be easily integrated with an IC chip. The four-module paralleled QSW VRM is used to evaluate this technique. Experimental results verify that with this technique, the VRM has a high power density, high efficiency and a fast transient response. The concept of the current sharing technique is also generalized and extended.","1941-0107","","10.1109/63.892830","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=892830","","Voltage control;Regulators;Microprocessors;Capacitors;Rectifiers;Transient response;Power supplies;Inductance;Filters;Topology","voltage regulators;DC-DC power convertors;computer power supplies;microprocessor chips;electric current control;transient response","low-voltage high-current voltage regulator;current-sharing control technique;microprocessors;transient slew rate;voltage regulator module;decoupling;output filter capacitors;interleaved quasisquare-wave VRM;transient response;power density;interleaved parallel technology;current-sensing;parallel power converters;IC chip;power MOSFET switches","","164","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The excellent phase-noise performance is achieved by means of an in-house-developed integrated inductor simulator optimizer. To minimize the upconversion of flicker noise to 1/f/sup 3/ phase noise, a flicker-noise upconversion factor is defined, which can easily be extracted from circuit simulation. The technique is applied to demonstrate the relationship between the flicker-noise upconversion and the overdrive level of the oscillators' MOS cross-coupled pair and to develop circuit balancing techniques to even further reduce the flicker-noise upconversion.

The overall performance can be optimized by judiciously choosing a combination of parameters. In particular, it is found that smaller circular slot cavities terminating the bilateral slotline improve the performance near the low end of the operating band, especially when scanning in the H-plane. The opening rate of the tapered slotline mainly determines the mid-band performance and it is possible to choose an opening rate to obtain balanced overall performance in the mid-band.

This paper reports on measurements of the mechanical quality factor Q for arrays of silicon-nitride, polysilicon, and single-crystal silicon cantilevers. By studying the dependence of Q on cantilever material, geometry, and surface treatments, significant insight into dissipation mechanisms has been obtained. For submicron-thick cantilevers, Q is found to decrease with decreasing cantilever thickness, indicating surface loss mechanisms. For single-crystal silicon cantilevers, significant increase in room temperature Q is obtained after 700/spl deg/C heat treatment in either N/sub 2/ Or forming gas. At low temperatures, silicon cantilevers exhibit a minimum in Q at approximately 135 K, possibly due to a surface-related relaxation process.

Hence, the proposed rectifier requires neither a large DC capacitor nor a passive L-C resonant circuit. The input current control is achieved by the conventional PWM current control technique. However, DC ripple current reduction control is difficult because one of the switching legs in the DC ripple current reduction circuit is shared with the PWM rectifier circuit. Two control methods, referred to here as the DC C inductor method and the AC inductor method, are proposed for DC ripple reduction, and the characteristics of these control methods are discussed.

Much of the literature has focused on developing the best uniform threshold or best basis selection. However, not much has been done to make the threshold values adaptive to the spatially changing statistics of images. Such adaptivity can improve the wavelet thresholding performance because it allows additional local information of the image (such as the identification of smooth or edge regions) to be incorporated into the algorithm. This work proposes a spatially adaptive wavelet thresholding method based on context modeling, a common technique used in image compression to adapt the coder to changing image characteristics. Each wavelet coefficient is modeled as a random variable of a generalized Gaussian distribution with an unknown parameter. Context modeling is used to estimate the parameter for each coefficient, which is then used to adapt the thresholding strategy. This spatially adaptive thresholding is extended to the overcomplete wavelet expansion, which yields better results than the orthogonal transform. Experimental results show that spatially adaptive wavelet thresholding yields significantly superior image quality and lower MSE than the best uniform thresholding with the original image assumed known.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.862630","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=862630","","Context modeling;Noise reduction;Statistics;Image coding;Wavelet coefficients;Random variables;Gaussian distribution;Parameter estimation;Wavelet transforms;Image quality","Noise;Interference suppression;Adaptive signal processing;Wavelet transforms;Image enhancement","spatially adaptive wavelet thresholding;context modeling;image denoising;noise;spatially changing statistics;local information;random variable;generalized Gaussian distribution;overcomplete wavelet expansion;orthogonal transform;image quality;MSE","","557","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Discrete chirp-Fourier transform and its application to chirp rate estimation","Xiang-Gen Xia","Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Delaware Univ., Newark, DE, USA","IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","","2000","48","11","3122","3133","The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) has found tremendous applications in almost all fields, mainly because it can be used to match the multiple frequencies of a stationary signal with multiple harmonics. In many applications, wideband and nonstationary signals, however, often occur. One of the typical examples of such signals is chirp-type signals that are usually encountered in radar signal processing, such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and inverse SAR imaging. Due to the motion of a target, the radar return signals are usually chirps, and their chirp rates include the information about the target, such as the location and the velocity. In this paper, we study discrete chirp-Fourier transform (DCFT), which is analogous to the DFT. Besides the multiple frequency matching similar to the DFT, the DCFT can be used to match the multiple chirp rates in a chirp-type signal with multiple chirp components. We show that when the signal length N is prime, the magnitudes of all the sidelobes of the DCFT of a quadratic chirp signal are 1, whereas the magnitude of the mainlobe of the DCFT is /spl radic/N. With this result, an upper bound for the number of the detectable chirp components using the DCFT is provided in terms of signal length and signal and noise powers. We also show that the N-point DCFT performs optimally when N is a prime.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.875469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=875469","","Chirp;Discrete transforms;Discrete Fourier transforms;Frequency;Signal processing;Wideband;Radar signal processing;Synthetic aperture radar;Radar polarimetry;Radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar;radar imaging;discrete Fourier transforms;chirp modulation;parameter estimation","discrete chirp-Fourier transform;chirp rate estimation;discrete Fourier transform;DFT;stationary signal;multiple harmonics;wideband signals;nonstationary signals;radar signal processing;synthetic aperture rada;SAR;inverse SAR imaging;radar return signals;DCFT;multiple frequency matching;chirp-type signal;signal length;noise powers;N-point DCFT","","204","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The time evolution of these PDEs seeks to minimize a cost functional which is an increasing function of the absolute value of the Laplacian of the image intensity function. Since the Laplacian of an image at a pixel is zero if the image is planar in its neighborhood, these PDEs attempt to remove noise and preserve edges by approximating an observed image with a piecewise planar image. Piecewise planar images look more natural than step images which anisotropic diffusion (second order PDEs) uses to approximate an observed image. So the proposed PDEs are able to avoid the blocky effects widely seen in images processed by anisotropic diffusion, while achieving the degree of noise removal and edge preservation comparable to anisotropic diffusion. Although both approaches seem to be comparable in removing speckles in the observed images, speckles are more visible in images processed by the proposed PDEs, because piecewise planar images are less likely to mask speckles than step images and anisotropic diffusion tends to generate multiple false edges. Speckles can be easily removed by simple algorithms such as the one presented in this paper.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.869184","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=869184","","Partial differential equations;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Boundary conditions;Laplace equations;Cost function;Pixel;Smoothing methods;Image enhancement;Image analysis;Level set","Laplace equations;speckle;noise;image enhancement","fourth-order partial differential equations;noise removal;edge preservation;time evolution;PDE;cost functional;Laplacian;image intensity function;piecewise planar image;speckles","","503","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, we analytically derive the average size of the contention window that maximizes the throughput, hereafter theoretical throughput limit, and we show that: 1) depending on the network configuration, the standard can operate very far from the theoretical throughput limit; and 2) an appropriate tuning of the backoff algorithm can drive the IEEE 802.11 protocol close to the theoretical throughput limit. Hence we propose a distributed algorithm that enables each station to tune its backoff algorithm at run-time. The performances of the IEEE 802.11 protocol, enhanced with our algorithm, are extensively investigated by simulation.

This is manifested through the increased energy efficiency of equipment and processes using electrical power, and through higher industrial productivity and higher product quality, which results from the ability to control precisely the electrical power for manufacturing operations. Sales of power electronics equipment exceed $60 billion each year, and affect another $1 trillion in hardware electronics sales. Improvements in the technology of such a dynamic market is an exciting endeavor. Industrial firms are under constant pressure to produce power electronics products that are more powerful dependable and durable, smaller in size, lighter in weight, and less costly to the consumer. Power electronics products, to date, are essentially custom-designed, with a long design cycle time. The equipment is designed and manufactured largely using nonstandard parts. Thus, manufacturing processes are labor-intensive, resulting in high cost and poor reliability. Consequently, the US is losing its manufacturing base to global competitors, especially in those regions where labor costs are significantly lower than those of the US.

This ensures coherence in the way we model data and yields good performance. We have tested our approach in a variety of experimental conditions and report excellent results.

The blockset uses the MATLAB/Simulink environment to represent common components and devices found in electrical power networks. Simulink's variable-step event-sensitive integration algorithms allow increased accuracy in zero-crossing detection of currents as compared with fixed step algorithms. One important feature of the Power System Blockset which has been introduced with version 2.0 is its ability to simulate either with continuous variable time-step integration algorithms or with a discretized system. For small and medium size systems, variable time steps algorithms are usually faster because the number of steps will be less than with a fixed-time step method. However, for large systems which contain many states or many nonlinear blocks such as power electronic switches, it is advantageous to discretize the electrical system. Both the continuous integration and fixed-time step methods are illustrated. The graphic interface of Simulink provides a user-friendly environment where the power circuit and control system are represented in the same diagram. The results are displayed while the simulation is running. The processing power of MATLAB allows the designer to perform complex post-processing on simulation results.

By using a survey instrument we investigate this claim further. The investigation addresses the following questions: 1) What are the components of software development risk? 2) how does risk management mitigate risk components, and 3) what environmental factors if any influence them? Using principal component analysis we identify six software risk components: 1) scheduling and timing risks, 2) functionality risks, 3) subcontracting risks, 4) requirements management, 5) resource usage and performance risks, and 6) personnel management risks. By using one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons we examine how risk management (or the lack of it) and environmental factors (such as development methods, manager's experience) influence each risk component. The analysis shows that awareness of the importance of risk management and systematic practices to manage risks have an effect on scheduling risks, requirements management risks, and personnel management risks. Environmental contingencies were observed to affect all risk components. This suggests that software risks can be best managed by combining specific risk management considerations with a detailed understanding of the environmental context and with sound managerial practices, such as relying on experienced and well-educated project managers and launching correctly sized projects.","1939-3520","","10.1109/32.841112","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=841112","","Programming;Risk management;Environmental management;Project management;Environmental factors;Personnel;Analysis of variance;Instruments;Principal component analysis;Software performance","risk management;software development management;principal component analysis","software development risk management;project manager survey;environmental factors;principal component analysis;timing risks;scheduling risks;functionality risks;subcontracting risks;requirements management;resource usage;performance risks;personnel management risks;one-way ANOVA;multiple comparisons;environmental contingencies","","191","","48","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The BCI presents the user with a matrix of 6 by 6 cells, each containing one letter of the alphabet. The user focuses attention on the cell containing the letter to be communicated while the rows and the columns of the matrix are intensified. Each intensification is an event in the oddball sequence, the row and the column containing the attended cell are ""rare"" items and, therefore, only these events elicit a P300. The computer thus detects the transmitted character by determining which row and which column elicited the P300. The authors report an assessment, using a bootstrapping approach, which indicates that an off line version of the system can communicate at the rate of 7.8 characters a minute and achieve 80% accuracy. The system's performance in real time was also assessed. The authors' data indicate that a P300-based BCI is feasible and practical. However, these conclusions are based on tests using healthy individuals.","1558-0024","","10.1109/86.847808","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=847808","","Prosthetics;Brain computer interfaces;Enterprise resource planning;Electroencephalography;Real time systems;Testing;Biological control systems;Research initiatives;Collaborative work;Psychology","visual evoked potentials;medical computing;prosthetics;electroencephalography","mental prosthesis;P300-based brain-computer interface speed assessment;rare events;oddball sequence;transmitted character;bootstrapping approach;healthy individuals;alphabet;letter","","728","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The scaling of the CMOS channel length to below 0.5 /spl mu/m and increase of the chip density to the ULSI range have placed power dissipation on an equal footing with performance as a figure of merit in digital circuit design. Portability and reliability have also played a major role in the emergence of low-power, low-voltage, digital circuit designs. The need to extend the battery life, to have inexpensive packaging and cooling systems, and to reduce the weight and size of the equipment were the driving forces in this regard. Reducing the power dissipation of arithmetic operations while keeping the performance unaffected, is indispensable for digital signal processing (DSP), reduced instruction set computers (RISCs), microprocessors, etc. In this presentation, several novel high performance digital circuit designs that emphasize low-power and low-voltage operation are introduced. These circuits utilize a wide range of techniques that are used in state-of-the-art VLSI systems and hence serve as good examples for low-power design. In addition, important features of submicron VLSI technologies that support low-power operation of digital systems are discussed.","","964-360-057-2","10.1109/ICM.2000.916401","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=916401","","Very large scale integration;Circuit synthesis;Digital circuits;Power dissipation;Digital signal processing;CMOS digital integrated circuits;Ultra large scale integration;Power system reliability;Batteries;Packaging machines","VLSI;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit packaging;CMOS digital integrated circuits;digital signal processing chips;reduced instruction set computing;microprocessor chips;cooling;thermal management (packaging);digital arithmetic;integrated circuit reliability;low-power electronics","low power VLSI CMOS circuit design;CMOS channel length scaling;chip density;ULSI range;power dissipation;figure of merit;digital circuit design;portability;reliability;low-power low-voltage digital circuit design;battery life;packaging;cooling systems;equipment weight;equipment size;arithmetic operations;IC performance;digital signal processing;DSP;reduced instruction set computers;RISCs;microprocessors;low-voltage operation;low-power operation;VLSI systems;low-power design;digital systems","","1","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We present a probabilistic approach for the coordination of multiple robots which, in contrast to previous approaches, simultaneously takes into account the costs of reaching a target point and the utility of target points. The utility of target points is given by the size of the unexplored area that a robot can cover with its sensors upon reaching a target position. Whenever a target point is assigned to a specific robot, the utility of the unexplored area visible from this target position is reduced for the other robots. This way, a team of multiple robots assigns different target points to the individual robots. The technique has been implemented and tested extensively in real-world experiments and simulation runs. The results given in this paper demonstrate that our coordination technique significantly reduces the exploration time compared to previous approaches.","1050-4729","0-7803-5886-4","10.1109/ROBOT.2000.844100","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=844100","","Collaboration;Robot kinematics;Robot sensing systems;Computer science;Costs;Mobile robots;Multirobot systems;Testing;Traveling salesman problems;Redundancy","multi-robot systems;mobile robots;cooperative systems;minimisation;probability","collaborative multirobot exploration;overall exploration time minimization;probabilistic approach;multiple robot coordination;target point utility","","309","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, Fourier analysis provided a poor representation of signals well localized in time. In this case, it is difficult to detect and identify the signal pattern from the expansion coefficients because the information is diluted across the whole basis. The wavelet packet transform (WPT) is introduced as an alternative means of extracting time-frequency information from vibration signatures. The resulting WPT coefficients provide one with arbitrary time-frequency resolution of a signal. With the aid of statistical-based feature selection criteria, many of the feature components containing little discriminant information could be discarded, resulting in a feature subset having a reduced number of parameters without compromising the classification performance. The extracted reduced dimensional feature vector is then used as input to a neural network classifier. This significantly reduces the long training time that is often associated with the neural network classifier and improves its generalization capability.","1557-9948","","10.1109/41.847906","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=847906","","Wavelet packets;Feature extraction;Signal analysis;Data mining;Time frequency analysis;Neural networks;Condition monitoring;Time domain analysis;Frequency domain analysis;Signal processing","condition monitoring;vibration measurement;wavelet transforms;feature extraction;signal classification;fault diagnosis;time-frequency analysis","vibration monitoring;wavelet packet feature extraction;dynamic systems condition monitoring;vibration signatures;Fourier-based analysis;expansion coefficients;wavelet packet transform;time-frequency information extraction;time-frequency resolution;feature subset;classification performance;extracted reduced dimensional feature vector;neural network classifier;training time;generalization capability","","316","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This algorithm models a tracking problem by determining the state of each pixel in an image and its transit, and how such states transit along both the x-y image axes as well as the time axes. Our algorithm is sufficiently robust to segment and track occluded vehicles at a high success rate of 93%-96%. This success has led to the development of an extendable robust event recognition system based on the hidden Markov model (HMM). The system learns various event behavior patterns of each vehicle in the HMM chains and then, using the output from the tracking system, identifies current event chains. The current system can recognize bumping, passing, and jamming. However, by including other event patterns in the training set, the system can be extended to recognize those other events, e.g., illegal U-turns or reckless driving. We have implemented this system, evaluated it using the tracking results, and demonstrated its effectiveness.","1558-0016","","10.1109/6979.880968","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=880968","","Monitoring;Road accidents;Hidden Markov models;Traffic control;Robustness;Vehicles;Markov random fields;Pixel;Image segmentation;Jamming","road traffic;accidents;computerised monitoring;computer vision;optical tracking;hidden Markov models;feature extraction;learning systems","traffic monitoring;accident detection;intersections;road traffic;hidden Markov model;Markov random field;learning system;tracking;computer vision;feature extraction","","309","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In contrast to the deterministic case, we allow the control and state weighting matrices in the cost functional to be indefinite. This leads to an indefinite LQ problem, which may still be well posed due to the deep nature of uncertainty involved. The problem gives rise to a stochastic algebraic Riccati equation (SARE), which is, however, fundamentally different from the classical algebraic Riccati equation as a result of the indefinite nature of the LQ problem. To analyze the SARE, we introduce linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) whose feasibility is shown to be equivalent to the solvability of the SARE. Moreover, we develop a computational approach to the SARE via a semi-definite programming associated with the LMIs.

The choice of population size and mutation rate can cause the run time of the GA to vary by several orders of magnitude. The results of this investigation show that a small population size and relatively large mutation rate is far superior to the large population sizes and low mutation rates that is used by most of the papers presented in the electromagnetics community and by the GA community at large.

Hochschule Darmstadt, Germany; NA","IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","","2000","47","5","1015","1020","In comparison to classical DC motors, brushless DC motors are very reliable, Nevertheless, they can also fail, caused by, e.g., overheating or mechanical wear. This paper proposes a parameter estimation technique for fault detection on this type of motor. Simply by measuring the motor's input and output signals, its parameters can be estimated. This method is based on a mathematical model of the process. In the presented work, a square-wave motor is considered. An appropriate model is derived. To be able to implement the method also on low-cost microcontroller-based control units, only the power inverter supply voltage, DC current, and the motor's angular velocity have to be measured. The parameter estimation technique provides information about the electrical resistance and the back-EMF constant as well as about the mechanical parameters.

The hybrid filter consists of a small-rated active filter and a 5th-tuned passive filter. The active filter is characterized by detecting the 5th-harmonic current flowing into the passive filter. It is controlled in such a way as to behave as a negative or positive resistor by adjusting a feedback gain from a negative to positive value, and vice versa. The negative resistor presented by the active filter cancels a positive resistor inherent in the passive filter, so that the hybrid filter acts as an ideal passive filter with infinite quality factor. This significantly improves damping the harmonic resonance, compared with the passive filter used alone. Moreover, the active filter acts as a positive resistor to prevent an excessive harmonic current from flowing into the passive filter. Experimental results obtained from a 20-kW laboratory model verify the viability and effectiveness of the hybrid active filter proposed in this paper.","1941-0107","","10.1109/63.838093","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=838093","","Active filters;Damping;Power harmonic filters;Resonance;Passive filters;Power system harmonics;Resistors;Industrial power systems;Negative feedback;Q factor","industrial power systems;power system harmonics;power harmonic filters;harmonic distortion;circuit feedback;power supply quality","industrial power systems;harmonic resonance damping;hybrid active filter;small-rated active filter;5th harmonic-tuned passive filter;positive resistor;negative resistor;feedback gain;infinite quality factor;harmonic current;20 kW","","148","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For time-domain calculations the real equivalent, 0, /spl alpha/, /spl beta/, is preferred, usually extended to 0, d, q-components. In network calculations, however, the application of time-dependent symmetrical components makes sense, since many net-component parameters are already available in this form. In this paper a short historical overview of the symmetrical-component transformation and the application of unitary and orthogonal transformations are presented. From these general transformations logic choices for base quantities necessary in per unit calculations are derived.

The purpose of this paper is to review and present new insight into seven important considerations for the design of active piezoelectric polymer ultrasound transducers: piezoelectric polymer materials selection, transducer construction and packaging requirements, materials characterization and modeling, film thickness and active area design, electroding selection, backing material design, and front protection/matching layer design. Besides reviewing these design considerations, this paper also presents new insight into the design of active piezoelectric polymer ultrasonic transducers. The design and fabrication of an immersible ultrasonic transducer, which has no adhesive layer between the active element and backing layer, is included. The transducer features direct deposition of poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF-TrFE)] copolymer onto an insulated aluminum backing substrate. Pulse-echo tests indicated a minimum insertion loss of 37 dB and -6 dB bandwidth of 9.8 to 22 MHz (71%). The use of polymer wear-protection/quarter-wave matching layers is also discussed. Test results on a P(VDF-TrFE) transducer showed that a Mylar/sup TM/ front layer provided a slight increase in pulse-echo amplitude of 15% (or 1.2 dB) and an increase in -6 dB pulse-echo fractional bandwidth from 86 to 95%. Theoretical derivations are reported for optimizing the active area of the piezoelectric polymer element for maximum power transfer at resonance. These derivations are extended to the special case for a low profile (i.e., thin) shielded transducer. A method for modeling the non-linear loading effects of a commercial pulser-receiver is also included.","1525-8955","","10.1109/58.883527","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=883527","","Ultrasonic imaging;Piezoelectric transducers;Ultrasonic transducers;Polymer films;Building materials;Piezoelectric materials;Testing;Bandwidth;Ceramics;Mechanical factors","ultrasonic transducers;piezoelectric materials;polymers;packaging;losses;modelling;reviews","design considerations;piezoelectric polymer ultrasound transducers;review;materials selection;transducer construction;packaging;materials characterization;modeling;film thickness;active area design;electroding selection;backing material design;front protection/matching layer design;fabrication;immersible ultrasonic transducer;direct deposition;poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene);P(VDF-TrFE) copolymer;insulated aluminum backing substrate;pulse-echo tests;minimum insertion loss;polymer wear-protection/quarter-wave matching layers;Mylar;pulse-echo amplitude;pulse-echo fractional bandwidth;maximum power transfer;low profile shielded transducer;nonlinear loading effects;pulser-receiver","","101","","101","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Partial encryption of compressed images and videos","H. Cheng; Xiaobo Li","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Alberta Univ., Edmonton, Alta., Canada; NA","IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","","2000","48","8","2439","2451","The increased popularity of multimedia applications places a great demand on efficient data storage and transmission techniques. Network communication, especially over a wireless network, can easily be intercepted and must be protected from eavesdroppers. Unfortunately, encryption and decryption are slow, and it is often difficult, if not impossible, to carry out real-time secure image and video communication and processing. Methods have been proposed to combine compression and encryption together to reduce the overall processing time, but they are either insecure or too computationally intensive. We propose a novel solution called partial encryption, in which a secure encryption algorithm is used to encrypt only part of the compressed data. Partial encryption is applied to several image and video compression algorithms in this paper.

Transition between these two regimes is accomplished without a switching function. The model incorporates a hysteresis function with nonlocal memory and arbitrary transition curves. These last aspects prove essential for modeling presliding friction that is encountered in real physical situations. The model as a whole can also handle the Stribeck effect and stick-slip behavior as has been demonstrated by validation on a KUKA IR 361 robot. In this sense, this model can be considered as more complete in comparison with others found in the literature. The general friction model allows modeling of individual friction systems through the identification of a set of parameters that determine the complete behavior of the system. In this way, the model structure has been used to identify the friction behavior of a linear slide as well as that of the above mentioned KUKA robot. The results of the latter identification have been consequently used for feedforward friction compensation to obtain the most accurate tracking.","1558-2523","","10.1109/9.847103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=847103","","Friction;Surface topography;Control systems;Velocity control;Lubricants;Predictive models;Surface texture;Hysteresis;Robot sensing systems;Mechatronics","friction;hysteresis;feedforward;compensation;motion control;nonlinear control systems;robots","integrated friction model structure;presliding behavior;accurate friction compensation;dynamical friction model structure;hysteresis function;nonlocal memory;arbitrary transition curves;Stribeck effect;stick-slip behavior;KUKA IR 361 robot;linear slide;feedforward friction compensation","","388","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The problems subsequent to its use in real-time operations are then set out so as to motivate the idea of synthesizing it by a recursive distribution of zeros and poles. An analysis of the existing work is also proposed to support this idea. A comprehensive study is given of the synthesis of differentiators with integer, noninteger, real or complex orders, and whose action is limited to any given frequency bandwidth. First, a definition, in the operational and frequency domains, of a frequency-band complex noninteger order differentiator, is given in a mathematical space with four dimensions which is a Banach algebra. Then, the determination of its synthesized form, by a recursive distribution of complex zeros and poles characterized by complex recursive factors, is presented. The complex noninteger differentiation order is expressed as a function of these recursive factors. The number of zeros and poles is calculated to be as low as possible while still ensuring the stability of the synthesized differentiator to be synthesized. A time validation is presented. Finally, guidelines are proposed for the conception of the synthesized differentiator.","1558-1268","","10.1109/81.817385","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=817385","","Frequency synthesizers;Poles and zeros;Physics;Voltage;Levee;Robust control;Robust stability;Fractals;Equations;Oscillators","differentiating circuits;real-time systems;Banach spaces;circuit stability;poles and zeros;network synthesis","frequency-band complex noninteger differentiator;real-time operations;recursive distribution;frequency bandwidth;Banach algebra;complex recursive factors;stability;time validation","","846","","48","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although it is possible in this way to find a three-dimensional (3D) surface representation, the distribution of the different scatterers in the height direction at a fixed range and azimuth position remains unknown. Contrary to this, tomographic techniques enable a real geometric resolution capability in the height direction and introduce new possibilities for many applications and inversion problems. Even misinterpretations in SAR images caused by layover and foreshortening effects can be solved by the tomographic processing. In this paper, the successful experimental realization of polarimetric airborne SAR tomography is demonstrated for the first time. The authors present the concept of aperture synthesis for tomographic imaging for the case of a multibaseline imaging geometry and discuss the constraints arising from the limited number of flight tracks. They propose a method for reduction of the height ambiguities associated to the irregular and undersampled spatial distribution of the imaging positions.

Optics could solve many physical problems of interconnects, including precise clock distribution, system synchronization (allowing larger synchronous zones, both on-chip and between chips), bandwidth and density of long interconnections, and reduction of power dissipation. Optics may relieve a broad range of design problems, such as crosstalk, voltage isolation, wave reflection, impedence matching, and pin inductance. It may allow continued scaling of existing architectures and enable novel highly interconnected or high-bandwidth architectures. No physical breakthrough is required to implement dense optical interconnects to silicon chips, though substantial technological work remains. Cost is a significant barrier to practical introduction, though revolutionary approaches exist that might achieve economies of scale. An Appendix analyzes scaling of on-chop global electrical interconnects, including line inductance and the skin effect, both of which impose significant additional constraints on future interconnects.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.867687","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=867687","","Optical interconnections;Optical crosstalk;Silicon;Isolation technology;Power system interconnection;Inductance;Integrated optics;CMOS technology;Clocks;Synchronization","optical interconnections;CMOS integrated circuits","optical interconnects;silicon CMOS chips","","741","","137","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The approach brings some improvement in the calculations of self-inductance of thin-wall solenoids and disk coils that can be encountered in superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) problems. We also give a method for the calculation of mutual inductance of disk coils and of thin-wall solenoids. The results are obtained in an analytical form over the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind and Heuman's Lambda function. It is important to mention that the kernels of these integrals are always continuous functions on intervals of integration, so singularities are avoided. The results enable one to calculate the self-inductance and the mutual inductance of any thin air-core coil precisely and fast.

The resulting low quality images greatly limit what vision can accomplish today. This paper proposes a very simple method for significantly enhancing the dynamic range of virtually any imaging system. The basic principle is to simultaneously sample the spatial and exposure dimensions of image irradiance. One of several ways to achieve this is by placing an optical mask adjacent to a conventional image detector array. The mask has a pattern with spatially varying transmittance, thereby giving adjacent pixels on the detector different exposures to the scene. The captured image is mapped to a high dynamic range image using an efficient image reconstruction algorithm. The end result is an imaging system that can measure a very wide range of scene radiance and produce a substantially larger number of brightness levels, with a slight reduction in spatial resolution. We conclude with several examples of high dynamic range images computed using spatially varying pixel exposures.","1063-6919","0-7695-0662-3","10.1109/CVPR.2000.855857","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=855857","","Dynamic range;Pixel;Optical imaging;Layout;Brightness;Detectors;Optical arrays;Machine vision;Sensor arrays;Image reconstruction","image reconstruction;computer vision","high dynamic range imaging;spatially varying pixel exposures;real scenes;brightness variations;vision systems;low dynamic range image detectors;brightness data;low quality images;imaging system;image detector array;dynamic range image;image reconstruction algorithm;brightness;spatial resolution;dynamic range images","","181","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It does not need any matched components to reach high CMRR and its bandwidth is not gain-bandwidth product limited. However, improving the CMRR of this amplifier is not as straightforward as with voltage-mode topologies. Therefore, in this paper the matrix representation of the current conveyor is extended to include all linear nonidealities and based on this an enhanced current-conveyor macromodel is derived. Using this model the common-mode behavior of the current-mode instrumentation is discussed in detail. Furthermore, different CMRR enhancement techniques of current-mode instrumentation amplifiers are discussed and compared. As an example, a new current-mode instrumentation amplifier topology is realized with AD844 current-feedback operational amplifiers. The new instrumentation amplifier provides approximately 40 dB of improvement on the high-frequency CMRR up to the -3-dB corner frequency and even higher, without any matched components.

Beth","Inst. fur Algorithmen und Kognitive Syst., Karlsruhe Univ., Germany","2000 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","","2000","1","","735","736 vol.1","Summary form only given, as follows. Gives a system theoretic approach to the concept of quantum computing. A quantum computer is envisaged to be a system of quantum circuits, acting on a state space, which is a finite-say 2/sup n/-dimensional-complex Hilbert space. The circuitry is a sequence of unitary transforms U/sub t/ /spl epsiv/ SU(2/sup n/) followed by a measurement. These transforms, so-called quantum gates, are controlled by a classical computer, usually especially electromagnetic fields. The state space of a quantum computer has the structure of a Hermitian vector space. Thus it allows ""simultaneous"" superposition of orthogonal basis states (corresponding to classical states) with the possibility of constructive and destructive interference between different paths of computation. This principle allows the usage of so-called entangled states by preparing the superposition of special ""bent"" configurations of basis vectors in the product Hilbert space, e.g., as they are known from error control and cryptography. This latter ""entanglement"" not only promises to make a quantum computer much more powerful than a probabilistic one, but it also allows a method of parallelism. The reason for this lies not only in the fact that the 2/sup n/ dimensional Hilbert space is the n-fold tensor product of 2-dimensional spaces as it is given by spin-1/2-particles, like photons, representing a quantum bit. First of all, we shall address the fact that the power of quantum computing lies in the properties of entangled states as opposed to those of separable states which essentially would resemble classical circuits without giving the feature of exponential speed-up. We shall briefly describe possible physical realisations of quantum (optic, electronic, magnetic,...) devices allowing the engineering of Hamiltonians needed for quantum systems. Basic quantum gates, especially the quantum Horner-Toffoli gate will be discussed to display the principles and methodology for designing quantum circuits. An outlook towards the possible availability of nano- and mesoscopic technologies supporting this new architecture in future generations concludes based on a speculative worst/best case forecast of possible applications, e.g., in public key and conventional cryptography.","","0-7803-5482-6","10.1109/ISCAS.2000.857200","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=857200","","Quantum computing;Circuits;Hilbert space;Quantum entanglement;State-space methods;Public key cryptography;Optical devices;Quantum mechanics;Magnetic field measurement;Electromagnetic measurements","quantum computing;Hilbert spaces;Hermitian matrices;mesoscopic systems;nanotechnology","system theoretic approach;quantum computing;state space;complex Hilbert space;unitary transforms;quantum gates;Hermitian vector space;orthogonal basis states;entangled states;n-fold tensor product;Hamiltonians;quantum Horner-Toffoli gate;mesoscopic technologies;nanotechnologies;public key cryptography","","2","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In fully integrated PLLs, the VCO output frequency should be tunable over a wide range of frequencies, covering the desired range of the synthesizer output frequencies, for all processing variations and operating conditions. A wide tuning range realized by making the VCO gain K/sub o/ large has the unwanted effect of increasing the phase noise at the output of the VCO, and hence the PLL as well. In this work, the wide tuning range is realized by digital control, with process variability managed through self-calibration. The PLL is only required to pull the oscillator output frequency to account for the digital quantization, temperature variations, and some margin. This allows the K/sub o/ to be small, with better noise performance resulting. The prototype self-calibrating frequency synthesizer, capable of operating from 80 MHz to 1 GHz, demonstrates a measured absolute jitter of 20-ps rms at 480-MHz operating frequency.

A new stability criterion, which reduces artificial conservativeness and is also insensitive to component grouping is described. In addition, a means of readily establishing design specifications from an arbitrary stability criterion which specifically includes a provision to incorporate uncertainty, parameter variation, and nonlinearities is set forth.

They tested a range of basic software engineering hypotheses relating to: the Pareto principle of distribution of faults and failures; the use of early fault data to predict later fault and failure data; metrics for fault prediction; and benchmarking fault data. For example, we found strong evidence that a small number of modules contain most of the faults discovered in prerelease testing and that a very small number of modules contain most of the faults discovered in operation. We found no evidence to support previous claims relating module size to fault density nor did we find evidence that popular complexity metrics are good predictors of either fault-prone or failure-prone modules. We confirmed that the number of faults discovered in prerelease testing is an order of magnitude greater than the number discovered in 12 months of operational use. The most important result was strong evidence of a counter-intuitive relationship between pre- and postrelease faults; those modules which are the most fault-prone prerelease are among the least fault-prone postrelease, while conversely, the modules which are most fault-prone postrelease are among the least fault-prone prerelease. This observation has serious ramifications for the commonly used fault density measure.

As an example, the system's control-loops are difficult to design without an accurate small-signal model; at the same time, the system protection design requires large-signal transient modeling. A particularity of the described system is strong nonideal operation of the diode rectifier, a consequence of the large value of the generator's synchronous impedance. This nonideal behavior influences both steady-state and transient performance. This paper presents an average model of the system that accounts, in a detailed manner for the dynamics of the power source and the load, and for the effects of the nonideal operation of the diode rectifier. The model is nonlinear, but time-continuous, and can be used for large- and small-signal analysis. The developed model was verified on a 105 kW generator-set with inverter output, whose DC-link voltage control-loop design was successfully carried out based on the average model. It is shown that a high bandwidth is needed for this control-loop in order to achieve the proper impedance matching between the power source and the active electronic load.","1941-0107","","10.1109/63.838103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=838103","","Synchronous generators;Diodes;Rectifiers;Power system modeling;Inverters;Frequency;Control system synthesis;Protection;Impedance;Steady-state","variable speed gear;synchronous generators;load (electric);machine control;machine theory;control system synthesis;AC-DC power convertors;rectifying circuits;invertors;DC-AC power convertors;control system analysis;closed loop systems;voltage control","variable-speed synchronous generator;active DC load;inverter;three-phase diode rectifier;time-domain;frequency-domain;small-signal model;large-signal transient modelling;synchronous impedance;nonideal behavior;steady-state performance;transient performance;DC-link voltage control-loop design;impedance matching;generator modelling;generator control","","111","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes a new technology, which utilizes the duty cycle signal, to improve light load efficiency with simple implementation. Since current sensors are not required, high density and high efficiency can be achieved that makes the whole circuit suitable for integration. In the paper, two application examples are given.

However, there is a limitation of this approach imposed by its information representation model and the computation methods used when fusion processes are performed on linguistic values. This limitation is the loss of information; this loss of information implies a lack of precision in the final results from the fusion of linguistic information. In this paper, we present tools for overcoming this limitation. The linguistic information is expressed by means of 2-tuples, which are composed of a linguistic term and a numeric value assessed in (-0.5, 0.5). This model allows a continuous representation of the linguistic information on its domain, therefore, it can represent any counting of information obtained in a aggregation process. We then develop a computational technique for computing with words without any loss of information. Finally, different classical aggregation operators are extended to deal with the 2-tuple linguistic model.","1941-0034","","10.1109/91.890332","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=890332","","Information representation;Computational modeling;Decision making","computational linguistics;fuzzy set theory","fuzzy linguistic representation model;computing with words;information representation;information fusion;linguistic modeling","","1300","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Rule generation from artificial neural networks is gaining in popularity in recent times due to its capability of providing some insight to the user about the symbolic knowledge embedded within the network. Fuzzy sets are an aid in providing this information in a more human comprehensible or natural form, and can handle uncertainties at various levels. The neuro-fuzzy approach, symbiotically combining the merits of connectionist and fuzzy approaches, constitutes a key component of soft computing at this stage. To date, there has been no detailed and integrated categorization of the various neuro-fuzzy models used for rule generation. We propose to bring these together under a unified soft computing framework. Moreover, we include both rule extraction and rule refinement in the broader perspective of rule generation. Rules learned and generated for fuzzy reasoning and fuzzy control are also considered from this wider viewpoint. Models are grouped on the basis of their level of neuro-fuzzy synthesis. Use of other soft computing tools like genetic algorithms and rough sets are emphasized. Rule generation from fuzzy knowledge-based networks, which initially encode some crude domain knowledge, are found to result in more refined rules. Finally, real-life application to medical diagnosis is provided.","1941-0093","","10.1109/72.846746","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=846746","","Artificial neural networks;Fuzzy sets;Humans;Uncertainty;Symbiosis;Fuzzy reasoning;Fuzzy control;Network synthesis;Genetic algorithms;Rough sets","fuzzy neural nets;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);genetic algorithms;rough set theory","neuro-fuzzy rule generation;soft computing framework;artificial neural networks;symbolic knowledge;fuzzy sets;rule extraction;rule refinement;genetic algorithms;GA;rough sets;fuzzy knowledge-based networks;medical diagnosis","","455","","149","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The paper summarizes our preliminary investigations into the evolution of the best known open source system: the Linux operating system kernel. Because Linux is large (over two million lines of code in the most recent version) and because its development model is not as tightly planned and managed as most industrial software processes, we had expected to find that Linux was growing more slowly as it got bigger and more complex. Instead, we have found that Linux has been growing at a super-linear rate for several years. The authors explore the evolution of the Linux kernel both at the system level and within the major subsystems, and they discuss why they think Linux continues to exhibit such strong growth.","1063-6773","0-7695-0753-0","10.1109/ICSM.2000.883030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=883030","","Software prototyping","software prototyping;software maintenance;Unix;operating system kernels","open source software;case study;software evolution;large software systems;evolutionary narratives;commercially developed systems;Linux operating system kernel;development model","","220","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Corp., Cambridge, MA, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","","2000","9","3","497","501","In this paper, we propose an efficient, robust, and fast method for the estimation of global motion from image sequences. The method is generic in that it can accommodate various global motion models, from a simple translation to an eight-parameter perspective model. The algorithm is hierarchical and consists of three stages. In the first stage, a low-pass image pyramid is built. Then, an initial translation is estimated with full-pixel precision at the top of the pyramid using a modified n-step search matching. In the third stage, a gradient descent is executed at each level of the pyramid starting from the initial translation at the coarsest level. Due to the coarse initial estimation and the hierarchical implementation, the method is very fast. To increase robustness to outliers, we replace the usual formulation based on a quadratic error criterion with a truncated quadratic function. We have applied the algorithm to various test sequences within an MPEG-4 coding system. From the experimental results we conclude that global motion estimation provides significant performance gains for video material with camera zoom and/or pan. The gains result from a reduced prediction error and a more compact representation of motion. We also conclude that the robust error criterion can introduce additional performance gains without increasing computational complexity.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.826785","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=826785","","Robustness;Motion estimation;Video coding;Motion compensation;MPEG 4 Standard;Cameras;Video compression;Performance gain;Sprites (computer);Redundancy","video coding;motion estimation;image sequences","global motion estimation;video coding;image sequences;eight-parameter perspective model;hierarchical algorithm;low-pass image pyramid;full-pixel precision;modified n-step search matching;gradient descent;initial translation;coarse initial estimation;robustness;truncated quadratic function;MPEG-4 coding system;performance gains;reduced prediction error;robust error criterion","","229","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A modified theory of planned behavior (TPB) is used to hypothesize a model of e-commerce service acceptance, which is then tested using a field survey of 172 e-brokerage users. We found TPB was useful in explaining e-commerce service acceptance, however, acceptance motivations were significantly different from that of typical IS products. Based on a broader conceptualization of TPB's subjective norm to include both external (mass-media) and interpersonal influences, we report that subjective norm is an important predictor of e-commerce acceptance, behavioral control has minimal impact on e-commerce acceptance, and external influence is a significant determinant of subjective norm. Implications of these findings in light of e-commerce research and practice are discussed.","1558-2426","","10.1109/3468.852435","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=852435","","Computer aided software engineering;Humans;Electronic commerce;Testing;Web and internet services;Procurement;Management information systems;Banking;Consumer electronics","electronic commerce;human factors;behavioural sciences;management science","electronic brokerages;e-commerce;electronic commerce;planned behavior theory;service acceptance;acceptance motivations;information systems","","284","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

MJ trajectories are desirable for their similarity to human joint movements and for their amenability to path tracking and to limit robot vibrations. This makes them attractive choices for robotic applications, in spite of the fact that the manipulator dynamics are not taken into account. Cubic splines are used in a framework that assures overall continuity of velocities and accelerations in the robot movement. The resulting MJ trajectory planning is shown to be a global constrained minimax optimization problem. This is solved by a newly devised algorithm based on interval analysis and proof of convergence with certainty to an arbitrarily good global solution is provided. The proposed planning method is applied to an example regarding a six-joint manipulator and comparisons with an alternative MJ planner are exposed.","1557-9948","","10.1109/41.824136","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=824136","","Trajectory;Robots;Orbital robotics;Manipulator dynamics;Humans;Tracking;Acceleration;Minimax techniques;Constraint optimization;Algorithm design and analysis","manipulators;position control;path planning;control system synthesis;optimal control;vibration control;splines (mathematics);minimax techniques","robot manipulators;global minimum-jerk trajectory planning;control design;interval analysis;joint space scheme;cubic splines;path tracking;robot vibrations limitation;global constrained minimax optimization problem;six-joint manipulator","","188","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation. Symposia Proceedings (Cat. No.00CH37065)","","2000","1","","521","528 vol.1","Describes an approach to probabilistic roadmap planners (PRMs). The overall theme of the algorithm, called Lazy PRM, is to minimize the number of collision checks performed during planning and hence minimize the running time of the planner. Our algorithm builds a roadmap in the configuration space, whose nodes are the user-defined initial and goal configurations and a number of randomly generated nodes. Neighboring nodes are connected by edges representing paths between the nodes. In contrast with PRMs, our planner initially assumes that all nodes and edges in the roadmap are collision-free, and searches the roadmap at hand for a shortest path between the initial and the goal node. The nodes and edges along the path are then checked for collision. If a collision with the obstacles occurs, the corresponding nodes and edges are removed from the roadmap. Our planner either finds a new shortest path, or first updates the roadmap with new nodes and edges, and then searches for a shortest path. The above process is repeated until a collision-free path is returned. Lazy PRM is tailored to efficiently answer single planning queries, but can also be used for multiple queries. Experimental results presented in the paper show that our lazy method is very efficient in practice.","1050-4729","0-7803-5886-4","10.1109/ROBOT.2000.844107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=844107","","Path planning;Road accidents;Orbital robotics;Mathematics;Random number generation;Joining processes;Manufacturing automation;Manufacturing processes;Mobile robots;Animation","collision avoidance;robots;probability","lazy PRM;probabilistic roadmap planners;collision checks;user-defined configurations;randomly generated nodes;shortest path;collision-free path;single planning queries","","336","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Eng., Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN, USA; NA; NA; NA","IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","","2000","5","1","79","91","High-performance robust motion control of single-rod hydraulic actuators with constant unknown inertia load is considered. The two chambers of a single-rod actuator have different areas, so the dynamic equations describing the pressure changes in them cannot be combined into a single load pressure equation. This complicates controller design since it not only increases the system dimension but also brings in the stability issue of the added internal dynamics. A discontinuous projection-based adaptive robust controller (ARC) is constructed. The controller takes into account not only the effect of parameter variations coming from the inertia load and various hydraulic parameters but also the effect of hard-to-model nonlinearities such as uncompensated friction forces and external disturbances. It guarantees a prescribed output tracking transient performance and final tracking accuracy in general while achieving asymptotic output tracking in the presence of parametric uncertainties. In addition, the zero error dynamics for tracking any nonzero constant velocity trajectory is shown to be globally uniformly stable. Experimental results are obtained for the swing motion control of a hydraulic arm and verify the high-performance nature of the proposed strategy. In comparison to a state-of-the-art industrial motion controller, the proposed algorithm achieves more than a magnitude reduction of tracking errors. Furthermore, during the constant velocity portion of the motion, it reduces the tracking errors almost down to the measurement resolution level.","1941-014X","","10.1109/3516.828592","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=828592","","Programmable control;Adaptive control;Robust control;Motion control;Hydraulic actuators;Differential equations;Tracking;Control systems;Stability;Nonlinear dynamical systems","hydraulic control equipment;actuators;adaptive control;robust control;uncertain systems;dynamics;control system synthesis;control nonlinearities","adaptive robust motion control;single-rod hydraulic actuators;constant unknown inertia load;dynamic equations;controller design;added internal dynamics;discontinuous projection-based adaptive robust controller;ARC;parameter variations;inertia load;hydraulic parameters;nonlinearities;uncompensated friction forces;external disturbances;output tracking transient performance;asymptotic output tracking;zero error dynamics;nonzero constant velocity trajectory tracking;global uniform stability;swing motion control;hydraulic arm;tracking errors","","357","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Optimal operating conditions for minimum input power requirement and maximum efficiency operations are identified. Coreless PCB transformers have the advantages of low costs, very high power density, no limitation due to magnetic cores, no magnetic loss and ease of manufacturing. They have the potential to be developed in microcircuits. A printed planar PCB transformer with a diameter of about 1.0 cm and power capability of 19 W has been successfully tested. The power density of the PCB transformer demonstrated in this paper is 24 W/cm/sup 2/. The maximum efficiency can be greater than 90%. The analysis has been confirmed with experiments.

Thus, to allow similar scan ranges for both bands, the L-band elements are selected as perforated patches to enable the placement of C-band elements within them. Stacked-patch configurations were used to meet the bandwidth requirements, especially in the L-band. The C-band element was designed numerically, but the perforated L-band one required final experimental optimization. Also, in the latter case of L-band, a balanced transmission line feed was used to minimize cross polarization. For the C-band elements, slot coupling was used and, to simplify the feed, symmetric parasitic slots were incorporated to minimize cross polarization. No vertical connections were utilized, and electromagnetic couplings resulted in a compact low-profile design, with an electrically and thermally symmetric geometry.","1558-2221","","10.1109/8.827386","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=827386","","Microstrip antennas;Dual band;L-band;Frequency;Feeds;Electromagnetic wave polarization;Synthetic aperture radar;Microstrip antenna arrays;Bandwidth;Design optimization","synthetic aperture radar;microstrip antenna arrays;radar antennas;UHF antennas;antenna feeds;electromagnetic wave polarisation;multifrequency antennas;antenna radiation patterns;electromagnetic coupling","dual-band dual-polarized perforated microstrip antennas;SAR applications;low-profile design;operating frequencies;C-band;array elements;inter-element separations;scan range;L-band;perforated patches;stacked-patch configurations;bandwidth;experimental optimization;balanced transmission line feed;cross polarization;slot coupling;symmetric parasitic slot;vertical connections;electromagnetic couplings;electrically symmetric geometry;thermally symmetric geometry;UHF;SHF;5.3 GHz;1.275 GHz","","97","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Odometry and sonar signals are fused using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Adaptive Fuzzy Logic System (AFLS). The signals used during navigation cannot be always considered as white noise signals. On the other hand, colored signals will cause the EKF to diverge. The AFLS was used to adapt the gain and therefore prevent Kalman filter divergence. The fused signal is more accurate than any of the original signals considered separately.

Delay lines and resonators have been used, and two principles have been employed: SAW one-port devices that are directly affected by the measurand and SAW two-port devices that are electrically loaded by a conventional sensor and, therefore, indirectly affected by the measurand. For radio frequency (RF) interrogation, time domain sampling (TDS) and frequency domain sampling (FDS) have been investigated theoretically and experimentally; the methods of measurement are described.

Since the psychovisual effects of frequency distortion and noise injection are independent, we decouple these two sources of degradation and measure their effect on the human visual system. We develop a distortion measure (DM) of the effect of frequency distortion, and a noise quality measure (NQM) of the effect of additive noise. The NQM, which is based on Peli's (1990) contrast pyramid, takes into account the following: 1) variation in contrast sensitivity with distance, image dimensions, and spatial frequency; 2) variation in the local luminance mean; 3) contrast interaction between spatial frequencies; 4) contrast masking effects. For additive noise, we demonstrate that the nonlinear NQM is a better measure of visual quality than peak signal-to noise ratio (PSNR) and linear quality measures. We compute the DM in three steps. First, we find the frequency distortion in the degraded image. Second, we compute the deviation of this frequency distortion from an allpass response of unity gain (no distortion). Finally, we weight the deviation by a model of the frequency response of the human visual system and integrate over the visible frequencies.

Certain applications in cryptography require the use of a truly RNG, a device which produces unpredictable and unbiased digital signals derived from a fundamental noise mechanism. For IC-based cryptographic systems, an RNG must harness randomness from a low-power noise signal yet remain insensitive to deterministic influences such as crosstalk, power supply noise, and clock signal coupling through the substrate. An RNG IC utilizing established analog IC design techniques was designed and fabricated in a 2-/spl mu/m CMOS technology.

"Relevance of magnetostriction and forces for the generation of audible noise of transformer cores","B. Weiser; H. Pfutzner; J. Anger","Inst. of Fundamentals & Theory of Electrotech., Bioelectric., Univ. of Technol., Vienna, Austria; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","","2000","36","5","3759","3777","Recently, the two most significant characteristics of power transformer cores, i.e., loss and noise, have been reduced considerably because of improved material and improved core design. An undisputed base value of noise results from magnetostriction (MS) due to the global magnetization of limbs and yokes, whereas excess values are attributed to different mechanisms, such as excess MS and magnetic forces (MF), in a controversial way. However, a multistep lap (MSL; number of overlap steps N>1) yields considerably lower noise than a single-step lap (SSL; N=1), indicating a specific role of joint design. The present work was aimed at a deeper understanding as a tool for further improvements. For a large number of differently built-up single-phase model cores, local distributions of surface displacements d/sub x/, d/sub y/, d/sub z/ and velocities v/sub x/, v/sub y/, v/sub z/ as well as the corresponding noise n were determined. As a major finding, MSL yielded weak reductions of in-plane vibrations v/sub x/ and V/sub y/, considerable reductions of v/sub z/, and strong reductions of n. Interpretations of results were based on numerical Spice modeling of linearized joint vibrations, which were also established experimentally. The results indicate high values of off-plane flux density B/sub z/ and the corresponding Maxwell stress arising at the outermost sheet ends for SSL, and considerably lower values for MSL, provided that B is below its critical value B/sub c/. MSL yielded reductions of d/sub z/, v/sub z/, and n in 80% of all cases. Three additional core parameters-small air gap lengths, high overlap lengths, and high lamination factors A-all lead to reduced n; the use of oil yielded strong reductions. It is concluded that joint designs actually play a predominant role in noise generation. Apart from some contribution from attractive in-plane forces due to B/sub z/, in air gaps, interlaminar flux B/sub z/ yields primary sources of vibrations that propagate to the entire core surface. In core regions of reduced /spl Lambda/, B/sub z/ yields vibrations of sheet ends due to MF according to an experimentally determined effective Young's modulus that considers practical conditions like waviness, burrs, and thickness variations of laminations. For high h, oscillations of the whole core thickness due to B/sub z/-caused MS will arise close to joints. For MSL, all of these mechanisms become less relevant: Gap regions show much lower B/sub x/ and, provided B<B/sub c/, also lower B/sub z/, apart from being regionally distributed. Further, imperfections of joint assembling are less critical. As a consequence, the noise level of modern MSL power transformer cores, as commercially assembled with homogeneous compression and high N, can be well predicted by mere consideration of MS resulting from global magnetization.","1941-0069","","10.1109/20.908346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=908346","","Magnetostriction;Transformer cores;Magnetic cores;Magnetic noise;Power transformers;Magnetization;Lamination;Assembly;Noise reduction;Magnetic materials","magnetostriction;acoustic noise;transformer cores;power transformers;coils;magnetic forces;magnetic flux;laminations","magnetostriction;audible noise;transformer cores;power transformer;global magnetization;limbs;yokes;magnetic forces;multistep lap;joint design;single-phase model cores;surface displacements;in-plane vibrations;Spice modeling;linearized joint vibrations;off-plane flux density;Maxwell stress;core parameters;air gap lengths;overlap lengths;lamination factors;interlaminar flux;effective Young's modulus;homogeneous compression","","108","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, a SVC model which uses the firing angle as the state variable provides key information for cases when the load flow solution is used to initialize other power system applications, e.g., harmonic analysis. The SVC state variables are combined with the nodal voltage magnitudes and angles of the network in a single frame-of-reference for a unified, iterative solution through Newton methods.

An electrostatic precipitator (ESP) can be operated with a high collection efficiency and a low pressure drop. Recently, an ESP also has been used for cleaning indoor air. In this review, principles of electrostatic precipitation, such as particle charging, migration velocity of charged particles and collection efficiency, are described. The performance of the ESP deteriorates by abnormal phenomena, including back corona for treating high resistivity dust, abnormal re-entrainment for low resistivity dust, and corona quenching for fine dusts. To cope with these phenomena, new technologies have been developed. Pulsed energization is a technique which copes with high resistivity dusts, and this results in lower power consumption. Using pulsed energization, non-thermal plasma can be generated and chemical reactions can be promoted for treating gaseous pollutants such as NO and volatile organic compounds. Wet ESP can also remove dusts and gaseous pollutants simultaneously. These new advancements will widen the field of application of electrostatic precipitation.

After a brief review of the objectives of channel length extraction and previous extraction methods, the principle and the algorithm of the latest ""shift and ratio"" (S&R) method are described. The S&R method allows the channel mobility to be an arbitrary function of gate voltage and, at the same time, provides a way to determine the threshold voltage of short-channel devices independent of their parasitic resistances. Accurate and consistent results are obtained from nMOSFET and pMOSFET data down to 0.05 /spl mu/m channel length. By applying the S&R method to model generated current-voltage (I-V) curves, it is shown that the extracted channel length should be interpreted in terms of the injection points where the MOSFET current spreads from the surface layer into the bulk source-drain region. This implies significant degradation of short-channel effects (SCE's) if the lateral source-drain doping gradient is not abrupt enough.

The technique is particularly useful when applied to inductors in which the fabrication process includes integration substrate removal. However, it is also applicable to inductors on low-loss substrates. The method optimizes the width of the metal strip for each turn of the inductor coil, leading to a variable strip-width layout. The optimization procedure has been successfully applied to the design of square spiral inductors in a silicon-based multichip-module technology, complemented with silicon micromachining postprocessing. The obtained experimental results corroborate the validity of the proposed method. A Q factor of about 17 have been obtained for a 35-nH inductor at 1.5 GHz, with Q values higher than 40 predicted for a 20-nH inductor working at 3.5 GHz.

The experiments on a large number of urban street scenes demonstrate that the proposed algorithm: (1) can detect pedestrians in various poses, shapes, sizes, clothing, and occlusion status; (2) runs in real-time; and (3) is robust to illumination and background changes.","1558-0016","","10.1109/6979.892151","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=892151","","Neural networks;Object detection;Shape;Motion detection;Robustness;Layout;Image segmentation;Real time systems;Telecommunication traffic;Cameras","object detection;object recognition;stereo image processing;image segmentation;driver information systems;feedforward neural nets;multilayer perceptrons","pedestrian detection;dangerous traffic situations;cluttered scene;moving cameras;stereo-based segmentation;neural network-based recognition;sub-image object candidates;disparities discontinuity;intensity gradients;pedestrian recognition;urban street scenes","","247","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As part of the introduction, a historical background and discussion is given on why this test method has drawn attention. A section on physical defects with in-depth discussion and examples is used to illustrate why a test method outside the voltage environment is required. Data with additional information from case studies is used to explain the effectiveness of Iddq testing. In Section IV, design issues, design styles, Iddq test vector generation and simulation methods are discussed. The concern of whether Iddq testing will remain useful in deep submicron technologies is addressed (Section V). The use of Iddq testing for reliability screening is described (Section VI). The current measurement methods for Iddq testing are given (Section VII) followed by comments on the economics of Iddq testing (Section VIII).

In parallel and in the context of an accelerating trend towards deregulation of the electric industry, the unbundling of services, many grouped under ancillary services, should create a market for some of these services. This paper discusses the potential of distributed generation (DG) to provide some of these services. In particular, DG can serve locally as the equivalent of a spinning reserve and voltage support of the AC bus. The main types of distributed generation with emphasis on the power electronic interface and the configurations appropriate to provide ancillary services are reviewed. The flexibility and features provided by the power electronic interface are illustrated. In addition to control of the real power, other functions can be incorporated into the design of the interface to provide services, such as reactive power, and resources associated with power quality. These include voltage sag compensation and harmonic filtering. The implications on the design of the power converter interface are discussed.","","0-7803-6420-1","10.1109/PESS.2000.868792","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=868792","","Distributed control;Power electronics;Voltage fluctuations;Power harmonic filters;Context-aware services;Acceleration;Spinning;Reactive power control;Power quality;Filtering","electric power generation;distribution networks;power convertors;commutation;invertors;load flow control;power system control;power supply quality;power system harmonics;power harmonic filters","distributed generation;ancillary services;electric power quality;availability;electric industry deregulation;services unbundling;spinning reserve equivalent;AC bus voltage support;power electronic interface;real power control;reactive power;power quality;voltage sag compensation;harmonic filtering;power converter interface;self commutated converters;power flow control;inverters","","174","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traffic delays and congestion, in general, increase travel time and have a negative economic impart. We analyze the kinematics of the vehicles involved in a lane changing/merging maneuver, and study the conditions under which lane changing/merging crashes can be avoided. That is, given a particular lane change/merge scenario, we calculate the minimum longitudinal spacing which the vehicles involved should initially have so that no collision, of any type, takes place during the maneuver. Simulations of a number of examples of lane changing maneuvers are used to demonstrate the results. The results of this paper could be used to assess the safety of lane changing maneuvers and provide warnings or take evasive actions to avoid collision when combined with appropriate hardware on board of vehicles.","1939-9359","","10.1109/25.901899","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=901899","","Collision avoidance;Merging;Vehicle crash testing;Vehicles;Vehicle safety;Road transportation;Road accidents;Delay effects;Kinematics;Hardware","automobiles;collision avoidance;kinematics;road traffic;safety","collision avoidance analysis;lane changing;lane merging;highway system;traffic delays;traffic congestion;kinematics;lane changing/merging crashes;minimum longitudinal spacing;simulations;safety;lane changing maneuvers","","126","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Over 70 drivers have driven the SmartCar for 1.25 hours in the greater Boston area. Graphical models, HMM and coupled HMM, have been trained using the experiment driving data to create models of seven different driver maneuvers: passing, changing lanes right and left, turning right and left, starting and stopping. We show that, on average, the predictive power of our models is of 1 second before the maneuver starts taking place.

The potential field functions for obstacles contain tunable parameters. The multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is utilized to identify the optimal potential field functions. Fitness functions such as goal-factor, obstacle-factor, smoothness-factor and minimum-pathlength-factor are developed for the MOEA selection criteria. An algorithm named escape-force is introduced to avoid the local minima associated with EAPF. Moving obstacles and moving goal positions were considered to test the robust performance of the proposed methodology. Simulation results show that the proposed methodology is efficient and robust for robot path planning with non-stationary goals and obstacles.","","0-7803-6375-2","10.1109/CEC.2000.870304","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=870304","","Path planning;Robustness;Artificial intelligence;Navigation;Genetic algorithms;Optimization methods;Mobile robots;Vehicles;Fuzzy control;Testing","path planning;genetic algorithms;mobile robots;real-time systems","evolutionary artificial potential fields;real time robot path planning;genetic algorithms;optimal potential field functions;moving obstacles;tunable parameters;multiobjective evolutionary algorithm;fitness functions;MOEA selection criteria;escape-force algorithm;local minima","","99","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"The software radio concept","E.

In 2000 the industrial competition between Asia, Europe, and America promises a very difficult path toward the definition of a unique standard for future mobile systems, although market analyses underline the trading benefits of a common worldwide standard. It is therefore in this field that the software radio concept is emerging as a potential pragmatic solution: a software implementation of the user terminal able to dynamically adapt to the radio environment in which it is, time by time, located. In fact, the term software radio stands for radio functionalities defined by software, meaning the possibility to define by software the typical functionality of a radio interface, usually implemented in TX and RX equipment by dedicated hardware. The presence of the software defining the radio interface necessarily implies the use of DSPs to replace dedicated hardware, to execute, in real time, the necessary software. In this article objectives, advantages, problem areas, and technological challenges of software radio are addressed. In particular, SW radio transceiver architecture, possible SW implementation, and its download are analyzed.","1558-1896","","10.1109/35.868153","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=868153","","Software radio;Radio frequency;Digital signal processing chips;Hardware;Digital signal processing;Computer architecture;Signal processing;Protocols;Field programmable gate arrays;Asia","software architecture;transceivers;cellular radio;digital radio;telecommunication standards;network interfaces","cellular mobile systems;digital standards;analog standards;industrial competition;Asia;Europe;America;market analysis;common worldwide standard;user terminal;software implementation;radio environment;radio interface;DSP;radio receiving equipment;radio transmitting equipment;software radio transceiver architecture","","166","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The selection and quality of the features representing each pattern affect the success of subsequent classification. Feature extraction is the process of deriving new features from original features to reduce the cost of feature measurement, increase classifier efficiency, and allow higher accuracy. Many feature extraction techniques involve linear transformations of the original pattern vectors to new vectors of lower dimensionality. While this is useful for data visualization and classification efficiency, it does not necessarily reduce the number of features to be measured since each new feature may be a linear combination of all of the features in the original pattern vector. Here, we present a new approach to feature extraction in which feature selection and extraction and classifier training are performed simultaneously using a genetic algorithm. The genetic algorithm optimizes a feature weight vector used to scale the individual features in the original pattern vectors. A masking vector is also employed for simultaneous selection of a feature subset. We employ this technique in combination with the k nearest neighbor classification rule, and compare the results with classical feature selection and extraction techniques, including sequential floating forward feature selection, and linear discriminant analysis. We also present results for the identification of favorable water-binding sites on protein surfaces.","1941-0026","","10.1109/4235.850656","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=850656","","Genetic algorithms;Vectors;Feature extraction;Pattern recognition;Costs;Data visualization;Data mining;Nearest neighbor searches;Linear discriminant analysis;Proteins","pattern classification;genetic algorithms;feature extraction;computational complexity","dimensionality reduction;genetic algorithms;GA;pattern recognition;measurable features;feature extraction;feature weight vector optimization;feature subset selection;k nearest neighbor classification rule;sequential floating forward feature selection;linear discriminant analysis;favorable water-binding site identification;protein surfaces","","527","","42","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The stochastic properties of a proposed first-order model based on these models are examined. The limitations of using an information theoretic metric, which is sometimes used to justify a first-order Markov chain as a sufficient model for very slowly fading channels, are discussed. A simple method of qualitatively comparing autocorrelation functions is instead proposed. The usefulness of the first-order Markov chain in representing the flat-fading channel is examined by looking at two specific problems in wireless system applications that represent two disparate cases. The first case involves analysis over a short duration of time, relative to the inverse of the normalized Doppler frequency, while the second involves analysis over a long duration of time. Contrary to previous reports, the results indicate that first-order Markov chains are not generally suitable for very slowly fading channels. Rather, first-order Markov chains can be suitable for very slowly fading applications, which require analysis over only a short duration of time.","1558-0857","","10.1109/26.891214","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=891214","","Fading;Rayleigh channels;Gaussian processes;Rayleigh scattering;Autocorrelation;Frequency;Markov processes;Receiving antennas;Statistical distributions;Stochastic processes","Rayleigh channels;Markov processes;radiocommunication;Doppler effect;correlation methods;electromagnetic wave scattering;radiowave propagation;receiving antennas;land mobile radio;error correction codes","first-order Markov modeling;Rayleigh fading channel;received signal amplitude;flat-fading channel;first-order finite-state Markov chains;stochastic properties;information theoretic metric;autocorrelation functions;wireless system applications;short time duration;inverse normalized Doppler frequency;long time duration;very slowly fading channels;scattering propagation;ISORA model;isotropic scattering omnidirectional receiving antenna;mobile radio channel;error correction code;block-error rates;fade duration distributions","","215","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This preconditioning method is based on first applying the loop-tree or loop-star decomposition of the currents to arrive at a Helmholtz decomposition of the unknown currents. However, the MoM matrix thus obtained still cannot be solved efficiently by iterative solvers due to the large number of iterations required. We propose a permutation of the loop-tree or loop-star currents by a connection matrix, to arrive at a current basis that yields a MoM matrix that can be solved efficiently by iterative solvers. Consequently, dramatic reduction in iteration count has been observed. The various steps can be regarded as a rearrangement of the basis functions to arrive at the MoM matrix. Therefore, they are related to the original MoM matrix by matrix transformation, where the transformation requires the inverse of the connection matrix. We have also developed a fast method to invert the connection matrix so that the complexity of the preconditioning procedure is of O(N) and, hence, can be used in fast solvers such as the low-frequency multilevel fast multipole algorithm (LP-MLFMA). This procedure also makes viable the use of fast solvers such as MLFMA to seek the iterative solutions of Maxwell's equations from zero frequency to microwave frequencies.","1558-2221","","10.1109/8.899680","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=899680","","Integral equations;Maxwell equations;Microwave frequencies;Matrix decomposition;Moment methods;Electromagnetics;Radar antennas;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical sensors;Geometry","Maxwell equations;method of moments;electric current;Helmholtz equations;iterative methods;matrix inversion;computational complexity;electric field integral equations","integral equation solution;Maxwell's equations;microwave frequencies;matrix equation preconditioning;method of moments;permutation;electric field integral equation;EFIE;loop-tree decomposition;loop-star decomposition;connection matrix;Helmholtz decomposition;MoM matrix;loop-tree current;loop-star current;iterative solvers;basis functions;matrix transformation;inverse connection matrix;complexity;low-frequency multilevel fast multipole algorithm;fast solvers;conducting bodies","","325","","53","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We tackle the problem by explicitly exploiting the nonstationarity of the acoustic sources. Changing cross correlations at multiple times give a sufficient set of constraints for the unknown channels. A least squares optimization allows us to estimate a forward model, identifying thus the multipath channel. In the same manner we can find an FIR backward model, which generates well separated model sources. Furthermore, for more than three channels we have sufficient conditions to estimate underlying additive sensor noise powers.

The stability of the closed-loop system composed of a nonlinear speed tracking controller and an observer is studied by the way of Lyapunov theory. Furthermore, the decoupling of the state observer and the load torque observer is discussed. Finally, a real-time implementation and the experimental results of the proposed control strategy are presented.","1557-9948","","10.1109/41.836350","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=836350","","Torque control;Synchronous motors;Observers;AC motors;Acceleration;Stability;Feedback;Control systems;Lyapunov method;Nonlinear equations","permanent magnet motors;synchronous motors;machine control;velocity control;tracking;observers;Lyapunov methods;control system synthesis;closed loop systems;nonlinear control systems;machine theory;control system analysis","permanent-magnet synchronous motor;speed tracking control;state observer;load torque observer;unknown load torque disturbance;mathematical model;control design;exact linearization methodology;tracking control algorithm i;closed-loop system;stability;Lyapunov theory;control simulation;decoupling;control strategy","","113","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike in other modalities, such as X-ray computerized tomography, MR images taken for the same patient on the same scanner at different times may appear different from each other due to a variety of scanner-dependent variations and, therefore, the absolute intensity values do not have a fixed meaning. The authors have devised a two-step method wherein all images (independent of patients and the specific brand of the MR scanner used) can be transformed in such a may that for the same protocol and body region, in the transformed images similar intensities will have similar tissue meaning. Standardized images can be displayed with fixed windows without the need of per-case adjustment. More importantly, extraction of quantitative information about healthy organs or about abnormalities can be considerably simplified. This paper introduces and compares new variants of this standardizing method that can help to overcome some of the problems with the original method.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.836373","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=836373","","Magnetic resonance imaging;Standardization;Protocols;Body regions;Humans;Image segmentation;X-ray imaging;Computed tomography;Data mining;Displays","medical image processing;biomedical MRI","MRI scale standardization method;image display;image normalization;magnetic resonance imaging;medical diagnostic imaging;two-step method;body region;tissue meaning;quantitative information extraction;healthy organs;abnormalities;scanner-dependent variations;absolute intensity values;fixed meaning;MR scanner brand","Algorithms;Brain;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Multiple Sclerosis","370","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the ever increasing demands on passengers' comfort, safety, emissions, and fuel consumption imposed by car manufacturers and regulations call for more robust techniques and the use of cycle-accurate models. We argue that these models must be hybrid because of the combination of time-domain and event-based behaviors. We present a hybrid model of the engine in which both continuous and discrete time-domain as well as event-based phenomena are modeled in a separate but integrated manner. Based on this model, we formalize the specification of the overall engine control by defining a number of hybrid control problems. To cope with the difficulties arising in the design of hybrid controllers, a design methodology is proposed. This methodology consists of a relaxation of the hybrid problem by simplifying some of its components to obtain a solvable problem,and then deriving a solution to the original control problem by appropriately modifying the control law so obtained to take into consideration the original specifications and models. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated on three challenging problems: fast force-transient control, cutoff control, and idle speed control.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.871300","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=871300","","Automotive engineering;Engines;Control systems;Time domain analysis;Force control;Control system synthesis;Virtual prototyping;Vehicle safety;Fuels;Virtual manufacturing","internal combustion engines;discrete time systems;continuous time systems;control system synthesis;velocity control","automotive engine control;hybrid systems;engine control systems;comfort;safety;emissions;fuel consumption;car manufacturers;regulations;cycle-accurate models;event-based behaviors;time-domain behaviours;hybrid control problems;fast force-transient control;cutoff control;idle speed control","","134","","68","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This model is then applied to design and analyze the CPW-to-CPS transitions with various structure parameters. In the higher frequency band, the partially prism-gridded finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is employed to take into account the bond-wire effect as well as the surface-wave leakage and space-wave radiation associated with the transition. In this study, results based on equivalent-circuit model, FDTD simulation, and measurement are compared. Good agreement among these results supports the usefulness of the proposed equivalent-circuit model and also validates the FDTD method.

Compared to existing protocols, some assign channels to hosts statically (thus a host will occupy a channel even when it has no intention to transmit) some require a number of channels which is a function of the maximum connectivity, and some necessitate a clock synchronization among all hosts in the MANET.

A control system is presented in which the active and reactive power are independently controlled with real and imaginary axis components of the supply current vector. A new damping method for supply current oscillations is introduced. The method operates in an open-loop manner and is very suitable for microcontroller implementation since the calculation power demand is low. Furthermore, it is shown that in the synchronously rotating coordinates, where the sinusoidal variables appear as DC quantities, the compensation of the reactive power drawn by the supply filter can be done very easily.

The grey theory can be employed to improve the control performance of a system without sufficient information or with highly nonlinear property. In this paper, a grey prediction model combined with a proportional plus derivative controller is proposed to balance an inverted pendulum, which is a classic example of an inherently nonlinear unstable system. The control objective is to swing up the pendulum from a stable position to an unstable position and bring its slider back to the origin of the track. The overall control algorithm is decomposed into two separate grey model controllers for swinging up and balancing, respectively, based upon the angular and velocity values of the pendulum. The experimental results show that this grey model controller is able to swing up and balance the inverted pendulum and guide its slider to the center of the track. It also has the robustness to balance the inverted pendulum at an upright position in suffering an external impact acting on the pendulum.","1939-9367","","10.1109/28.833761","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=833761","","Predictive models;Control systems;Nonlinear control systems;PD control;Proportional control;Angular velocity control;Legged locomotion;Mathematical model;Industry Applications Society;Mechanical engineering","pendulums;control system synthesis;grey systems;two-term control;position control;robust control;control system analysis;intelligent control","inverted pendulum control;grey prediction model;partial unknown structure;control design;partial unknown parameters;partial unknown characteristics;control performance;proportional plus derivative controller;control algorithm;robustness;control simulation","","118","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Opportunistic data structures with applications","P. Ferragina; G. Manzini","Dipt. di Inf., Pisa Univ., Italy; NA","Proceedings 41st Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","","2000","","","390","398","We address the issue of compressing and indexing data. We devise a data structure whose space occupancy is a function of the entropy of the underlying data set. We call the data structure opportunistic since its space occupancy is decreased when the input is compressible and this space reduction is achieved at no significant slowdown in the query performance. More precisely, its space occupancy is optimal in an information-content sense because text T[1,u] is stored using O(H/sub k/(T))+o(1) bits per input symbol in the worst case, where H/sub k/(T) is the kth order empirical entropy of T (the bound holds for any fixed k). Given an arbitrary string P[1,p], the opportunistic data structure allows to search for the occurrences of P in T in O(p+occlog/sup /spl epsiv//u) time (for any fixed /spl epsiv/>0). If data are uncompressible we achieve the best space bound currently known (Grossi and Vitter, 2000); on compressible data our solution improves the succinct suffix array of (Grossi and Vitter, 2000) and the classical suffix tree and suffix array data structures either in space or in query time or both. We also study our opportunistic data structure in a dynamic setting and devise a variant achieving effective search and update time bounds. Finally, we show how to plug our opportunistic data structure into the Glimpse tool (Manber and Wu, 1994). The result is an indexing tool which achieves sublinear space and sublinear query time complexity.","0272-5428","0-7695-0850-2","10.1109/SFCS.2000.892127","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=892127","","Data structures;Indexing;Entropy;Costs;Tree data structures;Plugs;Computer science;Fault tolerance;Postal services;Data engineering","data structures;data compression;database indexing;computational complexity;database theory","opportunistic data structures;data compression;data indexing;entropy;data set;query performance;search;succinct suffix array;suffix tree data structures;suffix array data structures;Glimpse tool;sublinear query time complexity;sublinear space complexity","","304","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But what if the actual performance of these systems falls short of the estimates? The authors designed this article to provide sufficient information to know what questions to ask when evaluating a biometric system, and to assist in determining whether performance levels meet the requirements of an application. For example, a low-performance biometric is probably sufficient for reducing-as opposed to eliminating-fraud. Likewise, completely replacing an existing security system with a biometric-based one may require a high-performance biometric system, or the required performance may be beyond what current technology can provide. Of the biometrics that give the user some control over data acquisition, voice, face, and fingerprint systems have undergone the most study and testing-and therefore occupy the bulk of this discussion.

Traffic flow is routed along shortest paths, splitting flow at nodes where several outgoing links are on shortest paths to the destination. The weights of the links, and thereby the shortest path routes, can be changed by the network operator. The weights could be set proportional to their physical distances, but often the main goal is to avoid congestion, i.e., overloading of links, and the standard heuristic recommended by Cisco is to make the weight of a link inversely proportional to its capacity. Our starting point was a proposed AT&T WorldNet backbone with demands projected from previous measurements. The desire was to optimize the weight setting based on the projected demands. We showed that optimizing the weight settings for a given set of demands is NP-hard, so we resorted to a local search heuristic. Surprisingly it turned out that for the proposed AT&T WorldNet backbone, we found weight settings that performed within a few percent from that of the optimal general routing where the flow for each demand is optimally distributed over all paths between source and destination. This contrasts the common belief that OSPF routing leads to congestion and it shows that for the network and demand matrix studied we cannot get a substantially better load balancing by switching to the proposed more flexible multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) technologies. Our techniques were also tested on synthetic internetworks, based on a model of Zegura et al., (1996), for which we did not always get quite as close to the optimal general routing.","0743-166X","0-7803-5880-5","10.1109/INFCOM.2000.832225","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=832225","","Telecommunication traffic;Web and internet services;Spine;Multiprotocol label switching;Throughput;Traffic control;Laboratories;Routing protocols;Load management;Testing","Internet;telecommunication traffic;telecommunication network routing;protocols;telecommunication congestion control;channel capacity;computational complexity;search problems;optimisation","Internet traffic engineering;OSPF;open shortest path first protocol;intra-domain Internet routing protocol;traffic flow;link weights;congestion;link capacity;AT&T WorldNet backbone;NP-hardness;local search heuristic;optimal general routing;demand matrix;load balancing;synthetic internetworks","","470","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As an added performance measure, predistortion is also analyzed with respect to its effect on amplifier efficiency. A nonuniform spacing technique is described which is simple to implement and has a performance very close to the cited optimum approach.

The support vector machine has the advantage that a smaller number of parameters for the model can be identified in a manner that does not require the extent of prior information or heuristic assumptions that some previous techniques require. Furthermore, the optimization method of a support vector machine is quadratic programming, which is a well-studied and understood mathematical programming technique. Support vector machine simulations are carried out on nonlinear problems previously studied by other researchers using neural networks. This allows initial comparison against other techniques to determine the feasibility of using the proposed method for nonlinear detection. Results show that support vector machines perform as well as neural networks on the nonlinear problems investigated. A method is then proposed to introduce decision feedback processing to support vector machines to address the fact that intersymbol interference (ISI) data generates input vectors having temporal correlation, whereas a standard support vector machine assumes independent input vectors. Presenting the problem from the viewpoint of the pattern space illustrates the utility of a bank of support vector machines. This approach yields a nonlinear processing method that is somewhat different than the nonlinear decision feedback method whereby the linear feedback filter of the decision feedback equalizer is replaced by a Volterra filter. A simulation using a linear system shows that the proposed method performs equally to a conventional decision feedback equalizer for this problem.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.875477","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=875477","","Support vector machines;Neural networks;Intersymbol interference;Nonlinear filters;Decision feedback equalizers;Machine learning;Optimization methods;Quadratic programming;Mathematical programming;Neurofeedback","learning automata;learning (artificial intelligence);quadratic programming;decision feedback equalisers;intersymbol interference;pattern recognition;nonlinear filters;telecommunication channels","support vector machines;nonlinear equalization;machine learning technique;communication systems;optimization method;quadratic programming;mathematical programming;nonlinear detection;decision feedback processing;intersymbol interference;ISI;temporal correlation;input vectors;pattern space;decision feedback equalizer;Volterra filter;SVM","","213","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Time segmented features are fed to a fuzzy system for training and classification. In order to obtain acceptable training speed and realistic fuzzy system structure, these features are clustered without supervision using the Basic Isodata algorithm at the beginning of the training phase, and the clustering results are used in initializing the fuzzy system parameters. Afterwards, fuzzy rules in the system are trained with the back-propagation algorithm. The fuzzy approach was compared with an artificial neural network (ANN) method on four subjects, and very similar classification results were obtained. It is superior to the latter in at least three points: slightly higher recognition rate; insensitivity to overtraining; and consistent outputs demonstrating higher reliability.

This modulation is ideally suited for Rayleigh fast-fading environments, since it does not require the receiver to know or learn the propagation coefficients. Unitary space-time modulation uses constellations of T/spl times/M space-time signals (/spl Phi//sub i/, l=1, ..., L), where T represents the coherence interval during which the fading is approximately constant, and M<T is the number of transmitter antennas. The columns of each /spl Phi//sub i/ are orthonormal. When the receiver does not know the propagation coefficients, which between pairs of transmitter and receiver antennas are modeled as statistically independent, this modulation performs very well either when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is high or when T/spl Gt/M. We design some multiple-antenna signal constellations and simulate their effectiveness as measured by bit-error probability with maximum-likelihood decoding. We demonstrate that two antennas have a 6-dB diversity gain over one antenna at 15-dB SNR.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.825818","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=825818","","Receiving antennas","receiving antennas;transmitting antennas;radio links;modulation;Rayleigh channels;information theory;demodulation;maximum likelihood decoding;error statistics;diversity reception","unitary space-time modulation;Rayleigh fast-fading;Rayleigh flat fading;information theory;signaling scheme;multiple-antenna communication links;space-time signals;coherence interval;transmitter antennas;propagation coefficients;receiver antennas;signal-to-noise ratio;SNR;multiple-antenna signal constellations;bit-error probability;maximum-likelihood decoding;diversity gain;channel coding;demodulation","","707","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The solution procedure relies on the application of an original control approach capable of enforcing a second-order sliding mode (i.e., a sliding regime on a surface s[x(t)]=0 in the system state space, with s/spl dot/[x(t)] identically equal to zero, a regime enforced by a control signal depending on s[x(t)], but directly acting only on s/spl uml/[x(t)]).

The mechanics of energy storage in a flywheel system are common to both steel- and composite-rotor flywheels. Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) is an energy storage device that stores electrical energy in a magnet field without conversion to chemical or mechanical forms. In SMES, a coil of superconducting wire allows a direct electrical current to flow through it with virtually no loss. This current creates the magnetic field that stores the energy.

It is shown that the proposed filter effectively reduces high frequency harmonics which can cause serious damage to the motor bearings and insulation. The proposed filter is comprised of a conventional resistance, inductance, capacitance (RLC) network cascaded with an LC trap filter. The LC trap, tuned to the inverter switching frequency, is very effective in reducing the switching harmonics. By using this new topology the need for high damping resistance and low RLC cut-off frequency is eliminated. This reduces the phase shift in the current regulation loop and increases the filter efficiency. Experimental verification of the filter topology is provided with a 180 V inverter and a 25 hp permanent magnet synchronous motor. Space-vector predictive current regulation is implemented as an inner-loop current regulator for the outer-loop speed control using a digital signal processor.

All information necessary to perform image segmentation is automatically derived from a training set that is presented in a form of segmentation examples. The training set is used to construct two models representing the objects-shape model and border appearance model. A two-step approach to image segmentation is reported. In the first step, an approximate location of the object of interest is determined. In the second step, accurate border segmentation is performed. The shape-variant Hough transform method was developed that provides robust object localization automatically. It finds objects of arbitrary shape, rotation, or scaling and can handle object variability. The border appearance model was developed to automatically design cost functions that can be used in the segmentation criteria of edge-based segmentation methods.

The final segmentation was compared to manually defined borders with good results [rms errors in pixels: 1.2 (cerebellum), 1.1 (corpus callosum), 1.5 (vertebrae), 1.4 (epicardial), and 1.6 (endocardial) borders]. Two major problems of the state-of-the-art edge-based image segmentation algorithms were addressed: strong dependency on a close-to-target initialization, and necessity for manual redesign of segmentation criteria whenever new segmentation problem is encountered.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.887613","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=887613","","Image edge detection;Object detection;Image segmentation;Active shape model;Cost function;Robustness;Image analysis;Algorithm design and analysis;Dynamic programming;Cities and towns","image segmentation;edge detection;medical image processing;modelling;knowledge representation;learning systems;Hough transforms;brain;cardiology","object localization;border detection criteria design;edge-based image segmentation;automated learning from examples;training set;shape model;border appearance model;two-step approach;shape-variant Hough transform method;cerebellum;corpus callosum;vertebrae;epicardial;medical diagnostic imaging;endocardial","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Brain;Computer Simulation;Heart;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Spine","113","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Transmission network reinforcement versus FACTS: an economic assessment","J. Mutale; G.

The most frequently stated economic benefit of FACTS devices id that they enable postponement of network reinforcement. This paper describes a linear programming approach for computing the maximum savings in operating costs that could be secured from installing ultimate (100%) FACTS. This gives the volume of the ""market"" potentially available for FACTS. As the main aim of this paper is to assess the competitiveness of FACTS against network reinforcement, only FACTS devices used for active power control are modeled. The volume of the market for FACTS, defined as the difference between the gross benefit of full network flexibility and the net benefit of network reinforcement is determined for a wide range of line reinforcement costs. It is shown that economics of FACTS are system specific and depend strongly on the cost of reinforcement. It is further concluded that at values of network reinforcement costs presently used in practice, FACTS devices may find it difficult to compete favorably with network reinforcement. The model employed in this evaluation takes account of inter-temporal load variations as well as network security constraints in addition to the usual generator output and transmission thermal limits.","1558-0679","","10.1109/59.871719","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=871719","","Power generation economics;Costs;Flexible AC transmission systems;Performance analysis;Linear programming;Power control;Power system modeling;Power system economics;Load management;Thermal loading","flexible AC transmission systems;linear programming;power transmission economics;power transmission control;power control","transmission network reinforcement;FACTS;economic assessment;flexible AC transmission systems;linear programming;operating costs savings;active power control;line reinforcement costs;inter-temporal load variations;network security constraints;transmission thermal limits;generator output limits","","38","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The fraction of channel bandwidth used by successfully transmitted messages gives a good indication of the protocol efficiency, and its maximum value is referred to as protocol capacity. In a previous paper we have derived the theoretical limit of the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol capacity. In addition, we showed that if a station has an exact knowledge of the network status, it is possible to tune its backoff algorithm to achieve a protocol capacity very close to its theoretical bound. Unfortunately, in a real case, a station does not have an exact knowledge of the network and load configurations (i.e., number of active stations and length of the message transmitted on the channel) but it can only estimate it. In this work we analytically study the performance of the IEEE 802.11 protocol with a dynamically tuned backoff based on the estimation of the network status. Results obtained indicate that under stationary traffic and network configurations (i.e., constant average message length and fixed number of active stations), the capacity of the enhanced protocol approaches the theoretical limits in all the configurations analyzed. In addition, by exploiting the analytical model, we investigate the protocol performance in transient conditions (i.e., when the number of active stations sharply changes).","1558-0008","","10.1109/49.872963","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=872963","","Access protocols;Media Access Protocol;Bandwidth;Wireless LAN;Multiaccess communication;Wireless application protocol;Performance analysis;Portable computers;Wireless networks;Programmable control","IEEE standards;telecommunication standards;access protocols;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 protocol;design;performance;adaptive backoff mechanism;WLAN;medium access control protocol;MAC protocol;limited communication bandwidth;wireless channel;channel bandwidth;protocol efficiency;protocol capacity;backoff algorithm;dynamically tuned backoff;network status;stationary traffic;network configurations;enhanced protocol;transient conditions","","344","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Voltage sags can be compensated for by voltage and power injection into the distribution system. By injecting voltage with a phase advance with respect to the sustained source-side voltage, reactive power can be utilized to help voltage restoration. Hence, the consumption of real power, from the perspective of the energy supply device, can be reduced. This energy-saving voltage injection comes at the expense of an increased voltage injection magnitude, load power swing, phase shift, and discontinuity of voltage wave-shape. For this reason, several proposed compensation strategies are examined, in terms of satisfying custom power while taking into consideration the capacity of the energy-storage device and the voltage injection constraint of dynamic voltage restorer.

This paper describes an attitude determination system that is based on two vector measurements of non-zero, non-colinear vectors. The algorithm is based on a quaternion formulation of Wahba's (1966) problem, whereby the error quaternion (q/sub e/) becomes the observed state and can be cast into a standard linear measurement equation. Using the Earth's magnetic field and gravity as the two measured quantities, a low-cost attitude determination system is proposed. An iterated least-squares solution to the attitude determination problem is tested on simulated static cases, and shown to be globally convergent. A time-varying Kalman filter implementation of the same formulation is tested on simulated data and experimental data from a maneuvering aircraft. The time-varying Kalman filter implementation of this algorithm is exercised on simulated and real data collected from an inexpensive triad of accelerometers and magnetometers. The accelerometers in conjunction with the derivative of GPS velocity provided a measure of the gravitation field vector and the magnetometers measured the Earth's magnetic field vector. Tracking errors on experimental data are shown to be less than 1 degree mean and standard deviation of approximately 11 degrees in yaw, and 3 degrees in pitch and roll. Best case performance of the system during maneuvering is shown to improve standard deviations to approximately 3 degrees in yaw, and 1.5 degrees in pitch and roll.","","0-7803-5872-4","10.1109/PLANS.2000.838301","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=838301","","Position measurement;Magnetic field measurement;Navigation;Vectors;Quaternions;Earth;Testing;Accelerometers;Magnetometers;Velocity measurement","attitude measurement;magnetic sensors;least squares approximations;iterative methods;time-varying filters;Kalman filters;aircraft navigation;Global Positioning System;magnetometers;convergence of numerical methods;numerical stability","gyro-free quaternion-based attitude determination;low cost sensors;attitude determination systems;computationally efficient algorithms;robust algorithms;real-time vehicle navigation;vehicle guidance;vehicle control;vector measurements;nonzero noncolinear vectors;error quaternion;observed state;linear measurement equation;Earth's gravity;low-cost attitude determination system;iterated least-squares solution;simulated static cases;time-varying Kalman filter;simulated data;experimental data;accelerometers;magnetometers;GPS velocity;gravitation field vector;Earth's magnetic field vector;tracking errors;standard deviation;yaw;pitch;roll;performance;magnetic field sensors;convergence;stability","","72","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is desirable to have a simplified method of determining which islanding detection methods (IDMs) are most effective. In this paper, a previously described method for finding the nondetection zones (NDZs) of IDMs is experimentally verified. This method is used to determine the NDZs of several common IDMs. These results indicate that, of the IDMs discussed in this paper: (1) Sandia Frequency Shift (SFS) is most effective; and (2) the worst-case loads are low-power loads that are near resonance at the line frequency and have a large capacitance and small inductance (a high value of the quality factor Q).","1558-0059","","10.1109/60.875495","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=875495","","Phase detection;Frequency;Switches;Voltage;Reactive power;Photovoltaic systems;Capacitance;Strontium;Solar power generation;Hazards","photovoltaic power systems","islanding detection methods;phase criteria;nondetection zones;utility-interactive photovoltaic system;personnel hazards;equipment hazards;Sandia Frequency Shift;worst-case loads;near resonance low-power loads;capacitance;inductance;high quality factor","","215","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed drive offers such advantages as speed sensorless operation, better reliability, and more flexibility to manipulate the resultant torque-speed curve of the motor. In the proposed drive, zero-speed operation is achieved by independently controlling the two sets of stator currents, hence, maintaining a minimum electrical frequency independent of the mechanical speed. This feature is especially important to minimize the negative impact of the stator resistance influence at low-speed operation and it greatly simplifies the implementation of speed sensorless control schemes. The drive is well suited for either constant volts per hertz or field-oriented (FO) operation.

Faultless fabric is a repetitive and regular global texture and Fourier transforms can be applied to monitor the spatial frequency spectrum of a fabric. When a defect occurs in fabric, its regular structure is changed so that the corresponding intensity at some specific positions of the frequency spectrum would change. However, the three-dimensional frequency spectrum is very difficult to analyze. In this paper, a simulated fabric model is used to understand the relationship between the fabric structure in the image space and in the frequency space. Based on the three-dimensional frequency spectrum, two significant spectral diagrams are defined and used for analyzing the fabric defect. These two diagrams are called the central spatial frequency spectrums. The defects are broadly classified into four classes: (1) double yarn; (2) missing yarn; (3) webs or broken fabric; and (4) yarn densities variation. After evaluating these four classes of defects using some simulated models and real samples, seven characteristic parameters for a central spatial frequency spectrum are extracted for defect classification.","1939-9367","","10.1109/28.871274","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=871274","","Fabrics;Frequency;Inspection;Monitoring;Humans;Optical filters;Fourier transforms;Textile industry;Industry Applications Society","textile industry;image recognition;Fourier analysis;quality control;surface texture","fabric defect detection;Fourier analysis;repetitive regular global texture;spatial frequency spectrum monitoring;three-dimensional frequency spectrum;image space;frequency space;spectral diagrams;double yarn;missing yarn;webs;broken fabric;yarn densities variation;defect classification","","239","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These results suggest that further research should focus on developing techniques to find new attacks instead of extending existing rule-based approaches.","","0-7695-0490-6","10.1109/DISCEX.2000.821506","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=821506","","Intrusion detection;Internet;Electrical capacitance tomography;Contracts;Laboratories;Government;Training data;Automatic testing;Read only memory;Arm","safety systems;security of data","intrusion detection systems;DARPA off-line intrusion detection evaluation;automated attacks;denial-of-service;remote-to-local;user to root;rule-based approaches","","172","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A sensing system with a wide dynamic range has been developed to acquire fine images of vehicles under varied illumination conditions. The developed sensing system can expand the dynamic range of the image by combining a pair of images taken under different exposure conditions. In order to avert blurring of images against fast passing vehicles, a prism beam splitter installed a multilayered filter, and two charge-coupled devices are utilized to capture those images simultaneously. Furthermore, to extend the flexibility of camera placement, a recognition algorithm that can be applied to inclined plates has been developed. The performance of recognizing registration numbers on license plates has been investigated on real images of about 1000 vehicles captured under various illumination conditions. Recognition rates of over 99% (conventional plates) and over 97% (highly inclined plates) showed that the developed system is quite effective for license-plate recognition.","1939-9359","","10.1109/25.901900","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=901900","","Robustness;Vehicles;Image recognition;Licenses;Dynamic range;Lighting;Cameras;Image processing;Monitoring;Character recognition","image recognition;CCD image sensors;lighting;cameras;automobiles;optical beam splitters;optical prisms;optical filters","robust license-plate recognition method;passing vehicles;outside environment;sensing system;wide dynamic range;image acquisition;illumination conditions;image dynamic range;exposure conditions;prism beam splitter;multilayered filter;charge-coupled devices;camera placement;recognition algorithm;inclined plates;registration numbers;recognition rates","","126","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, the programmable LPF has a phase/gain compensator to estimate exactly stator flux in a wide speed range.

Information is generated in certain nodes and needs to reach a set of designated gateway nodes. Each node may adjust its power within a certain range that determines the set of possible one hop away neighbors. Traffic forwarding through multiple hops is employed when the intended destination is not within immediate reach. The nodes have limited initial amounts of energy that is consumed at different rates depending on the power level and the intended receiver. We propose algorithms to select the routes and the corresponding power levels such that the time until the batteries of the nodes drain-out is maximized. The algorithms are local and amenable to distributed implementation. When there is a single power level, the problem is reduced to a maximum flow problem with node capacities and the algorithms converge to the optimal solution. When there are multiple power levels then the achievable lifetime is close to the optimal (that is computed by linear programming) most of the time. It turns out that in order to maximize the lifetime, the traffic should be routed such that the energy consumption is balanced among the nodes in proportion to their energy reserves, instead of routing to minimize the absolute consumed power.","0743-166X","0-7803-5880-5","10.1109/INFCOM.2000.832170","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=832170","","Routing;Intelligent networks;Ad hoc networks;Wireless sensor networks;Educational institutions;Spine;Sensor systems;Relays;Energy states;Laboratories","telecommunication network routing;monitoring;telecommunication traffic;secondary cells;linear programming;packet radio networks","energy-conserving routing;wireless ad-hoc networks;sensor-based monitoring system;gateway nodes;traffic forwarding;multiple hops;power level;battery node drain-out maximization;maximum flow problem;linear programming","","430","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The MPC scheme proposed consists of a basic finite horizon nonlinear MPC technique with the introduction of an additional state constraint, which has been called a contractive constraint. The resulting MPC scheme has been denoted contractive MPC. This is a Lyapunov-based approach in which a Lyapunov function chosen a priori is decreased, not continuously, but discretely; it is allowed to increase at other times.

Because of adopting the gradient method by the BP neural network, the problems including a slow learning convergent velocity and easily converging to local minimum can not be avoided. In addition, the selection of the learning factor and inertial factor affects the convergence of the BP neural network, which are usually determined by experience. Therefore the effective application of the BP neural network is limited.

A fairly straightforward approach to accomplish size reduction in a transformer feeding a conventional rectifier-inverter system is to introduce an isolated DC-DC converter in the DC link, isolation being provided by a high frequency transformer. So also, several topologies that employ AC-AC converters connected on primary and secondary sides of a high frequency transformer to reduce the size and weight of the magnetic core have been reported in literature. Such AC-AC converters need switches with bi-directional voltage blocking and current carrying capability, which are commonly realized with pairs of gate turn-off devices such as insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT). This paper explores the possibilities of employing AC-AC switched mode power converters in combination with reactive elements to realize a chopped AC link, thereby decreasing the required magnetic core size for voltage transformation and isolation. A primary advantage of this approach is that, the static power converter needs only six devices to implement a three-phase electronic transformer, which makes it an economical solution. Operating principles, magnetic design and other practical issues are discussed. Detailed computer simulations accompanied with experimental verification are presented in the paper.","0197-2618","0-7803-6401-5","10.1109/IAS.2000.883173","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=883173","","Power electronics;Transformers;Frequency conversion;Magnetic cores;Switching converters;Insulated gate bipolar transistors;DC-DC power converters;Topology;Switches;Bidirectional control","transformers;AC-AC power convertors;switched mode power supplies;insulated gate bipolar transistors;magnetic cores","power electronic transformers;utility applications;size reduction;rectifier-inverter system;isolated DC-DC converter;DC link;high frequency transformer;AC-AC converters;secondary side;primary side;magnetic core;bi-directional voltage blocking;current carrying capability;gate turn-off devices;insulated gate bipolar transistors;IGBT;AC-AC switched mode power converters;reactive elements;chopped AC link;static power converter;three-phase electronic transformer;operating principles;magnetic design","","88","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The grammar and parser provide longer range temporal constraints, disambiguate uncertain low-level detections, and allow the inclusion of a priori knowledge about the structure of temporal events in a given domain.

Like conventional PID controllers there are several kinds of fuzzy PID controllers. Being simple structure, the research on how to choose the type of conventional PID controllers for different controlled plants is successful. Based on the analysis of relationship between conventional PID controller and fuzzy PID controller, we propose a method on how to choose the type of fuzzy PID controller suitable for the controlled plant. Firstly the selected fuzzy PID controller is designed to have the same control property with corresponding PID controller because the parameters of its control rule base are calculated according to tuned parameters of the PID controller. Then parameters of this fuzzy rule base of fuzzy PID controller are tuned by a sequential quadratic programming algorithm. The tuned control surface is nonlinear corresponding to the property of controlled plant. This method is applied to linear and nonlinear controlled plants. Simulation results show that it is an effective method for designing fuzzy controllers.","1098-7584","0-7803-5877-5","10.1109/FUZZY.2000.839169","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839169","","Three-term control;Design methodology;Fuzzy control;Control systems;Nonlinear control systems;Pi control;Proportional control;Fuzzy systems;Two-term control;PD control","three-term control;quadratic programming;fuzzy control;control system synthesis;linear systems;nonlinear control systems","general practical design method;fuzzy PID control;conventional PID control;fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative control system;sequential quadratic programming algorithm","","25","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Well, as broadband is deployed and the Internet heads toward all-optical, there will be a lot more e-mail, a lot more Web commerce, and so on. But what new applications will develop? For one thing, the Internet will subsume the telephone network. Telephone traffic is increasing less than 10 percent per year, while Internet traffic is doubling every four months. If Internet traffic did not surpass telephony by the end of the millennium, it will soon. Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) will be a trivia sidelight of the Internet right after that. After telephone, television. Internet protocols and bandwidth will need upgrading before television can be carried well, but it inevitably will move to the Internet. Why? The Internet can make television interactive: give it a million channels.

He means carrying television on the Internet, in packets, using Internet packets: TVoIP. After that: Internet telepresence. There will be major substitutions of communication for travel.

Phosphorus-doped polysilicon and gold films are applied separately in the silicon-to-glass fusion bonding and silicon-to-gold eutectic bonding experiments. These films are patterned as line-shape resistive heaters with widths of 5 or 7 /spl mu/m for the purpose of heating and bonding. In the experiments, silicon-to-glass fusion bonding and silicon to gold eutectic bonding are successfully achieved at temperatures above 1000/spl deg/C and 800/spl deg/C, respectively, by applying 1-MPa contact pressure. Both bonding processes can achieve bonding strength comparable to the fracture toughness of bulk silicon in less than 5 min. Without using global heating furnaces, localized bonding process is conducted in the common environment of room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Although these processes are accomplished within a confined bonding region and under high temperature, the substrate temperature remains low. This new class of bonding scheme has potential applications for microelectromechanical systems fabrication and packaging that require low-temperature processing at the wafer level, excellent bonding strength, and hermetic sealing characteristics.","1941-0158","","10.1109/84.825770","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=825770","","Silicon;Micromechanical devices;Fabrication;Temperature;Bonding processes;Heating;Wafer bonding;Gold;Semiconductor films;Furnaces","wafer bonding;micromechanical devices;semiconductor device packaging;fracture toughness;seals (stoppers);process heating;elemental semiconductors;silicon","localized fusion bonding;eutectic bonding;MEMS fabrication;packaging;line-shape resistive heaters;contact pressure;bonding strength;fracture toughness;global heating furnaces;localized bonding process;confined bonding region;substrate temperature;microelectromechanical systems;low-temperature processing;wafer level;hermetic sealing characteristics;5 micron;7 micron;1000 degC;800 degC;1 MPa","","158","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, their good transient and steady state performances cannot be achieved under wide load variations for a medical-use high-voltage X-ray generator, ranging from 20 kV to 150 kV in the output voltage and from 0.5 mA to 1250 mA, respectively. A high-voltage DC power supply designed for X-ray power generator applications is considered, which uses a series resonant inverter-linked multistage DC voltage multiplier instead of a conventional high-voltage diode module rectifier connected to the secondary side of a high-voltage transformer. A constant on-time/variable frequency control scheme of this converter operating at zero-current soft switching mode is described. Introducing the capacitor-diode cascaded multistage voltage multiplier, the secondary turn numbers and secondary-side stray capacitance of the high-voltage, high-frequency transformer, as well as the rectifier diode voltage ratings, can be greatly reduced. It is shown that the proposed converter control scheme of the two-step selective changed frequency selection switching is more effective for improving the output voltage responses. The series resonant high frequency transformer-linked voltage-multiplying rectifier is evaluated for an X-ray high-voltage generator on the basis of simulation analysis and observed data in experiment.","1350-2352","","10.1049/ip-epa:20000711","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=894421","","","X-ray production;power supplies to apparatus;switching circuits;DC-DC power convertors;resonant power convertors;pulse frequency modulation;high-frequency transformers;invertors;voltage multipliers;frequency control;voltage control;biomedical equipment","series resonant ZCS-PFM DC-DC converter;multistage rectified voltage multiplier;dual-mode PFM control scheme;medical-use high-voltage X-ray power generator;high-frequency inverters;constant value control schemes;steady state performance;transient performance;wide load variations;medical-use high-voltage X-ray generator;high-voltage DC power supply;series resonant inverter-linked multistage DC voltage multiplier;high-voltage transformer secondary side;constant on-time/variable frequency control;zero-current soft switching mode;capacitor-diode cascaded multistage voltage multiplier;secondary turn numbers;secondary-side stray capacitance;high-voltage high-frequency transformer;rectifier diode voltage ratings;two-step selective changed frequency selection switching;output voltage responses improvement;series resonant high frequency transformer;X-ray high-voltage generator;simulation analysis;output voltage control;20 to 150 kV;0.5 to 1250 mA","","53","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals"

In this approach, a process system is described by a fuzzy convolution model that consists of a number of quasi-linear fuzzy implications. In controller design, prediction errors and control energy are minimized through a two-layered iterative optimization process. At the lower layer, optimal local control policies are identified to minimize prediction errors in each subsystem. A near optimum is then identified through coordinating the subsystems to reach an overall minimum prediction error at the upper layer. The two-layered computing scheme avoids extensive online nonlinear optimization and permits the design of a controller based on linear control theory.

"Audio-visual speech modeling for continuous speech recognition","S. Dupont; J. Luettin","TCTS Lab., Mons Polytech. Inst., Belgium; NA","IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","","2000","2","3","141","151","This paper describes a speech recognition system that uses both acoustic and visual speech information to improve recognition performance in noisy environments. The system consists of three components: a visual module; an acoustic module; and a sensor fusion module. The visual module locates and tracks the lip movements of a given speaker and extracts relevant speech features. This task is performed with an appearance-based lip model that is learned from example images. Visual speech features are represented by contour information of the lips and grey-level information of the mouth area. The acoustic module extracts noise-robust features from the audio signal. Finally the sensor fusion module is responsible for the joint temporal modeling of the acoustic and visual feature streams and is realized using multistream hidden Markov models (HMMs). The multistream method allows the definition of different temporal topologies and levels of stream integration and hence enables the modeling of temporal dependencies more accurately than traditional approaches. We present two different methods to learn the asynchrony between the two modalities and how to incorporate them in the multistream models. The superior performance for the proposed system is demonstrated on a large multispeaker database of continuously spoken digits. On a recognition task at 15 dB acoustic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), acoustic perceptual linear prediction (PLP) features lead to 56% error rate, noise robust RASTA-PLP (relative spectra) acoustic features to 7.2% error rate and combined noise robust acoustic features and visual features to 2.5% error rate.","1941-0077","","10.1109/6046.865479","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=865479","","Speech recognition;Hidden Markov models;Signal to noise ratio;Acoustic noise;Noise robustness;Error analysis;Sensor fusion;Data mining;Feature extraction;Streaming media","Hidden Markov models;Speech recognition;Sensor fusion;Feature extraction;Multimedia systems;Learning by example;Face recognition","audio-visual speech modeling;continuous speech recognition;acoustic speech information;visual speech information;recognition performance;noisy environments;visual module;acoustic module;sensor fusion module;lip movements;speech features;appearance-based lip model;example images;example based learning;visual speech features;contour information;grey-level information;mouth area;noise-robust features;joint temporal modeling;multistream hidden Markov models;temporal dependencies;large multispeaker database;continuously spoken digits;signal-to-noise ratio;acoustic perceptual linear prediction features;noise robust RASTA-PLP;relative spectra;lipreading;speechreading","","299","","48","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We define code to be aged or decayed if its structure makes it unnecessarily difficult to understand or change and we measure the extent of decay by counting the number of faults in code in a period of time. Using change management data from a very large, long-lived software system, we explore the extent to which measurements from the change history are successful in predicting the distribution over modules of these incidences of faults. In general, process measures based on the change history are more useful in predicting fault rates than product metrics of the code: For instance, the number of times code has been changed is a better indication of how many faults it will contain than is its length. We also compare the fault rates of code of various ages, finding that if a module is, on the average, a year older than an otherwise similar module, the older module will have roughly a third fewer faults. Our most successful model measures the fault potential of a module as the sum of contributions from all of the times the module has been changed, with large, recent changes receiving the most weight.","1939-3520","","10.1109/32.859533","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=859533","","History;Predictive models;Software systems;Aging;Time measurement;Software measurement;Length measurement;Software development management;Statistical analysis;Degradation","software maintenance;software metrics;software fault tolerance;management of change","fault incidence;software change history;change management data;change history;fault potential;code decay;metrics;statistical analysis","","360","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One important class of visualization techniques which is particularly interesting for visualizing very large multidimensional data sets is the class of pixel-oriented techniques. The basic idea of pixel-oriented visualization techniques is to represent as many data objects as possible on the screen at the same time by mapping each data value to a pixel of the screen and arranging the pixels adequately. A number of different pixel-oriented visualization techniques have been proposed in recent years and it has been shown that the techniques are useful for visual data exploration in a number of different application contexts. In this paper, we discuss a number of issues which are important in developing pixel-oriented visualization techniques. The major goal of this article is to provide a formal basis of pixel-oriented visualization techniques and show that the design decisions in developing them can be seen as solutions of well-defined optimization problems. This is true for the mapping of the data values to colors, the arrangement of pixels inside the subwindows, the shape of the subwindows, and the ordering of the dimension subwindows. The paper also discusses the design issues of special variants of pixel-oriented techniques for visualizing large spatial data sets.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.841121","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=841121","","Data visualization;Multidimensional systems;Design optimization;Data mining;Information analysis;Shape;Data analysis;Statistical analysis;Machine learning;Artificial intelligence","data visualisation","pixel-oriented visualization techniques;multidimensional information;very large multidimensional data sets;data objects;visual data exploration;optimization problems;colors;subwindows","","212","","63","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The use of time delays in neural networks is neurobiologically motivated, since it is well known that signal delays are omnipresent in the brain and play an important role in neurobiological information processing. This concept has led to the development of dynamic neural networks. It is envisaged that dynamic neural networks, in addition to better representation of biological neural systems, offer better computational capabilities compared to their static counterparts.

We have sources in a finite Region I, and an arbitrary mathematical surface separating Regions I and II. The equivalent problems for the exterior and interior regions are specified with the use of electric and magnetic equivalent currents impressed on the boundary surface. The acceptance of the establishment by the equivalent sources of the non-intuitive null field for the exterior problem (by the equivalent sources and the original source for the interior problem) is commonly bothersome and not comfortably realized. In order to clarify this, we revisit Love's and Schelkunoff s forms of the equivalence principle. Subsequently, we discuss two simple, analytically tractable illustrative examples, consisting of plane-wave fields in two half-space regions, separated by an infinite planar surface. In particular, the emphasis is on the establishment of the non-intuitive null fields developed by these equivalent sources. Various forms of equivalence are illustrated by simple analytical field expressions.","1558-4143","","10.1109/74.868058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=868058","","Electromagnetic fields;Electromagnetic analysis;Engineering education;Electrical engineering education;Magnetic separation;Petroleum;Geometry","electrical engineering education;electromagnetic field theory;electromagnetic wave propagation","field equivalence principle;nonintuitive null fields;electromagnetics;interior region;exterior region;electric equivalent currents;magnetic equivalent currents;exterior problem;interior problem;plane-wave fields;half-space regions","","54","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The objectives of the control scheme are to improve the ride quality and handling performance within a given suspension stroke limitation. The ride quality is measured by the vertical acceleration of the vehicle body called the sprung mass.

To accomplish this goal, new pulse sequences can be developed to detect specifically the presence of a microbubble or group of microbubbles. We consider a new scheme to detect the presence of contrast agents in the body by examining the effect of transmitted phase on the received echoes from single bubbles. In this study, three tools are uniquely combined to aid in the understanding of the effects of transmission parameters and bubble radius on the received echo. These tools allow for optical measurement of radial oscillations of single bubbles during insonation, acoustical study of echoes from single contrast agent bubbles, and the comparison of these experimental observations with theoretical predictions. A modified Herring equation with shell terms is solved for the time-dependent bubble radius and wall velocity, and these outputs are used to formulate the predicted echo from a single encapsulated bubble.

The dimensions of the two arrays are identical. They differ in that plated-through vias have been repositioned to eliminate element resonances. One array was expected to operate from 1.0 to 4.6 GHz and the other from 1.0 to 5.9 GHz. It was found that, at low frequencies, the central elements are heavily affected by the finiteness of the arrays due to strong mutual coupling between array elements. Extrapolation of the observations indicates that a tapered-slot phased array, designed for wide-angle scanning, should be comprised of at least 30-40 rows and columns of elements to obtain low-frequency performance that is comparable to infinite-array predictions. In spite of the smallness of the array, predicted-element resonances could be identified by examination of the phase of the mutual coupling coefficients. Based on these observations, the plated-through vias are adequate to remove element resonances.","1558-2221","","10.1109/8.900228","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=900228","","Phased arrays;Mutual coupling;Resonance;Extraterrestrial measurements;Frequency;Phase measurement;Geometry;Slotline;Stripline;Extrapolation","slot antenna arrays;antenna phased arrays;microwave antenna arrays;antenna testing;electromagnetic wave polarisation;resonance;electromagnetic coupling;scanning antennas","experimental results;dual-polarized phased arrays;measured data;mutual coupling coefficients;scan-element patterns;element resonances;numerical infinite-array analysis;plated-through vias;low frequencies;wide-angle scanning;low-frequency performance;infinite-array;UHF;SHF;endfire tapered-slot phased arrays;1.0 to 4.6 GHz;1.0 to 5.9 GHz","","97","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Chaos report, and numerous documents citing it, label these canceled projects as ""failed"" and imply that all 31.1 percent of them were canceled because of poor software management. This implication is both false and hazardous. It is false because, particularly in an era of rapid change, a lot of software projects are properly started, well managed, and properly terminated before completion because their original assumptions have changed. It is hazardous because it often leaves software managers with the following temptation: ""It's becoming clear that continuing this project will waste company resources. I should probably have the project canceled now, but that would make me the manager of a failed project and wreck my career. I'll be better off if I say nothing, keep the project going, and look for a new project to transfer to.""

Instead of binary, numeric, or symbolic representation, by adopting qubit chromosome as a representation GQA can represent a linear superposition of solutions due to its probabilistic representation. As genetic operators, quantum gates are employed for the search of the best solution. Rapid convergence and good global search capability characterize the performance of GQA. The effectiveness and the applicability of GQA are demonstrated by experimental results on the knapsack problem, which is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem.

The total sliding-mode control comprises the baseline model design and the curbing controller design. In the baseline model design a computed torque controller is designed to cancel the nonlinearity of the nominal plant. In the curbing controller design an additional controller is designed using a new sliding surface to ensure the sliding motion through the entire state trajectory. Therefore, in the total sliding-mode control system the controlled system has a total sliding motion without a reaching phase. Then, to relax the requirement for the bound of uncertainties, an adaptive sliding-mode control system is investigated to control the induction servomotor. In the adaptive sliding-mode control system a simple adaptive algorithm is utilised to estimate the bound of uncertainties.

This representation significantly simplifies the solution to navigation problems, by eliminating any perspective effects. The nature of each navigation task is taken into account when designing the required navigation skills and environmental representations. We propose two main navigation modalities: topological navigation and visual path following. Topological navigation is used for traveling long distances and does not require knowledge of the exact position of the robot but rather, a qualitative position on the topological map. The navigation process combines appearance based methods and visual servoing upon some environmental features. Visual path following is required for local, very precise navigation, e.g., door traversal, docking. The robot is controlled to follow a prespecified path accurately, by tracking visual landmarks in bird's eye views of the ground plane. By clearly separating the nature of these navigation tasks, a simple and yet powerful navigation system is obtained.","2374-958X","","10.1109/70.897802","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=897802","","Navigation;Cameras;Robot vision systems;Motion planning;Animals;Mobile robots;Visual servoing;Biology computing;Robustness;Insects","path planning;mobile robots;robot vision;CCD image sensors;topology;position control","vision-based navigation;environmental representations;omnidirectional camera;indoor environments;catadioptric sensor;orthographic view;perspective effects;navigation skills;topological navigation;visual path following;appearance based methods;visual servoing;door traversal;docking;bird's eye views","","188","","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

All parameters of the model have physical interpretation, and can either be measured directly or estimated in a numerically reliable procedure. An adaptive control algorithm is then described, enabling speed tracking while minimizing the torque ripple.

First of all, a discrete-time model of the STATCOM is derived to take into account the discrete-time implementation of the controller. Secondly, the control algorithm is detailed. It ensures decoupled control of the real and reactive power exchanged between the power converter and the electric-energy system. This is necessary to control the DC capacitor voltage during transients of the exchanged reactive power. Finally, the control of the capacitor voltage is explained in detail. The controller is tailored to keep the capacitor voltage almost constant in spite of the fast control of the reactive power. This helps to reduce the capacitor size significantly.

This is achieved by introducing a current source or a resistor between the opamp negative input terminal and one of the supply rails. Hence, in this technique, opamps with limited input common-mode range can be used. In addition, switches can be incorporated in these circuits to allow a wide range of applications. This technique also allows large input and output signal swings (close to rail-to-rail), even at a very low-voltage supply. To demonstrate the proposed technique, four track-and-hold amplifiers (THA's) and a 10 bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC) have been designed in a conventional 1.2 /spl mu/m CMOS process and tested at a 1 V supply. The DAC consumes less than 0.45 mW and has a maximum throughput of 1 MS/s, with close to rail-to-rail output (0.1-0.9 V). The maximum differential nonlinearity error and integral nonlinearity error were measured to be 1.7 least significant bits (LSB's) and 3.0 LSB's, respectively.

Advancements in transmission technology have led to the availability of low-cost satellite earth terminals. The superior remote access capabilities of satellite networks are foreseen to provide broadband services to geographically diverse user groups. The desire to support a wide range of broadband services in satellite networks implies that many features present in terrestrial multimedia networks will also emerge in satellite networks. The interest in TCP/IP, DVB, and ATM is also demonstrated by the architecture of some proposed new satellite systems. Access to broadband services via satellites is one of the major issues and depends on the type of orbit of the satellite system. This is the motivation for discussing orbits and their features in this article. Different technical features can be achieved when the satellite system serves as an access system and when it serves as an access and core (transport) system. Broadband services need broadband frequency channels. The discussion about spectrum availability led to the conclusion that BSM systems can operate at higher bands, i.e., Ka and V, or they must use unique solutions to be compatible with the existing systems. The problem of electromagnetic compatibility is discussed in many places in this article. There is also a classification of user terminals and a list of services the BSM systems can offer. Of course, for each particular system this list depends on the features of the BSM system, which is selected by the designer and the future operator. Three types of protocols/platforms can be identified when BSM systems are considered. There are TCP/IP and ATM protocols and the DVB-S platform. This article presents three BSM system concepts: ARCS, Teledesic, and Skybridge. They have been chosen to present several technical aspects, i.e., how to use geostationary satellites in BSM, highly asymmetrical links, bandwidth on demand, beam diversity, spectrum efficiency, EMC aspects, etc. ARCS is a geostationary system with both links provided by the satellite. Many other BSM GSO systems plan to use similar concept (e.g., Direct PC), but only ARCS is well advanced in the standardization process and use of satellite links in both directions. Two other systems, Teledesic and Skybridge, use LEO orbits and are designed with a completely different architecture. Teledesic provides satellite access as well as a satellite core network, while Skybridge is a satellite access system. They differ in coverage, frequency utilization, constellation, and many other important parameters. Considering all this, presenting these three concepts, it is possible to show many technical issues. Other solutions of broadband multimedia systems based on high altitudes platform systems (HAPS) are also presented. The conclusion presents an opinion about the future of BSM systems.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2000.5340721","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5340721","","Multimedia systems;Availability;TCPIP;Digital video broadcasting;Frequency;Electromagnetic compatibility;Protocols;Satellite ground stations;Bandwidth;Standardization","broadband networks;electromagnetic compatibility;high altitude stratospheric platforms;multimedia communication;satellite communication","broadband satellite multimedia systems;low-cost satellite earth terminals;superior remote access capabilities;satellite networks;broadband services;terrestrial multimedia networks;TCP/IP;DVB;ATM;broadband frequency channels;spectrum availability;electromagnetic compatibility;user terminals;ARCS;Teledesic;Skybridge;geostationary satellites;highly asymmetrical links;bandwidth on demand;beam diversity;spectrum efficiency;EMC aspects;standardization process;satellite links;LEO orbits;satellite access system;satellite core network;frequency utilization;constellation;HAPS;high altitude platform systems","","30","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed decentralized overlapping control law is obtained by using the inclusion principle, i.e., by decomposing the original system model by an appropriate input/state expansion, and by applying the linear quadratic (LQ) optimization to the locally extracted subsystems. The local quadratic criteria directly reflect the desired system performance. Optimization is carried out by using a sequential algorithm adapted to the lower block triangular (LBT) structure of the closed-loop system model. Contraction to the original space provides a decentralized platoon controller which preserves the asymptotic stability and the steady-state behavior of the controller obtained in the expanded space. Conditions for eliminating the ""slinky effect"" and obtaining the strict string stability are defined; it is shown that the corresponding constraints on the controller parameters are not too restrictive. A new dynamic platoon controller structure, consisting of a reduced order observer and a static feedback map, is obtained by applying the inclusion principle to the decentralized overlapping platoon control design in the case when the information from the preceding vehicle is missing.

In this paper, a novel method is proposed by formulating an algorithm to reconfigure distribution networks for loss minimization. An efficient technique is used to determine the switching combinations, select the status of the switches, and find the best combination of switches for minimum loss. In the first stage of the proposed algorithm, a limited number of switching combinations is generated and the best switching combination is determined. In the second stage, an extensive search is employed to find out any other switching combination that may give rise to minimum loss compared to the loss obtained in the first stage. The proposed method has been tested on a 33-bus system, and the test results indicate that it is able to determine the appropriate switching-options for optimal (or near optimal) configuration with less computation. The results have been compared with those of established methods reported earlier and a comparative study is presented. With the proposed method, for any input load conditions of the system, the optimum switching configuration can automatically be identified within a reasonable computer time and hence the method can be effectively employed for continuous reconfiguration for loss reduction. The method can be effectively used to plan and design power systems before actually implementing the distribution networks for locating the tie-switches and providing the minimum number of sectionalizing switches in the branches to reduce installation and switching costs.","","0-7803-5902-X","10.1109/DRPT.2000.855672","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=855672","","Minimization methods;Intelligent networks;Switches;Heuristic algorithms;System testing;Kirchhoff's Law;Multimedia systems;Power systems;Costs;Automation","distribution networks;power system analysis computing;losses;minimization;switching","distribution networks;power loss minimization method;network reconfiguration;switching-options;switching combinations;computer time;power systems;computer simulation","","99","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Search algorithms, either deterministic or stochastic, that search such a space without constraint, fall foul of exponential computational complexity. One approach is to introduce constraints: either labelling using markers or colour coding, prior assumptions about motion trajectories or view restrictions. Another is to relax constraints arising from articulation, and track limbs as if their motions were independent. In contrast, we aim for general tracking without special preparation of objects or restrictive assumptions. The principal contribution of the paper is the development of a modified particle filter for search in high dimensional configuration spaces. It uses a continuation principle based on annealing to introduce the influence of narrow peaks in the fitness function, gradually.

This approach has immediately gained popularity, owing to the fact that it avoids the use of canonical forms, requires the determination of only one structural parameter, and has been empirically shown to yield MIMO models with good accuracy in many cases, However, the SS approach suffers from several drawbacks: there is no well-established rule tied to this approach for determining the structural parameter, and, perhaps more important the SS parameter estimates depend on the data in a rather complicated way, which renders almost futile any attempt to analyze and optimize the performance of the estimator. In this paper, we consider a transfer function (TF) approach based on instrumental variables (IV), as an alternative to the SS approach. We use the simplest canonical TF parameterization in which the denominator is equal to a scalar polynomial times the identity matrix. The analysis and optimization of the statistical accuracy of the TF approach is straightforward. Additionally, a simple test tailored to this approach is devised for estimating the single structural parameter needed. A simulation study, in which we compare the performances of the SS and the TF approaches, shows that the latter can provide more accurate models than the former at a lower computational cost.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.875466","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=875466","","MIMO;System identification;Structural engineering;Yield estimation;Linear systems;Parameter estimation;Performance analysis;Transfer functions;Instruments;Polynomials","linear systems;parameter estimation;state-space methods;MIMO systems;approximation theory;transfer functions;signal processing","MIMO system identification;state-space approximation;subspace approximation;transfer function;instrumental variables;multi-input multi-output linear systems;structural parameter;SS parameter estimates;scalar polynomial;identity matrix;denominator;statistical accuracy;optimization;computational cost","","39","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, a prototype double-gated RF amplifier using two MOSFETs is implemented and its RF characteristics are compared with those of a single one. The results show that, compared with a conventional single-gate transistor amplifier, the third order intermodulation (IMD/sub 3/) is improved by 6 dB with similar gain, fundamental output power, and DC power consumption. Because the auxiliary transistor is smaller than the main one and biased at subthreshold, adding this does not affect amplifier characteristics appreciably other than the nonlinearity. With further optimization using multiple gated transistors, much better nonlinear performance per power consumption would be expected.","1558-2329","","10.1109/75.867854","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=867854","","Linearization techniques;MOSFET circuits;Radiofrequency amplifiers;Energy consumption;Linearity;Prototypes;Power amplifiers;High power amplifiers;Telephone sets;Intermodulation distortion","MOSFET circuits;Intermodulation distortion;Linearization techniques;UHF amplifiers;UHF field effect transistors","linearization technique;MOSFET RF amplifier;multiple gated transistors;common source transistors;nonlinear characteristics compensation;third order intermodulation;subthreshold biasing;IMD;900 MHz","","82","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Biometric features such as the face or a fingerprint can be stored on a microchip in a credit card, for example. A single feature, however, sometimes fails to be exact enough for identification. Another disadvantage of using only one feature is that the chosen feature is not always readable. Dialog Communication Systems (DCS AG) developed BioID, a multimodal identification system that uses three different features-face, voice, and lip movement-to identify people. With its three modalities, BioID achieves much greater accuracy than single-feature systems. Even if one modality is somehow disturbed-for example, if a noisy environment drowns out the voice-the ether two modalities still lead to an accurate identification. This article goes into detail about the system functions, explaining the data acquisition and preprocessing techniques for voice, facial, and lip imagery data. The authors also explain the classification principles used for optical features and the sensor fusion options (the combinations of the three results-face, voice, lip movement-to obtain varying levels of security).","1558-0814","","10.1109/2.820041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=820041","","Biometrics;Security;Fingerprint recognition;Credit cards;Distributed control;Working environment noise;Optical noise;Data acquisition;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical sensors","biometrics (access control);face recognition;speaker recognition;data acquisition;sensor fusion","multimodal biometric identification system;physical features;face;fingerprint;credit card;microchip;Dialog Communication Systems BioID;lip movement;voice;noisy environment;data acquisition;data preprocessing;imagery;optical features;sensor fusion","","200","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

"Beyond Moore's law: Internet growth trends","L. G. Roberts","Packetcom Inc., USA","Computer","","2000","33","1","117","119","To keep pace with the Internet's growth, the maximum speed of core routers and switches must increase at the same rate. In a study conducted in 1969, the author analyzed 39 scientific computers released or planned for release from 1958 to 1972 to determine optimal computer replacement strategy (http://www.ziplink.net/lroberts/Forecast69.htm). This study looked at the trend of CPU throughput per dollar and predicted that computer performance would double every 18.6 months. Updating the study using data for 1999 PCs shows that the trend over 41 years is a doubling of computer performance every 21 months, a remarkably small correction. A similar study tracking the costs from the first ARPA packet switches in 1969 to the most modern routers and ATM switches in 1999 confirms that packet switches have followed the same trend as computers, with performance per dollar doubling every 21 months. Although the computer performance rate predicted in the updated 1969 study is similar to Moore's law, the trends are not identical. It would appear that both the performance per dollar for computers and the serial interface speed for communications are increasing at 94 percent of the yearly growth rate of semiconductor performance. We can use this information about performance and cost trends to predict the cost of computers and communications and to understand the Internet traffic growth. Keeping up with these trends will be a major engineering challenge.","1558-0814","","10.1109/2.963131","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=963131","","Moore's Law;Internet;Switches;Computer performance;Costs;Packet switching;Central Processing Unit;Throughput;Personal communication networks;Asynchronous transfer mode","Internet;telecommunication traffic;performance evaluation;packet switching;asynchronous transfer mode","Internet growth trends;core routers;switch speed;scientific computers;optimal computer replacement strategy;CPU throughput;computer performance;1999 PCs;ARPA packet switches;modern routers;ATM switches;packet switches;computer performance rate;serial interface speed;yearly growth rate;semiconductor performance;cost trends;Internet traffic growth;engineering challenge","","27","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

An important issue is the choice of adequate basis functions. The authors show that, contrary to the common belief, those that perform best are not interpolating. By opposition to traditional interpolation, the authors call their use generalized interpolation; they involve a prefiltering step when correctly applied. The authors explain why the approximation order inherent in any basis function is important to limit interpolation artifacts. The decomposition theorem states that any basis function endowed with approximation order ran be expressed as the convolution of a B spline of the same order with another function that has none. This motivates the use of splines and spline-based functions as a tunable way to keep artifacts in check without any significant cost penalty. The authors discuss implementation and performance issues, and they provide experimental evidence to support their claims.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.875199","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=875199","","Interpolation;Spline;Performance analysis;Biomedical imaging;Convolution;Cost function;Kernel;Heart;Sampling methods","interpolation;splines (mathematics);medical image processing","approximation theory;interpolation artifacts limitation;generalized interpolation;prefiltering step;basis function;B spline convolution;cost penalty;Fourier error kernal;performance issues;decomposition theorem;medical diagnostic imaging","Artifacts;Costs and Cost Analysis;Diagnostic Imaging;Diagnostic Imaging;Fourier Analysis;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Mathematics","576","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This creates a need for an accurate instantaneous-load forecast for the next several dozen minutes. This paper presents a novel approach to very short-time load forecasting by the application of artificial neural networks to model load dynamics. The proposed algorithm is more robust as compared to the traditional approach when actual loads are forecasted and used as input variables. It provides more reliable forecasts, especially when the weather conditions are different from those represented in the training data. The proposed method has been successfully implemented and used for online load forecasting in a power utility in the United States. To assure robust performance and training times acceptable for online use, the forecasting system was implemented as a set of parsimoniously designed neural networks. Each network was assigned a task of forecasting load for a particular time lead and for a certain period of day with a unique pattern in load dynamics. Some details of this are presented in the paper.","1558-0679","","10.1109/59.852131","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=852131","","Load forecasting;Artificial neural networks;Weather forecasting;Robustness;Power markets;Power generation;Economic forecasting;Load modeling;Predictive models;Heuristic algorithms","load forecasting;power system analysis computing;neural nets;electricity supply industry;learning (artificial intelligence)","very short-term load forecasting;artificial neural networks;deregulated competitive power market;electric utilities;independent system operator;load dynamics modelling;training data;USA;robust performance;time lead;load dynamics pattern;time of day","","156","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This model is based on a bistatic radar equation derived using the geometric optics limit of the Kirchhoff approximation. The waveform (i.e., the time-delayed power obtained in the delay-mapping technique) depends on a wave-slope probability density function, which in turn depends on wind. Waveforms obtained for aircraft altitudes and velocities indicate that altitudes within the interval 5-15 km are the best for inferring wind speed. In some regimes, an analytical solution for the bistatic radar equation is possible. This solution allows converting trailing edges of waveforms into a set of straight lines, which could be convenient for wind retrieval. A transition to satellite altitudes, together with satellite velocities, makes the peak power reduction and the Doppler spreading effect a significant problem for wind retrieval based on the delay-mapping technique. At the same time, different time delays and different Doppler shifts of the scattered GPS signal could form relatively small spatial cells on sea surface, suggesting mapping of the wave-slope probability distribution in a synthetic-aperture-radar (SAR) fashion. This may allow more accurate measurements of wind velocity and wind direction.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.841977","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=841977","","Global Positioning System;Oceans;Remote sensing;Optical scattering;Radar scattering;Wind speed;Solid modeling;Power system modeling;Bistatic radar;Equations","wind;atmospheric techniques;meteorological radar;remote sensing by radar;radar cross-sections;radar theory","marine atmosphere;meteorological radar;radar remote sensing;measurement technique;wind speed;radiosignal scattering;bistatic radar;GPS signal;theoretical model;Global Positioning System;bistatic radar equation;geometric optics;Kirchhoff approximation;waveform;wave-slope probability density function;wind retrieval;velocity;direction;wind","","506","","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This has raised potential problems of network protection. If, due to the action of the inverter or inverters, the local network voltage and frequency remain within regulatory limits when the utility is disconnected, then islanding is said to occur. Many methods to prevent this have been proposed and a SPICE-based model and analysis of the system are presented. Specifically aimed at predicting the effectiveness of two of these. These are: active frequency drift, which causes the inverter current to be generated slightly lower or higher in frequency than the frequency of the terminal voltage; and slip mode frequency shift, which controls the phase angle of the inverter current as a function of the frequency deviation of the terminal voltage from that of the normal network frequency. Experimental verification of the model is provided. Active frequency drift using frequency speed-up rather than speed-down is shown to be preferable for inductive loads, but conditions that resulted in islanding could be predicted. Slip mode frequency shift proved to be a more robust anti-islanding protection technique.","1350-2352","","10.1049/ip-epa:20000004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=820070","","","photovoltaic power systems","grid-connected PV inverters;islanding operation prediction;photovoltaic arrays;power network protection;SPICE-based model;active frequency drift;inverter current;slip mode frequency shift;phase angle;frequency deviation;inductive loads;anti-islanding protection technique","","78","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals"

It uses a third-order 4-bit /spl Delta//spl Sigma/ topology with data weighted averaging (DWA) to reduce the linearity requirements of the digital-to-analog converters in the feedback loop. The implementation of the DWA algorithm is optimized to minimize the delay introduced in the feedback loop, resulting in clock frequencies up to 100 MHz. Behavioral models are used to determine several building block specifications. An accurate model is used to analyze the combined effect of the dominant closed loop pole of the operational transconductance amplifier (OTA), the slew rate and the nonzero switch resistance. It is shown that the offset requirements for the quantizer result in a large input capacitance of the quantizer. Therefore scaling of the OTAs, as classically employed in single-bit /spl Delta//spl Sigma/ converters, can no longer be used. For an oversampling ratio of only 24, the converter achieves a signal-to-noise ratio of 95 dB, a signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio of 89 dB and an input dynamic range of 97 dB after comb-filtering. The converter is sampled at 60 MHz, resulting in a 2.5 MS/s output rate. It is implemented in a standard 0.65-/spl mu/m CMOS technology, occupies 5.3 mm/sup 2/ and consumes 295 mW from a 5-V power supply.

Activity is assumed to consist of neuronal ensembles-spikes clustered in space and in time. This paper quantifies tradeoffs faced in allocating bandwidth, granting access, and queuing, as well as throughput requirements, and concludes that an arbitered channel design is the best choice. The arbitered channel is implemented with a formal design methodology for asynchronous digital VLSI CMOS systems, after introducing the reader to this top-down synthesis technique. Following the evolution of three generations of designs, it is shown how the overhead of arbitrating, and encoding and decoding, can be reduced in area (from N to /spl radic/N) by organizing neurons into rows and columns, and reduced in time (from log/sub 2/(N) to 2) by exploiting locality in the arbiter tree and in the row-column architecture, and clustered activity.

Some researchers have divided this work into various tasks, including making changes to functionality (perfective), changing the environment (adaptive), correcting errors (corrective), and making improvements to avoid future problems (preventive). However, many have considered maintenance basically uniform over time. Because software development has changed considerably since its early days, the authors believe this approach no longer suffices. They describe a new view of the software life cycle in which maintenance is actually a series of distinct stages, each with different activities, tools, and business consequences. While the industry still considers postdelivery work as simply software maintenance, the authors claim that the process actually falls into stages. They think both business and engineering can benefit from understanding these stages and their transitions.","1558-0814","","10.1109/2.869374","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=869374","","Software maintenance;Programming;Error correction;Software tools;Systems engineering and theory;Spine;Frequency;Computer architecture;Computer industry;Software development management","software maintenance;software development management","staged model;software life cycle;software engineers;software maintenance;software development;business consequences;postdelivery work","","115","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

It provides satisfactory results for a level line with relatively uniform spans at any temperature, or for any span length of a level line at low temperature. The ruling span concept may result in an unacceptable error if it is used to calculate sags and tensions in a line segment with significantly unequal spans at high temperature. This paper presents a method to calculate sags and tensions of multi-span line segments at different temperatures based on the rotational stiffness of suspension insulator strings. A simple equation, based on the parabolic approximation, is derived to calculate changes in the span lengths and conductor sags and tensions. The method follows the ruling span concept but relaxes the fundamental assumption of the ruling span method.

The targets are moving along a highway, with varying obscuration due to changing terrain conditions. In addition, the roads can branch, merge or cross-the scenario represents target convoys along a realistic road network with junctions, changing terrains, etc. Some of the targets may also move in an open field. This constrained motion estimation problem is handled using an IMM estimator with varying mode sets depending on the topography, The number of models in the IMM estimator, their types and their parameters are modified adaptively, in real-time, based on the estimated position of the target and the corresponding road/visibility conditions. This topography-based variable structure mechanism eliminates the need for carrying all the possible models throughout the entire tracking period as in the standard IMM estimator, significantly improving performance and reducing computational load. Data association is handled using an assignment algorithm. The estimator is designed to handle a very large number of ground targets simultaneously. A simulated scenario consisting of over one hundred targets is used to illustrate the selection of design parameters and the operation of the tracker. Performance measures are presented to contrast the benefits of the VS-IMM estimator over the Kalman filter and the standard IMM estimator, The VS-IMM estimator is then combined with multidimensional assignment to gain ""time-depth."" The additional benefit of using higher dimensional assignment algorithms for data association is also evaluated.","1557-9603","","10.1109/7.826310","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=826310","","Target tracking;Motion estimation;Large-scale systems;Road transportation;Computational modeling;Measurement standards;Multidimensional systems;Systems engineering and theory;Traffic control;Surveillance","target tracking;tracking filters;adaptive filters;adaptive estimation;motion estimation;sensor fusion;surveillance;state estimation;modelling","ground target tracking;variable structure IMM estimator;interacting multiple model;groups of ground targets;constrained paths;moving target indicator reports;airborne sensor;varying obscuration;changing terrain conditions;constrained motion estimation problem;varying mode sets;visibility conditions;topography-based variable structure mechanism;reduced computational load;data association;assignment algorithm;design parameters;multidimensional assignment;adaptive estimator;sliding window mode;surveillance;state estimate;adaptive filter module selection","","190","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although efforts have been made to control pollution, water quality degradation has occurred in some of the important surface water supplies, aggravating the water resource shortage. At present, approximately three quarters of the city's wastewater is discharged untreated into the urban river system, resulting in serious pollution and negatively influencing the urban landscape and quality ot daily life. To counteract these measures, the city has implemented a comprehensive “Water Quality Management Plan” for the region, encompassing water pollution control, prevention of water body degradation, and improved water quality. The construction of municipal wastewater treatment plants is recognised as fundamental to controlling water pollution, and full secondary treatment is planned to be in place by the year 2015. Significant work is also required to expand the service area of the municipal sewage system and to upgrade and renovate the older sewer systems. The limitation on available water resources has also seen the emphasis shift to low water using industries and improved water conservation. Whilst industrial output has increased steadily over the past 10–15 years at around 10% per annum, industrial water usage has remained relatively constant. Part of the city's water quality management plan has been to introduce a strict discharge permit system, encouraging many industries to install on-site treatment facilities.","1007-0214","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6083303","water quality;waste water treatment;discharge permit system","Water resources;Water pollution;Rivers;Wastewater;Cities and towns;Water conservation;Surface contamination","","","","","","","","","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Studies were performed to analyze and compare the speech acoustics of separate male and female samples comprised of normal individuals and individuals carrying diagnoses of depression and high-risk, near-term suicidality. The female sample consisted of ten control subjects, 17 dysthymic patients, and 21 major depressed patients. The male sample contained 24 control subjects, 21 major depressed patients, and 22 high-risk suicidal patients. Acoustic analyses of voice fundamental frequency (F/sub 0/), amplitude modulation (AM), formants, and power distribution were performed on speech samples extracted from audio recordings collected from the sample members. Multivariate feature and discriminant analyses were performed on feature vectors representing the members of the control and disordered classes. Features derived from the formant and power spectral density measurements were found to be the best discriminators of class membership in both the male and female studies. AM features emerged as strong class discriminators of the male classes. Features describing F/sub 0/ were generally ineffective discriminators in both studies.

This paper is concerned with maximum likelihood array processing in non-Gaussian noise. We present the Cramer-Rao bound on the variance of angle-of-arrival estimates for arbitrary additive, independent, identically distributed (iid), symmetric, non-Gaussian noise. Then, we focus on non-Gaussian noise modeling with a finite Gaussian mixture distribution, which is capable of representing a broad class of non-Gaussian distributions that include heavy tailed, impulsive cases arising in wireless communications and other applications. Based on the Gaussian mixture model, we develop an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating the source locations, the signal waveforms, and the noise distribution parameters. The important problems of detecting the number of sources and obtaining initial parameter estimates for the iterative EM algorithm are discussed in detail. The initialization procedure by itself is an effective algorithm for array processing in impulsive noise. Novel features of the EM algorithm and the associated maximum likelihood formulation include a nonlinear beamformer that separates multiple source signals in non-Gaussian noise and a robust covariance matrix estimate that suppresses impulsive noise while also performing a model-based interpolation to restore the low-rank signal subspace. The EM approach yields improvement over initial robust estimates and is valid for a wide SNR range. The results are also robust to PDF model mismatch and work well with infinite variance cases such as the symmetric stable distributions. Simulations confirm the optimality of the EM estimation procedure in a variety of cases, including a multiuser communications scenario. We also compare with existing array processing algorithms for non-Gaussian noise.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.887045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=887045","","Array signal processing;Gaussian noise;Additive noise;Iterative algorithms;Maximum likelihood detection;Maximum likelihood estimation;Noise robustness;Gaussian distribution;Wireless communication;Position measurement","maximum likelihood estimation;array signal processing;direction-of-arrival estimation;optimisation;multiuser channels;covariance matrices;impulse noise","maximum-likelihood array processing;nonGaussian noise;Cramer-Rao bound;additive noise;angle-of-arrival estimates;impulsive noise;symmetric noise;finite Gaussian mixture distribution;independent identically distributed noise;i.i.d. noise;wireless communications;Gaussian mixture model;expectation-maximization algorithm;EM algorithm;source location estimation;signal waveforms;noise distribution parameters;iterative EM algorithm;nonlinear beamformer;covariance matrix estimate;model-based interpolation;low-rank signal subspace;multiuser communications","","99","","42","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Multiple-model adaptive estimation using a residual correlation Kalman filter bank","P. D. Hanlon; P. S. Maybeck","Air Force Inst. of Technol., Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","","2000","36","2","393","406","We propose a modified multiple model adaptive estimation (MMAE) algorithm that uses the time correlation of the Kalman filter residuals, in place of their scaled magnitude, to assign conditional probabilities for each of the modeled hypotheses. This modified algorithm, denoted the residual correlation Kalman filter bank (RCKFB), uses the magnitude of an estimate of the correlation of the residual with a slightly modified version of the usual MMAE hypothesis testing algorithm to assign the conditional probabilities to the various hypotheses that are modeled in the Kalman filter bank within the MMAE. This concept is used to detect flight control actuator failures, where the existence of a single frequency sinusoid (which is highly time correlated) in the residual of an elemental filter within an MMAE is indicative of that filter having the wrong actuator failure status hypothesis. This technique results in a delay in detecting the flight control actuator failure because several samples of the residual must be collected before the residual correlation can be estimated. However, it allows a significant reduction of the amplitude of the required system inputs for exciting the various system modes to enhance identifiability, to the point where they may possibly be subliminal, so as not to be objectionable to the pilot and passengers.","1557-9603","","10.1109/7.845216","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=845216","","Adaptive estimation;State estimation;Testing;Actuators;Aerospace control;History;Filter bank;Delay estimation;Frequency;Computer science","adaptive estimation;Kalman filters;correlation theory;aircraft control;filtering theory;probability;actuators;failure analysis","multiple-model adaptive estimation;residual correlation Kalman filter bank;modified MMAE algorithm;time correlation;Kalman filter residuals;conditional probabilities;flight control actuator failures;actuator failure detection;actuator failure status hypothesis;residual correlation estimation","","138","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Trends in technologies as well as circuit design are discussed. It is shown that the power required for a certain dynamic range and bandwidth decreases with minimum feature size as long as a constant ratio between signal swing and supply voltage can be maintained. Below 0.1µm channel-length, predictions of the threshold voltage endanger that requirement however. At circuit level, the problem that a low supply voltage poses on the use of switches and amplifiers is discussed. Various techniques are discussed to overcome these problems, like the use of low Vthtransistors, clock boosting, switched OpAmp technique, rail-to-rail input stages, back-gate driving circuits and CM level-shift techniques. Based on power estimates, the necessity of matching enhancing techniques like Auto-Zero techniques and Averaging is shown.","","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1471230","","CMOS technology;Switching circuits;Circuit synthesis;Dynamic range;Bandwidth;Threshold voltage;Low voltage;Switches;Clocks;Boosting","","","","44","","61","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since the motion of a person's head pose and gaze direction are deeply related with his/her intention and attention, detection of such information can be utilized to build natural and intuitive interfaces. We describe our real-time stereo face tracking and gaze detection system to measure head pose and gaze direction simultaneously. The key aspect of our system is the use of real-time stereo vision together with a simple algorithm which is suitable for real-time processing. Since the 3D coordinates of the features on a face can be directly measured in our system, we can significantly simplify the algorithm for 3D model fitting to obtain the full 3D pose of the head compared with conventional systems that use monocular camera. Consequently we achieved a non-contact, passive, real-time, robust, accurate and compact measurement system for head pose and gaze direction.","","0-7695-0580-5","10.1109/AFGR.2000.840680","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=840680","","Stereo vision;Face detection;Real time systems;Magnetic heads;Hardware;Cameras;Humans;Robustness;Deformable models;Streaming media","stereo image processing;real-time systems;face recognition;gesture recognition;feature extraction;tracking;user interface management systems","real-time stereo vision;head pose;gaze direction measurement;smart human interfaces;head motion;natural intuitive interfaces;face tracking;3D feature coordinates;3D model fitting;measurement system","","155","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Packaging of MEMS devices is more complex since in some cases it needs to provide protection from the environment while in some cases allowing access to the environment to measure or affect the desired physical or chemical parameters. Microscopic mechanical moving parts of MEMS have also their unique issues. Therefore, testing MEMS packages using the same methodologies, as those for electronics packages with standard procedures might not always be possible especially when quality and reliability need to be assessed. Single MEMS chip packaging approaches and their limitations in the packaging of high performance MEMS will be reviewed in this presentation and also identifies a need for a systematic approach for this purpose.

We show that interesting classes of hybrid systems can be abstracted to purely discrete systems while preserving all properties that are definable in temporal logic. The classes that permit discrete abstractions fall into two categories. Either the continuous dynamics must be restricted, as is the case for timed and rectangular hybrid systems, or the discrete dynamics must be restricted, as is the case for o-minimal hybrid systems.

However, these approaches can be, and in many cases have been, replaced by probabilistic methods that are able to respond to the actual stochastic factors that influence the reliability of the system. In the days of global, completely integrated and/or nationalized electricity supply industries, the only significant objective was the reliability seen by actual end users. Also, the system was structured in a relatively simple way such that generation, transmission, and distribution could be assessed as a series of sequential hierarchical levels. Failures at any level could cause interruptions of supply to the end user. All planning and operational criteria were intended to minimize such interruptions within economic limits. The system has been, or is being, restructured and now many individual parties are involved, often competitively, including generators, network owners, network operators, energy suppliers, regulators, as well as the end users. Each of these parties has a need to know the quality and performance of the system sector or subsector for which they are responsible. Therefore, there is now a need for a range of reliability measures; the actual measure(s) needed varying between the different system parties.

Eng., Illinois Univ., Urbana, IL, USA","Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","","2000","9","2","157","170","A tunable micromechanical bistable system is presented in this paper. It consists of a long slender micromechanical beam attached to an actuator. The beam is subjected to a transverse force at the middle and a residual stress developed during fabrication. The actuator generates a force along the axial direction of the beam, and is shared by the beam and springs of the actuator. If the total axial load on the beam is compressive and exceeds a critical value, then the beam buckles along the transverse direction and it has two possible equilibrium states. Thus, the actuator and beam together become a bistable system. An analytical model is presented to characterize the system. The model is based on the first mode of buckling of the beam. The model accounts for the elastic axial shortening of the beam and the nonlinear coupling between the beam and actuator. The main result of this paper is a closed-form relation between the transverse force and corresponding equilibrium transverse displacement of the beam for a given actuator force. An experimental micromechanical device is designed and fabricated to verify the theoretical model. Excellent correspondence is found between theory and experiment, as if the experimental device emulates the mathematical model, which is an important result of this paper, since now experimental studies, both quasi-static and dynamic, of bistable systems are possible, which are otherwise difficult to conduct with macrosystems. Several examples of possible applications of the bistable system are provided, including digital sensing of physical parameters.","1941-0158","","10.1109/84.846696","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=846696","","Actuators;Micromechanical devices;Stochastic resonance;Signal to noise ratio;Optical devices;Residual stresses;Fabrication;Springs;Analytical models;Optical coupling","tuning;microactuators;microsensors;micromechanical devices;stability;buckling;modelling","tunable bistable MEMS;micromechanical bistable system;micromechanical beam;microactuator;transverse force;residual stress;equilibrium states;analytical model;beam buckling;closed-form relation;equilibrium transverse displacement;transverse stiffness;actuator force;mathematical model;digital sensing;physical parameters sensing;data storage elements;memory elements;optomechanical computing elements","","128","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper we develop a simple analytic characterization of the steady-state send rate as a function of loss rate and round trip time (RTT) for a bulk transfer TCP flow. Unlike the models of Lakshman and Madhow (see IEE/ACM Trans. Networking, vol.5, p.336-50, 1997), Mahdavi and Floyd (1997), Mathis, Semke, Mahdavi and Ott (see Comput. Commun. Rev., vol.27, no.3, 1997) and by by Ott et al., our model captures not only the behavior of the fast retransmit mechanism but also the effect of the time-out mechanism. Our measurements suggest that this latter behavior is important from a modeling perspective, as almost all of our TCP traces contained more time-out events than fast retransmit events. Our measurements demonstrate that our model is able to more accurately predict TCP send rate and is accurate over a wider range of loss rates. We also present a simple extension of our model to compute the throughput of a bulk transfer TCP flow, which is defined as the amount of data received by the receiver in unit time.","1558-2566","","10.1109/90.842137","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=842137","","Loss measurement;Predictive models;Steady-state;Internet;Traffic control;Electronic mail;Multicast protocols;Data flow computing;Throughput;World Wide Web","transport protocols;telecommunication congestion control","TCP Reno performance;steady-state performance;bulk transfer TCP flow;FTP transfers;loss rate;steady-state send rate;round trip time;fast retransmit mechanism;time-out mechanism;measurements;modeling;throughput;congestion control","","806","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a result, a hyperspectral image pixel is actually a column vector with dimension equal to the number of spectral bands and contains valuable spectral information that can be used to account for pixel variability, similarity and discrimination. We present a new hyperspectral measure, the spectral information measure (SIM), to describe spectral variability and two criteria, spectral information divergence and spectral discriminatory probability for spectral similarity and discrimination, respectively. The spectral information measure is an information-theoretic measure which treats each pixel as a random variable using its spectral signature histogram as the desired probability distribution. Spectral information divergence (SID) compares the similarity between two pixels by measuring the probabilistic discrepancy between two corresponding spectral signatures. The spectral discriminatory probability calculates spectral probabilities of a spectral database (library) relative to a pixel to be identified so as to achieve material identification. In order to compare the discriminatory power of one spectral measure relative to another, a criterion is also introduced for performance evaluation, which is based on the power of discriminating one pixel from another relative to a reference pixel. The experimental results demonstrate that the new hyperspectral measure can characterize spectral variability more effectively than the commonly used spectral angle mapper (SAM).","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.857802","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=857802","","Image processing","image processing;spectral analysis;probability;information theory;random processes","information theory;spectral variability;spectral similarity;random variable;hyperspectral image analysis;image cube;spectral domain;spectral wavelengths;hyperspectral image pixel;column vector;spectral bands;spectral information;pixel variability;hyperspectral measure;spectral information measure;spectral information divergence;spectral discriminatory probability;spectral discrimination;spectral signature histogram;probability distribution;probabilistic discrepancy;spectral signatures;spectral database;library;material identification;performance evaluation;reference pixel;experimental results;spectral angle mapper","","281","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) have been used to design a state-dependent state-feedback law that maintains the state vector inside invariant feasible sets. For the purposes of prediction however, at each time instant, the state feedback law is assumed constant. In addition, due to the large number of LMIs involved, online computation becomes intractable for anything other than small dimensional systems. Here we propose an approach that deploys a fixed state-feedback law but introduces extra degrees of freedom through the use of perturbations on the fixed state-feedback law. The problem is so formulated that all demanding computations can be performed offline leaving only a simple optimization problem to be solved online. Over and above the very significant reduction in computational cost, the extra degrees of freedom allow for better performance and wider applicability.","1558-2523","","10.1109/9.871769","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=871769","","Robust control;Predictive control;Control systems;Time varying systems;State feedback;Stability;Robustness;Linear systems;Linear matrix inequalities;Vectors","linear systems;state feedback;predictive control;robust control;time-varying systems;uncertain systems;state-space methods","robust predictive control;fixed state-feedback law;computational cost;predictive constrained control;ellipsoidal invariant sets;linear matrix inequalities;state-dependent state-feedback law;invariant feasible sets;small dimensional systems","","307","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A set of bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) controlled by a microcontroller is used to route equalization current to the lowest voltage batteries. Since only the lowest voltage batteries are connected to the equalizer, the need for uniform transformer leakage inductance is avoided, and a lower power level can be used since no excess current flows to the other batteries.

To alleviate this problem, two practical and straightforward predictive schemes based on linear extrapolation are proposed. With the proposed schemes, the computational time delay of the control loop is compensated and the control loop bandwidth is increased. It is shown that, using the proposed techniques, the control loop bandwidth can be increased up to two times that of the conventional digital control loop. Also, the computational overhead needed to implement these techniques is kept to the minimum. A lab prototype system of a 1 kV full bridge DC power supply was set up for the proof of concept. The prototype system operated at 10 kHz and was controlled by a TI TMS320F240 DSP (20-MHz 16-bit fixed-point).

The pressure history of the steam bubbles is measured in conjunction with the pictures. In the experiment' the liquid column cavitated at the low pressures and then the cavities collapsed due to condensation causing high pressure pulses. The process was also simulated numerically.

The WDD measure is designed for comparing the distortion between original ECG signal and reconstructed ECG signal (after compression). The WDD is based on PQRST complex diagnostic features (such as P wave duration, QT interval, T shape, ST elevation) of the original ECG signal and the reconstructed one. Unlike other conventional distortion measures [e.g. percentage root mean square (rms) difference, or PRD], the WDD contains direct diagnostic information and thus is more meaningful and useful. Four compression algorithms were implemented (AZTEC, SAPA2, LTP, ASEC) in order to evaluate the WDD. A mean opinion score (MOS) test was applied to test the quality of the reconstructed signals and to compare the quality measure (MOS/sub error/) with the proposed WDD measure and the popular PRD measure. The evaluators in the WIGS test were three independent expert cardiologists, who studied the reconstructed ECG signals in a blind and a semiblind tests. The correlation between the proposed WDD measure and the MOS test measure (MOS/sub error/) was found superior to the correlation between the popular PRD measure and the MOS/sub error/.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2000.880093","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=880093","","Distortion measurement;Electrocardiography;Testing;Image coding;Cardiology;Image reconstruction;Root mean square;Compression algorithms;Length measurement;Signal design","electrocardiography;data compression;medical signal processing","weighted diagnostic distortion measure;ECG signal compression;signal distortion;original ECG signal;reconstructed ECG signal;P wave duration;QT interval;T shape;ST elevation;percentage root mean square difference;compression algorithms;mean opinion score test;semiblind tests;blind tests;signal quality;electrodiagnostics","Algorithms;Biomedical Engineering;Electrocardiography;Humans;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","199","","41","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We extend the general idea of a histogram to the homogeneity domain. In the first phase of the segmentation, uniform regions are identified via multilevel thresholding on a homogeneity histogram. While we process the homogeneity histogram, both local and global information is taken into consideration. This is particularly helpful in taking care of small objects and local variation of color images. An efficient peak-finding algorithm is employed to identify the most significant peaks of the histogram. In the second phase, we perform histogram analysis on the color feature hue for each uniform region obtained in the first phase. We successfully remove about 99.7% singularity off the original images by redefining the hue values for the unstable points according to the local information. After the hierarchical segmentation is performed, a region merging process is employed to avoid over-segmentation. CIE(L*a*b*) color space is used to measure the color difference.

In this paper, a digital-background calibration technique is proposed to minimize these effects. The proposed technique is based on digital interpolation, which estimates the correct output values from the output samples that suffer from timing errors. Since this technique requires an accurate estimation of the timing errors of the individual channels, a digital-background timing-error measurement technique is also proposed. Theoretical analysis, as well as simulation results, show that the calibration technique can greatly attenuate the spurs, and the SFDR can be significantly improved by 20-60 dB, depending on the digital hardware complexity and the ratio of sampling frequency and signal frequency. The major advantage of this technique is that all the calibration processes are carried out in the background using digital circuits, and only slight modification is required on the analog part of the ADC for obtaining a background estimation of the timing errors.","1558-125X","","10.1109/82.850419","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=850419","","Calibration;Timing;Frequency;Degradation;Dynamic range;Interpolation;Error correction;Measurement techniques;Signal analysis;Analytical models","calibration;timing;analogue-digital conversion;signal sampling","digital-background calibration technique;timing-error effects;time-interleaved ADCs;spurious-free dynamic range;output values;timing-error measurement technique;calibration technique;digital hardware complexity;sampling frequency;signal frequency;calibration processes;background estimation","","103","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The continuous exponential tapered shape is approximated by annular linearly tapered sections. The conical transmission-line theory and a variational method yield the electric field in each section. The radiation calculation is based on closed-form expressions for the dyadic Green's function of an elementary electric field source in a conducting half sheet. Both copolar and cross-polar radiation patterns of the Vivaldi antenna are calculated by integrating the Green's functions weighted by the electric field distribution over the antenna aperture.

Most radiometric slope corrections remove slope effects to account for the effective scattering pixel area. However, few studies address the slope effect on the radar cross section as a function of polarization states. The authors propose two approaches to compensate for this azimuth slope effect for POLSAR data. In the first approach, the digital elevation model (DEM), obtained from interferometric SAR or from other means, is used to estimate orientation angles, and in the second approach, orientation angles are derived directly from the POLSAR data. They have developed three new methods to implement this second approach. One is based on the right-right and left-left circular polarizations, and the other two are based on Cloude's and Huynelt's decompositions. The results are compared with the original polarization signature method using the DEM-generated orientation angles as the reference. POLSAR data is then compensated using the derived orientation angles. Significant changes were observed in many elements of the coherency matrix. The compensated POLSAR data should improve the accuracy of geophysical parameter estimation techniques. NASA/JPL AIRSAR data for an area in central California is used for illustration.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.868874","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=868874","","Azimuth;Polarization;Radar cross section;Synthetic aperture radar;Radiometry;Radar scattering;Digital elevation models;Matrix decomposition;Parameter estimation;NASA","geophysical techniques;terrain mapping;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;radar imaging;radar polarimetry","geophysical measurement technique;land surface;terrain mapping;radar remote sensing;synthetic aperture radar;azimuth slope variation;radar polarimetry;radar imaging;data compensation;polarimetric SAR;POLSAR;radiometric slope correction;effective scattering pixel area;radar cross section;polarization","","222","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One alternative under consideration is that of hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). An HEV combines some of the benefits of electric vehicles (efficient and clean motive power supplied by an electric motor, regenerative braking) with the features of a conventional vehicle that consumers expect (convenient refueling, long driving range). However, these benefits come with increased complexity in the powertrain design. Instead of having one motive power source, there are two that can each act independently or in combination. The complexity of an HEV powertrain together with the vehicle's many operating modes demand that a supervisory or hybrid controller be developed at the vehicle level to guarantee stable and consistent operation. Inherent in this controller is a logical structure to guide the vehicle through its various operating modes and a dynamic control strategy associated with each operating mode to specify the vehicle demands to each subsystem controller. Capturing all possible operating modes and guaranteeing smooth dynamic control transitions from one operating mode to the next are significant challenges in the controller design. A formal method for designing this supervisory controller has been developed. A description of the method and its application to an HEV will be presented.","","0-7803-6562-3","10.1109/CCA.2000.897440","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=897440","","Control systems;Hybrid electric vehicles;Mechanical power transmission;Vehicle dynamics;Fuels;Manufacturing;Power supplies;Electric motors;Vehicle driving;Design methodology","electric vehicles;control system synthesis;regenerative braking;stability;road vehicles","vehicle system controller design;hybrid electric vehicle;auto manufacturers;powertrain technologies;HEV;regenerative braking;convenient refueling;long driving range;powertrain design;electric motor","","61","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a newer notion, that of integral input-to-state stability (iISS), is studied. The notion of iISS generalizes the concept of finite gain when using an integral norm on inputs but supremum norms of states, in that sense generalizing the linear ""H/sup 2/"" theory.

The system employs special arrays of permanent magnets (Halbach arrays) on the moving car. The magnetic field from the arrays induces repelling currents in a close-packed array of shorted circuits in the track. Above a low transition speed (a few kilometers per hour), levitation forces approach a constant value, while drag forces decrease inversely with speed, with L/D reaching 200:1 or more at operating speeds. The high magnetic efficiency of the Halbach arrays, plus the use of close-packed track circuits, results in levitating forces approaching 40 metric tonnes per square meter (using NdFeB permanent magnet arrays, whose weight in typical cases is a few percent of the levitated weight). The system is passively stable: only motion is required for levitation. Failure of the drive system only results in the train slowing down and settling onto auxiliary wheels at a low speed. A detailed theoretical analysis of the Inductrack was made, on the basis of which a small-scale model was constructed and operated. The Laboratory is building a new small-scale model system (under NASA sponsorship) to demonstrate the acceleration rates and speeds (10-g and Mach 0.4 in the model) needed to magnetically launch rockets.","1558-2515","","10.1109/77.828377","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=828377","","Magnetic levitation;Laboratories;Permanent magnets;Magnetic circuits;Circuit testing;System testing;Magnetic fields;Wheels;Magnetic analysis;Buildings","magnetic levitation;railways;permanent magnets","Inductrack;magnetic levitation;Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory;passive magnetic bearings;permanent magnet arrays;Halbach arrays;magnetic field;repelling currents;close-packed array;shorted circuits;levitation forces;drag forces;high magnetic efficiency;close-packed track circuits;levitating forces;NdFeB permanent magnet arrays;auxiliary wheels;acceleration rates;magnetically launched rockets","","35","","3","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, utilization of hybrid boundary element modeling for specific Lamb wave mode incidence situations with special energy distributions along the structural cross section is proposed for estimating reflection and transmission from various scatterers, such as a step discontinuity and tapered parts of a waveguide, etc. Interaction of individual Lamb wave modes with scatterers that represent arbitrary thickness variation along the direction of guided wave propagation is investigated by calculating the scattered fields for varying incident modes, frequency, and scatterer shape. The mode conversion phenomena through step discontinuity in a plate are also experimentally explored.

Gate length scaling will be limited by the ability to control off-state leakage current due to quantum tunneling and thermionic emission between the source and drain as well as band-to-band tunneling between the body and drain. Lateral S/D doping abruptness requirements for gate length scaling are examined. V/sub T/ control will be challenging as a single gate material for both NMOS and PMOS devices cannot provide low yet symmetrical V/sub T/'s. CMOS integration will thus require dual gate workfunction tuning, channel doping, or asymmetrical double-gates to adjust V/sub T/.

The relative weighting of the voltages added is usually adjusted by trimming the ratio of two resistors. Although inexpensive resistors of suitable values are available in analog CMOS processes, the area of such resistors is increased in standard digital processes because silicide is often used to reduce the sheet resistance of the polysilicon and diffusion layers. As a result, the length and area of the required resistors is increased, increasing not only the cost, but also the susceptibility of the reference operation to substrate noise coupling. One way to overcome this problem is to use an extra mask to selectively block the silicide, but this mask also increases the cost. This paper presents a circuit solution to the above problem: a bandgap reference without resistors. It uses only MOS transistors biased in saturation or cutoff. The devices biased in saturation operate in strong inversion, for which accurate device models are usually available, simplifying the design process, especially in digital CMOS technologies.","0193-6530","0-7803-5853-8","10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839852","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839852","","Photonic band gap;Resistors;Voltage;Temperature;CMOS process;Silicides;Costs;CMOS technology;Diodes;Circuit noise","CMOS analogue integrated circuits;reference circuits","CMOS bandgap reference;forward bias voltage;proportional to absolute temperature;relative weighting;sheet resistance;diffusion layers;reference operation;mask;MOS transistors;saturation;cutoff;device models","","17","","2","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One approach for dealing with this problem is the distributed genetic algorithm model.

Making distinctions between the subpopulations by applying genetic algorithms with different configurations, we obtain the so-railed heterogeneous distributed genetic algorithms. These algorithms represent a promising way for introducing a correct exploration/exploitation balance in order to avoid premature convergence and reach approximate final solutions.

The principle can be probably extended to different applications (DC-to-DC converters, high power induction heating applications) but their study has been restricted to a low power induction heating context. In order to make this study, suitable models for the loaded inductors had to be found. Therefore, in the first part of this document, a number of different electrical inductor models, from the basic L-R equivalent circuit to a representation taking into account eddy currents effects, are presented. The second part describes the multi-load operating principle with respecting ZVS conditions, by the analysis of an R-L inductor model.

The signals can achieve low probability of error by exploiting multiple-antenna diversity. Because the fading coefficients are not known, the criterion for creating and evaluating the constellation is nonstandard and differs markedly from the familiar maximum-Euclidean-distance norm. Our construction begins with the first signal in the constellation-an oblong complex-valued matrix whose columns are orthonormal-and systematically produces the remaining signals by successively rotating this signal in a high-dimensional complex space. This construction easily produces large constellations of high-dimensional signals.

The modeling is based on the abc/dq transformation of the AC system variables. The currents injected by the active filter are controlled in the synchronous orthogonal dq frame using a decoupled nonlinear control strategy. The reference harmonic components are extracted from the sensed nonlinear load currents by applying the synchronous reference frame method, where a three-phase thyristor bridge rectifier with R-L load is taken as the nonlinear load. The voltage level of the DC side is regulated using a linearizing feedback control. The reference current needed to maintain a regulated DC voltage is added to the current loop reference. The transfer functions of the two loops are developed and synthesized to obtain the desired stability and dynamic response. Simulation results confirm the performances considered theoretically for the shunt active filter topology.","","0-7803-6499-6","10.1109/ICHQP.2000.896994","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896994","","Active filters;Power system modeling;Voltage control;Power harmonic filters;Thyristors;Bridge circuits;Rectifiers;Feedback control;Transfer functions;Stability","power harmonic filters;active filters;voltage control;nonlinear control systems;thyristor convertors;rectifying circuits;bridge circuits;feedback;dynamic response;electric current control","nonlinear control;shunt active power filter;synchronous reference frame;modeling;three-phase voltage source shunt active filter;abc/dq transformation;AC system variables;currents injection;synchronous orthogonal dq frame;decoupled nonlinear control strategy;reference harmonic components;nonlinear load currents sensing;three-phase thyristor bridge rectifier;R-L load;DC side voltage level regulation;linearizing feedback control;regulated DC voltage;transfer functions;dynamic response;stability;harmonic current compensation;harmonic current control","","53","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Carrier phase offset can be estimated if the coherent demodulation mode is adopted. The converted base-band complex signal is first frequency discriminated and then passed through a digital filter which performs a fast Fourier transform (FFT). The frequency offset can be estimated from the DC component of the FFT, and the symbol timing error can be estimated from the phase angle of the FFT at a specified frequency which is equal to an integral multiple of half the bit rate. These two estimated parameters are then used for frequency offset compensation and symbol timing recovery during a preamble period. Coarse carrier phase can be estimated by averaging sampled in-phase and quadrature-phase signals and finding its phase angle within the preamble period after carrier frequency offset is estimated and compensated. The bit error rate (BER) performance of this GMSK receiver architecture is assessed for an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel by computer simulation.","1939-9359","","10.1109/25.845105","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=845105","","Frequency estimation;Phase estimation;Timing;AWGN;Bit error rate;Frequency shift keying;Demodulation;Frequency conversion;Digital filters;Fast Fourier transforms","minimum shift keying;digital radio;radio receivers;frequency estimation;synchronisation;AWGN channels;fast Fourier transforms;digital filters;filtering theory;phase estimation;error statistics;digital simulation;land mobile radio;signal sampling","fully digital noncoherent GMSK receiver architecture;fully digital coherent GMSK receiver architecture;Gaussian minimum shift keying;joint frequency offset compensation;joint symbol timing error;symbol timing recovery;carrier phase offset;coherent demodulation;base-band complex signal;frequency discrimination;digital filter;fast Fourier transform;FFT;DC component;symbol timing error;phase angle;bit rate;preamble period;coarse carrier phase;sampled in-phase signals;sampled quadrature-phase signals;bit error rate;BER performance;additive white Gaussian noise;AWGN channel;computer simulation;mobile radio","","25","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Heightened interest in automatic surveillance and early forest-fire detection has taken precedence over traditional human surveillance because the latter's subjectivity affects detection reliability, which is the main issue for forest-fire detection systems. In current systems, the process is tedious, and human operators must manually validate many false alarms. Our approach, the False Alarm Reduction system, proposes an alternative real-time infrared-visual system that overcomes this problem. The FAR system consists of applying new infrared-image processing techniques and artificial neural networks (ANNs), using additional information from meteorological sensors and from a geographical information database, taking advantage of the information redundancy from visual and infrared cameras through a matching process, and designing a fuzzy expert rule base to develop a decision function. Furthermore, the system provides the human operator with new software tools to verify alarms.","2374-9423","","10.1109/5254.846287","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=846287","","Intelligent systems;Humans;Surveillance;Infrared sensors;Fires;Environmental economics;Real time systems;Artificial neural networks;Meteorology;Sensor systems","forestry;fires;disasters;surveillance;emergency services;real-time systems;infrared imaging;neural nets;geographic information systems;fuzzy logic;expert systems;computer vision;image matching","intelligent system;real-time infrared-visual system;infrared forest fire detection;environmental disasters;automatic surveillance;human operators;False Alarm Reduction system;infrared image processing;artificial neural networks;meteorological sensors;geographic information system;fuzzy expert rule base","","88","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Protective relays must filter their inputs to reject unwanted quantities and retain signal quantities of interest. Accuracy and convergent speed of the filter algorithm are essential for protective relays. A widely applied filter algorithm, the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) can easily erase harmonics using simple calculation. However, the voltage and current signals contain large harmonics and DC offset during the fault interval. The DC offset heavily influences the precision and convergence speed of the fundamental frequency signal from DFT. In this investigation, the authors present a novel Fourier algorithm to remove the DC offset in a voltage or current signal. Applying a full-cycle DFT (FCDFT) requires one cycle plus two samples to calculate and compensate for the DC offset. Half-cycle DFT (HCDFT) only requires half of a cycle plus two or three samples to accomplish the algorithm when the input signal has no even order harmonics. Adopting the proposed algorithm in distance relays effectively suppresses the DC offset and quickly decomposes the accurate fundamental frequency components.","1937-4208","","10.1109/61.847231","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=847231","","Voltage;Power harmonic filters;Protective relaying;Discrete Fourier transforms;Power system harmonics;Frequency;Digital relays;Power system relaying;Power system protection;Digital filters","power transmission lines;power transmission protection;power system relaying;relay protection;discrete Fourier transforms;filtering theory","power transmission line protection;distance relays;DC offset removal;current signals;voltage signals;Fourier filter algorithm;discrete Fourier transform;fault interval;convergence speed;fundamental frequency components decomposition","","118","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It originates in the fact that torque and flux is directly controlled by instantaneous space voltage vector unlike Field Oriented Control (FOC). For the reason, Direct Torque Control gradually has been used in the field requiring fast response since its introduction in the mid-1980's. In spite of these merits, Direct Torque Control has several problems. These problems are : (1) the variation of the switching frequency by hysteresis band and speed; (2) the increase of the torque ripple in the low speed region; (3) the short control period (25 /spl mu/s) for the good performances etc. To solve the problems of Direct Torque Control, several studies were carried out. This paper improves one of the drawbacks of Direct Torque Control, torque ripple, with the constant switching frequency. In some papers it was tried to improve the drawback, but some papers are very complicated and didn't show large improvement. Their methods even resulted in losing the merits of Direct Torque Control. In this paper Direct Torque Control method is performed with constant switching frequency.

Raibert had shown how to calculate the control effort required for the next step of a run based on the results of the previous step, using simple physics-based rules. But smoothly controlling joints in a continuous-time fashion to effect walking seemed more difficult, particularly for non-stead state conditions. It was unclear how to combine passive dynamics with active control. Other researchers were beginning to address robot walking, and the rich diversity of their approaches was very exciting. It thus seemed that walking was the next important area. We embarked on a two-pronged approach: one focusing on making improvements to electromechanical actuators and robot design, the other on walking algorithms and control.","1558-223X","","10.1109/100.876907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=876907","","Legged locomotion;Robots;Gears;Leg;Elasticity;Force control;Hydraulic actuators;Springs;Velocity control;Friction","legged locomotion;robot dynamics;research initiatives;electric actuators","MIT Leg Lab;dynamics;active control;walking robots;electromechanical actuators;control algorithms;legged locomotion;mobile robots","","57","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In the proposed control schemes, we need not derive the linear formulation of robot dynamic equation and tune the parameters. We also suggest the robust adaptive control laws in all proposed schemes for decreasing the effect of approximation error. To reduce the number of fuzzy rules of the FLS, we consider the properties of robot dynamics and the decomposition of the uncertainty function. The proposed controllers are robust not only to the structured uncertainty such as payload parameter, but also to the unstructured one such as friction model and disturbance. The validity of the control scheme is shown by computer simulations of a two-link planar robot manipulator.","1941-0034","","10.1109/91.842152","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=842152","","Adaptive control;Robots;Fuzzy control;Uncertainty;Orbital robotics;Robust control;Manipulator dynamics;Fuzzy logic;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Nonlinear equations","manipulators;adaptive control;fuzzy control;compensation;uncertain systems;robust control","fuzzy compensator;parametric uncertainties;FLS;fuzzy logic system;nonlinear function approximation;robust adaptive control laws;uncertainty function decomposition;structured uncertainty;payload parameter;friction model;disturbance;two-link planar robot manipulator","","168","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An analytical relationship between radial force and radial vibration is determined, which can be used to predict the noise power level at the frequency of operation. The vibration and sound are functions of machine dimensions, material properties, and rotational speed. The knowledge of the circumferential mode shapes of vibration, the natural mode frequencies of the stator, and the frequency spectrum of the radial magnetic force can be effectively utilized to design SRMs with minimal noise through geometrical design variations. The effect of the number of stator and rotor poles on acoustic noise can also be analyzed with the model presented in this paper.

Results show that most subjects failed to detect the fraud manipulations, albeit a few succeeded. The fraud has the effect of increasing the consumers' reliance in assurance mechanisms and trust mechanisms, which in turn decrease perceived risk and increase trust in the store.

The discrete short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is used for the time-frequency domain; dyadic and binary-tree wavelet filters for the time-scale domain. The theory is explained with special emphases on the analysis of voltage disturbance data. Dyadic wavelet filters are not suitable for the harmonic analysis of disturbance data. Filter center frequencies and bandwidths are inflexible, and the results do not give easy insight in the time behavior of the harmonics. On the other hand, band-pass filter outputs from discrete STFT are well associated with harmonics and are thus more useful for power system analysis. With a properly chosen window size, the discrete STFT is also able to detect and analyze transients in a voltage disturbance. Overall, the STFT is more suitable than wavelet filters for the analysis of power system voltage disturbance data.","1937-4208","","10.1109/61.891515","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=891515","","Time frequency analysis;Voltage;Power harmonic filters;Band pass filters;Power system harmonics;Power system transients;Wavelet analysis;Harmonic analysis;Power system analysis computing;Transient analysis","power system faults;time-frequency analysis;time-domain analysis;discrete Fourier transforms;wavelet transforms;power supply quality;power system harmonics;harmonic analysis","voltage disturbances;time-frequency domain analysis;time-scale domain analysis;discrete short-time Fourier transform;dyadic wavelet filters;binary-tree wavelet filters;harmonic analysis;filter center frequency;filter center bandwidth;band-pass filter outputs;power system analysis;window size","","216","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An excellent place to start learning scientific visualization is in the field of image processing, since it involves algorithms that help convert data into images. In today's technology-oriented world, the term 'image processing' generally refers to the processing of a two-dimensional data set using a computer. This was the main reason that the initial research was completed in the implementation of image processing techniques using a software called Advanced Visual Systems Express (AVS Express). There is a definite need to show how that would benefit instruction as a teaching aid, and also how it helps optimize the time taken to implement these different techniques using this software. It also increases user understanding of these techniques. It is possible to fully implement many of the different image processing techniques such as edge extraction, gradient operators, convolution, compression and extraction, as well as many others in a relatively short time. In comparison to previous attempts with other popular software such as MATLAB, the time difference proved to be immense. The main advantage of AVS software is that it provides a visual programming environment which allows the user to see the flow of information of the different algorithms as they are being implemented. Since no time is spent writing and correcting code, the understanding of the image processing techniques becomes much clearer in a shorter period of time, and thus in depth study is possible. We have developed a number of techniques and are in the process of integrating AVS Express into the curriculum for the Digital Image Processing (EE523) course at Tennessee State University as a teaching and study aid.","","0-7803-6312-4","10.1109/SECON.2000.845603","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=845603","","Education;Image processing;Data visualization;Image converters;Visual system;Convolution;Image coding;MATLAB;Programming environments;Software algorithms","image processing;teaching;educational courses;computer aided instruction;data visualisation;visual programming;programming environments","image processing techniques;teaching aid;understanding;scientific visualization;data representation;image processing;algorithms;2D data set;software;Advanced Visual Systems Express;AVS Express;edge extraction;gradient operators;convolution;image compression;MATLAB;AVS software;visual programming environment;curriculum;Digital Image Processing course;Tennessee State University;study aid","","7","","4","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Silicon, micromachined probes with multiple iridium oxide stimulating electrodes (400-1600 /spl mu/m/sup 2/) were implanted in guinea pig cortex. A 10-17 day post-operative recovery period was followed by five days of monopolar stimulation, two hours/electrode each day using biphasic constant current stimulation (5-100 /spl mu/A, 100 /spl mu/s/phase). EIS and CV data were taken before and after stimulation. The post stimulation impedance [at mid-range frequencies (100 Hz-100 kHz)] consistently and significantly decreased relative to prestimulation levels. Impedance magnitude increased permanently at low frequencies (<100 Hz), correlating to a change in the charge storage capacity (the area under a cyclic voltammagram). Impedance magnitude significantly increased during the recovery period, though this increase could be mostly reversed by applying small currents. A mathematical model of the electrode-tissue system impedance was used to analyze in vivo behavior. The data and modeling results shows that applying charge to the electrode can consistently reduce the impedance of the electrode-tissue system. Analysis of explanted probes suggests that the interaction between the tissue and electrode is dependent on whether chronic pulses were applied. It is hypothesized that the interface between the tissue and metal is altered by current pulsing, resulting in a temporary impedance shift.","1558-2531","","10.1109/10.846685","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=846685","","Transistors;Electrodes;Probes;Frequency;Impedance measurement;Electric variables measurement;Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy;Silicon;Mathematical model;In vivo","neurophysiology;iridium compounds;thin film devices;microelectrodes;brain;biological techniques;bioelectric phenomena;prosthetics","thin-film iridium oxide electrodes;chronic neural stimulation;electrode-tissue system electrical propeties;electrochemical impedance spectroscopy;cyclic voltammetry;silicon micromachined probes;multiple iridium oxide stimulating electrodes;guinea pig cortex;implanted microelectrodes;10 to 17 d;100 Hz to 100 kHz;2 h;5 to 100 muA;100 mus;IrO/sub 3/;Si","","192","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For example, given a video recording of a talking person, we would like to estimate a 3D model of the lips and the full face and its internal modes of variation. Many solutions that recover 3D shape from 2D image sequences have been proposed; these so-called structure-from-motion techniques usually assume that the 3D object is rigid. For example, C. Tomasi and T. Kanades' (1992) factorization technique is based on a rigid shape matrix, which produces a tracking matrix of rank 3 under orthographic projection. We propose a novel technique based on a non-rigid model, where the 3D shape in each frame is a linear combination of a set of basis shapes. Under this model, the tracking matrix is of higher rank, and can be factored in a three-step process to yield pose, configuration and shape. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model free approach that can recover from single-view video sequences nonrigid shape models. We demonstrate this new algorithm on several video sequences. We were able to recover 3D non-rigid human face and animal models with high accuracy.","1063-6919","0-7695-0662-3","10.1109/CVPR.2000.854941","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=854941","","Shape;Streaming media;Image sequences;Electrical capacitance tomography;Humans;Face;Video sequences;Animals;Matrix decomposition;Computer science","image sequences;video recording;image reconstruction;matrix algebra","non-rigid 3D shape recovery;image streams;3D non-rigid shape models;image sequences;video recording;talking person;3D model;2D image sequences;structure-from-motion techniques;linear combination;basis shapes;tracking matrix;three-step process;model free approach;single-view video sequences;nonrigid shape models;3D non-rigid human face recovery;animal models","","342","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The DCT is applied in blocks of 8/spl times/8 pixels, as in the JPEG algorithm. The watermark can encode information to track illegal misuses. For flexibility purposes, the original image is not necessary during the ownership verification process, so it must be modeled by noise. Two tests are involved in the ownership verification stage: watermark decoding, in which the message carried by the watermark is extracted, and watermark detection, which decides whether a given image contains a watermark generated with a certain key. We apply generalized Gaussian distributions to statistically model the DCT coefficients of the original image and show how the resulting detector structures lead to considerable improvements in performance with respect to the correlation receiver, which has been widely considered in the literature and makes use of the Gaussian noise assumption. As a result of our work, analytical expressions for performance measures, such as the probability of errors in watermark decoding and the probabilities of false alarms and of detection in watermark detection, are derived and contrasted with experimental results.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.817598","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=817598","","Watermarking;Discrete cosine transforms;Detectors;Decoding;Copyright protection;Digital images;Image analysis;Testing;Data mining;Gaussian distribution","copyright;discrete cosine transforms;copy protection;performance evaluation;signal detection;spread spectrum communication;Gaussian distribution;Gaussian noise;image coding;image sensors;image processing equipment","image watermarking technique;discrete cosine transform;still images;detector performance analysis;copyright protection;digital images;information encoding;illegal misuse tracking;flexibility;ownership verification;Gaussian noise;watermark decoding;message extraction;watermark detection;generalized Gaussian distributions;statistical model;detector structure;correlation receiver;error probability;false alarm probability;detection probability;signal detection;spread-spectrum communication","","452","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There exist all sorts of different demand management programs that utilities use. A critical issue is the incentive paid to the customer to participate in demand management programs and provide load relief. The utility has to design cost effective yet attractive demand management contracts. The main goal is to get load relief when needed, and to do so in a cost effective way. Customers sign up for programs when the benefits they derive in the form of up front payments, demand discounts and interruption payments exceed their cost of interruption. In order to design such contracts, mechanism design with the revelation principle is adopted from game theory and applied to the interaction between a utility and its customers. The idea behind mechanism design is to design an incentive structure that encourages customers to sign up for the right contract and reveal their true value of power (and thus, the value of power interruptibility).","1558-0679","","10.1109/59.898098","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=898098","","Contracts;Game theory;Pricing;Power system management;Energy management;Disaster management;Cost function;Load management;Power system security","demand side management;power system economics;game theory;contracts;tariffs;power system faults;power system security;electricity supply industry","demand management;incentive compatible contracts design;demand relief;load serving entity;up front payments;demand discounts;interruption payments;interruption costs;revelation principle;game theory;incentive structure","","159","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a result, securing group communications, i.e., providing confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of messages delivered between group members, will become a critical networking issue. We present, in this paper, a novel solution to the scalability problem of group/multicast key management. We formalize the notion of a secure group as a triple (U,K,R) where U denotes a set of users, K a set of keys held by the users, and R a user-key relation. We then introduce key graphs to specify secure groups. For a special class of key graphs, we present three strategies for securely distributing rekey messages after a join/leave and specify protocols for joining and leaving a secure group. The rekeying strategies and join/leave protocols are implemented in a prototype key server we have built. We present measurement results from experiments and discuss performance comparisons. We show that our group key management service, using any of the three rekeying strategies, is scalable to large groups with frequent joins and leaves. In particular, the average measured processing time per join/leave increases linearly with the logarithm of group size.","1558-2566","","10.1109/90.836475","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=836475","","Unicast;File servers;Authentication;Access protocols;Teleconferencing;Collaboration;Scalability;Prototypes;Particle measurements;Size measurement","protocols;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;graph theory;cryptography","secure group communications;key graphs;emerging network applications;confidentiality;authenticity;integrity;scalability problem;group/multicast key management;secure group;rekey messages;join/leave protocols;prototype key server;performance;processing time","","643","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Advanced gear-shifting and clutching strategy for a parallel-hybrid vehicle","Hyeoun-Dong Lee; Seung-Ki Sul; Han-Sang Cho; Jang-Moo Lee","Hyundai Motor Co., Kyunggi, South Korea; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Industry Applications Magazine","","2000","6","6","26","32","In parallel-hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), both the electric drive and the internal combustion engine provide driving torque to the wheels either separately or together. The electric drive also can be used as a generator to recharge the batteries when the engine produces more power than is needed to propel the vehicle. As a result of the battery peak power density requirement, the vehicle needs a multispeed transmission between the electric drive and the main differential. In addition, due to the load sharing between the two independent driving sources, a clutch to separate the internal combustion engine and electric drive from the drive shaft is also required. Because the shift quality is directly related to the driving comfort of the vehicle, it is important to reduce both shift shock and time. To enhance the shift quality, we have proposed the advanced gear-shifting and clutching strategy for a parallel-hybrid drive train with an automated manual transmission (AMT). By using the electronically controlled AMT, users can achieve the optimal gear shifting, with regard to the efficiency of the hybrid drive train. Owing to the speed control of the induction machine and the diesel engine at gear shifting, the synchronization is always guaranteed and it reduces the shift shock and shortens the shift time. The dynamo-based experiments have been carried out for the purpose of proving the validity of the proposed transmission and clutch control in parallel-hybrid drive trains.","1558-0598","","10.1109/2943.877837","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=877837","","Internal combustion engines;Vehicle driving;Diesel engines;Battery powered vehicles;Electric shock;Gears;Hybrid electric vehicles;Torque;Wheels;Power generation","electric vehicles;clutches;asynchronous machines","gear-shifting;clutching strategy;parallel-hybrid vehicle;electric drive;internal combustion engine;driving torque;battery peak power density;battery recharging;multispeed transmission;load sharing;independent driving sources;drive shaft;shift quality;gear shift shock reduction;gear shift time reduction;automated manual transmission;electronically controlled AMT;optimal gear shifting;induction machine speed control;diesel engine speed control;synchronization;dynamo-based experiments","","36","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The influence of different antennas (dipole, monopole, whip, and planar inverted F antenna) on the power absorption and on the consequent tissue heating has then been analyzed. The obtained results show for a radiated power of 600 mW, maximum SAR values, averaged over 1 g, from 2.2 to 3.7 W/kg depending on the considered phone.

"Digital rights management and watermarking of multimedia content for m-commerce applications","F. Hartung; F. Ramme","NA; NA","IEEE Communications Magazine","","2000","38","11","78","84","E-commerce has become a huge business and a driving factor in the development of the Internet. Online shopping services are well established and will, with the advent of evolved 2G and 3G mobile networks, soon be complemented by their wireless counterparts. Furthermore, online delivery of digital media, such as MP3 audio or video, is very popular today and will become an increasingly important part of e-commerce and mobile e-commerce (m-commerce). However, a major obstacle for digital media distribution and associated business is the possibility of unlimited consecutive copying in the digital domain, which threatens intellectual property rights (e.g., copyrights). Digital rights management systems are required to protect rights and business. DRM systems typically incorporate encryption, conditional access, copy control mechanisms, and media identification and tracing mechanisms. Watermarking is the technology used for copy control and media identification and tracing. Most proposed watermarking methods use a so-called spread spectrum approach: a pseudo-noise signal with small amplitude is added to the host signal, and later on detected using correlation methods. A secret key is used to ensure that the watermark can only be detected and removed by authorized parties. Thus, watermarking is an essential component of modern DRM systems. Several standardization bodies are involved in DRM standardization. Some examples, (MPEG-4, SDMI, and DVD), are discussed in this article. Watermarking as an enabling technology is especially highlighted. Furthermore, the relation between DRM and m-commerce, and the impact on business models for m-commerce are discussed. A common experience today is that Internet e-commerce applications cannot always easily be adapted for mobile telecommunications systems. We emphasize, however, that DRM and watermarking can benefit from the additional information available in mobile telecommunications systems, and can thus help to improve rights management for digital media delivery.","1558-1896","","10.1109/35.883493","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=883493","","Content management;Watermarking;Internet;Standardization;Digital audio players;Intellectual property;Protection;Cryptography;Control systems;Spread spectrum communication","copy protection;industrial property;multimedia communication;electronic commerce;standardisation;security of data;Internet;land mobile radio","digital rights management;digital watermarking;multimedia content;m-commerce applications;e-commerce;online shopping services;mobile networks;online delivery;digital media;MP3 audio;MP3 video;mobile e-commerce;digital media distribution;intellectual property rights;copyrights;business;encryption;conditional access;copy control mechanisms;media identification;tracing mechanisms;spread spectrum;secret key;DRM standardization","","101","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The purpose of the shunt active filter is to provide compensation currents such that the source needs to supply balanced (positive-sequence) fundamental source current at unity power factor even though the load consumes harmonic currents as well as positive, negative, and zero-sequence currents. A major feature of the proposed approach is that it does not require symmetrical component transformation to transform the three-phase voltages and currents to /spl alpha/-/spl beta/-o quantities. This makes practical implementation of the proposed method easier than the symmetrical component transformation approach. In addition, the power factor of the positive-sequence fundamental component is close to unity and only positive-sequence power is supplied by the source.

These savings are achieved largely due to the way electrical utilities bill their customers. Improvement of power factor can reduce power costs, release electrical capacity of the distribution system, raise the voltage level, and reduce the system losses. Using shunt capacitor banks for power factor correction (PFC) is a very well established approach. However, there are cautions and difficulties associated with using capacitors. When sizing and locating capacitors for PFC, many designers tend to base their calculations on maximizing the revenue from such installation by minimizing insulation cost and maximizing the energy savings. Fewer emphases are usually given to the potential adverse affects caused by interaction phenomena between PFC and some power system elements. Among the most common and potentially harmful phenomenon is the harmonic amplification that can result the presence of a resonance in the power system close to the frequency of a nearby harmonic source. This paper focuses on those phenomena ""other side of PFC"" that can cause significant damage and disruption to a given power system. The scope of the paper includes an outline on some available mathematical tools to analyze these phenomena and apply them on a study of an industrial power system.","","0-7803-6420-1","10.1109/PESS.2000.868713","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=868713","","Power factor correction;Power capacitors;Power system harmonics;Costs;Reactive power;Power system analysis computing;Industrial power systems;Voltage;Insulation;Resonance","power factor correction;power capacitors;distribution networks;power system harmonics;harmonic distortion","power factor correction capacitors;electrical installations;cost savings;electrical utilities;distribution system;voltage level;shunt capacitor banks;harmonic amplification;mathematical tools","","16","","4","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The synchronization is actually inherent in the implemented algorithm and does not require additional control loops; the stability problems affecting all the solutions proposed so far are, therefore, avoided and a steady switching frequency is achieved.

Contrasted to generators, static VAr compensators are designed specifically for transmission voltage regulation. The transmission voltage is directly regulated at high speed. Total SVC and medium voltage component reactive power ratings are referred to the transmission side.

In the scheme, the relay contains a fault transient detection system together with a communication unit, which is connected to the power line through the high voltage coupling capacitors of the CVT. Relays are installed at each busbar in a transmission network. These detect the fault generated high frequency voltage transient signals and record the time instant corresponding to when the initial travelling wave generated by the fault arrives at that busbar. The communication unit is used to transmit and receive coded digital signals of the local information to and from the associated relay(s) in the system. At each substation, the relays determine the location of the fault by comparing the GPS time stamps measured locally with those received from the adjacent substations.

No.00EX380)","","2000","","","35","38","The coaxially-fed U-slot rectangular patch antenna and the L-probe fed rectangular patch antenna are two recently developed single-layer single-patch wideband microstrip patch antennas. In both cases, a second resonance is introduced near the main patch resonance, either by the U-slot or by the L-probe. The U-slot or the L-probe also introduce a capacitance which counteracts the inductance of the coaxial feed, allowing for the use of thick substrates (0.08-0.1 /spl Lambda//sub 0/) where /spl Lambda//sub 0/ is the free space wavelength. Using foam substrates (with /spl epsiv//sub r//spl ap/1) the impedance bandwidths of these antennas operating in the fundamental mode are in the 30-40% range, with stable pattern and gain characteristics. These bandwidths are more than sufficient for most wireless communication applications. The resonant length of the fundamental mode is about half of the free space wavelength. For many applications, it is desirable to reduce the size of the patch to conserve real estate space. For this reason, there have been extensive investigations on patch size reduction techniques. One method uses microwave substrates with values of /spl epsiv//sub r/>1. Another method uses a shorting wall at the location of zero electric field so that the resonant length is halved, resulting in the quarter-wave patch. Yet another method uses a shorting pin near the feed. This introduces capacitive coupling to the patch resonance, thereby increasing the effective /spl epsiv//sub r/, and reducing the frequency, which means that, for a given resonant frequency, the patch size becomes smaller. In this paper, results of some of these investigations are presented.","","0-7803-5894-5","10.1109/APWC.2000.900136","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=900136","","Wideband;Resonance;Patch antennas;Coaxial components;Feeds;Bandwidth;Broadband antennas;Microstrip antennas;Capacitance;Inductance","microstrip antennas;slot antennas;antenna feeds","patch size reduction;coaxially-fed U-slot rectangular patch antenna;L-probe fed rectangular patch antenna;wideband patch antennas;wideband microstrip patch antennas;patch resonance;thick substrates;foam substrates;impedance bandwidth;wireless communication applications;resonant length;fundamental mode;free space wavelength;microwave substrates;shorting wall;quarter-wave patch;shorting pin;capacitive coupling;resonant frequency","","6","","2","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Modeling the optical behavior of the three-layer system allowed for the determination of the refractive index and absorption coefficient of parylene at these frequencies.

The representation in PCA is based on the second order statistics of the image set, and does not address higher order statistical dependencies such as the relationships among three or more pixels. Higher order statistics (HOS) have been used as a more informative low dimensional representation than PCA for face and vehicle detection. We investigate a generalization of PCA, kernel principal component analysis (kernel PCA), for learning low dimensional representations in the context of face recognition. In contrast to HOS, kernel PCA computes the higher order statistics without the combinatorial explosion of time and memory complexity. While PCA aims to find a second order correlation of patterns, kernel PCA provides a replacement which takes into account higher order correlations. We compare the recognition results using kernel methods with eigenface methods on two benchmarks. Empirical results show that kernel PCA outperforms the eigenface method in face recognition.","1522-4880","0-7803-6297-7","10.1109/ICIP.2000.900886","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=900886","","Face recognition;Kernel;Principal component analysis;Face detection;Higher order statistics;Pixel;Radio frequency;Vehicle detection;Object recognition;Support vector machines","face recognition;principal component analysis;object detection;tracking;correlation methods","kernel eigenfaces;face recognition;principal component analysis;PCA methods;face detection;face tracking;second order statistics;image set;pixels;higher order statistics;HOS;low dimensional representation;vehicle detection;kernel principal component analysis;kernel PCA;second order correlation","","98","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Cell search in W-CDMA","Y. -. E. Wang; T. Ottosson","Ericsson Inc., NC, USA; NA","IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","","2000","18","8","1470","1482","In a CDMA cellular system, the process of the mobile station searching for a cell and achieving code and time synchronization to its downlink scrambling code is referred to as cell search. Cell search is performed in three scenarios: initial cell search when a mobile station is switched on, idle mode search when inactive, and active mode search during a call. The latter two are also called target cell search. This paper presents algorithms and results for both initial and target cell search scenarios for the wideband CDMA (W-CDMA) standard. In W-CDMA, the cell search itself is divided into five acquisition stages: slot synchronization, frame synchronization and scrambling code group identification, scrambling code identification, frequency acquisition, and cell identification. Initial cell search needs all five stages, while target cell search in general does not need the last two stages. A pipelined process of the first three stages that minimizes the average code and time acquisition time, while keeping the complexity at a reasonable level, is considered. The frequency error in initial cell search, which may be as large as 20 kHz, is taken care of by partial symbol despreading and noncoherent combining. Optimization of key system parameters such as the loading factors for primary synchronization channel, synchronization channel, and common pilot channel for achieving the smallest average code and time acquisition time is studied. After code and time synchronization (the first three stages), a maximum likelihood (ML)-based frequency acquisition method is used to bring down the frequency error to about 200 Hz. The gain of this method is more than 10 dB compared to an alternative scheme that obtains a frequency error estimate using differential detection.","1558-0008","","10.1109/49.864011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=864011","","Multiaccess communication;Frequency synchronization;Frequency estimation;Base stations;Downlink;Wideband;Frequency conversion;Maximum likelihood detection;Transmitters;Maximum likelihood estimation","broadband networks;radio networks;code division multiple access;cellular radio;search problems;synchronization;radio links;optimization","W-CDMA;CDMA cellular system;target cell search;mobile station;time synchronization;code synchronization;downlink scrambling code;initial cell search;idle mode search;active mode search;algorithms;wideband CDMA standard;W-CDMA standard;slot synchronization;frame synchronization;scrambling code group identification;scrambling code identification;frequency acquisition;cell identification;pipelined process;complexity;frequency error;partial symbol despreading;noncoherent combining;system parameters optimisation;loading factors;primary synchronization channel;common pilot channel;maximum likelihood based frequency acquisition;differential detection;time acquisition;code acquisition","","98","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This system incorporates high-speed insulated gate bipolar transistor switching technology and was designed to provide the speed and efficiency required by industrial customers. Furthermore, the system will provide the flexibility of installation with or without the incorporation of tap-changing transformers.

Its primary advantage over tile original implementation is that it is a much faster calculation, currently requiring less than 30 sec execution time per bed position for an adult thorax, thus making clinical whole-body scatter correction more practical. The new code runs on a single processor workstation CPU instead of a vector processor array, making it highly portable. It is modular and independent of any particular reconstruction code. The computed scatter contribution is now intrinsically scaled relative to the emission image and no longer requires normalization to the scatter tails in the sinogram when all activity is contained within the field of view, making it more robust against noise. The new algorithm has been verified against the original code on both phantom and human thorax studies. Initial results indicate that scatter correction may be accurately performed following, instead of prior to, either 3D reprojection or Fourier rebinning. Some evidence is presented that the single-scatter operator, when applied to an uncorrected emission image provides reasonable compensation for multiple scatter.","1558-1578","","10.1109/23.873020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=873020","","Scattering;Positron emission tomography;Whole-body PET;Workstations;Vector processors;Image reconstruction;Noise robustness","positron emission tomography;gamma-ray scattering;medical image processing","faster image-based scatter correction;3D PET;single processor workstation CPU;vector processor array;Fourier rebinning;phantom studies;human thorax studies;nuclear medicine;medical diagnostic imaging;30 s","","368","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main contribution of the paper is that the analysis accounts for fading of the signal of interest (SOI) as well as the cochannel interference (CCI). The paper considers BPSK signalling in flat, quasi-static channels. Rayleigh or Rice fading is assumed for the SOI, while CCI is assumed subject to Rayleigh fading. Channels associated with interference sources are assumed independent and identically distributed. Using a multivariate statistical analysis approach and assuming equal-power interference sources, analytical expressions are derived for the density function of the array output signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), the outage probability, and the average probability of bit error with maximal ratio combining. Earlier results obtained for optimum combining and Rayleigh fading are extended to the case when the SOI is subject to Rice fading.

Kolding","RF Integrated Syst. & Circuits Group, Aalborg Univ., Denmark","IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","","2000","47","4","734","740","In this paper, a de-embedding method is proposed for conducting accurate on-wafer device measurements in the gigahertz range. The method addresses issues of substrate coupling and contact effects and is therefore suitable for measurements with lossy technologies such as CMOS. The method assumes a probe-tip two-port calibration performed with well-known techniques and impedance substrates. By employing a physical interpretation of the test-fixture, the method alleviates a number of known problems with common de-embedding procedures.

In this paper, the lossless line model is modified to account for the series losses in the line. The line model equations are then solved in the time domain to accurately locate the fault. Testing of the modified algorithm is performed on a power system belonging to the Western Area Power Administration.

Non-thermal plasmas in which the mean energy of the electrons is substantially higher than that of the gas offer advantages in reducing the energy required to remove the pollutants. The electrical energy supplied into the discharge is used preferentially to create energetic electrons which are then used to produce radicals by dissociation and ionization of the carrier gas in which the pollutants are present. These radicals are used to decompose the pollutants. There are two technologically promising techniques for generating non-thermal plasmas in atmospheric gas pressure containing the pollutants, namely electron beam irradiation and electrical discharge techniques. Both techniques are undergoing intensive and continuous development worldwide. This is done to reduce the energy requirement for pollutant removal, and therefore the associated cost, as well as to obtain a better understanding of the physical and chemical processes involved in reducing the pollutants. In the present paper only electrical discharge techniques are reviewed and emphasis is given to the more recent published work. The paper summarizes the chemical reactions responsible for the removal of the major polluting constituents of NO, NO/sub 2/ and SO/sub 2/ encountered in flue gases and exhaust emissions. The constructional features of the various types of electrical discharge reactors commonly employed in the removal of gas pollutants as well as pilot systems used in industrial plants are described briefly The results on the removal efficiency of the various pollutants including hydrocarbons and volatile compounds and their dependency on the type of discharge reactor, the type and the magnitude of the applied voltage (dc, ac and pulsed), the polarity of the voltage (de and pulsed), the effect of the pulse width, the initial concentration of the pollutants, the addition of ammonia, argon and other hydrocarbons, the gas flow rate, the residence time of the pollutants in the discharge reactor, the gas temperature and on the type of the gas constituents will be reviewed. The removal of pollutants using arc plasmas will be discussed. The specific energy density which is supplied in various forms of electrical discharges to reduce the pollutants is discussed. The energy required to remove the pollutants is expected to be one of the main considerations in selecting the technology to be used to remove the pollutants and therefore it is of prime importance.","1558-4135","","10.1109/94.879361","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=879361","","Air pollution;Environmentally friendly manufacturing techniques;Industrial pollution;Inductors;Space vector pulse width modulation;Electrons;Hydrocarbons;Voltage;Plasma temperature;Fault location","air pollution control;dissociation;discharges (electric);legislation","air pollution control;national legislation;nonthermal plasmas;energetic electrons;dissociation;ionization;atmospheric gas pressure;chemical reactions;polluting constituents;flue gases;exhaust emissions;industrial plants;hydrocarbons;volatile compounds;discharge reactor;polarity;pulse width;gas flow rate;residence time;gas temperature;gas constituents;energy density;NO;NO/sub 2/;SO/sub 2/","","221","","114","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In general, this is a valid assumption that reduces the design complexity. However the fact that a power switch does have a finite resistance means that there will be a nonzero voltage across it during its on time. This voltage can be taken advantage of. This paper proposes a simple control technique that utilizes the variable resistance of the power MOSFET in a dc-dc converter. This is the first switched mode power supply that uses the power switch in more than two states or operating points. It is also the first switched mode power supply that uses the power switch as a variable control device as well as a power device. A 48-5-V 20-W forward converter is implemented to confirm the theory and demonstrate its practicality.

Loss allocation factors computed from the proposed schemes are specific to location and time of use. This is especially important for EG whose impact on losses varies in time and space. A notable feature of the proposed loss allocation coefficients is that they can be positive or negative and therefore can recognise the presence of counter-flows such as those due to the presence of EG.

The main difference between accurate and simple models is that the former need only a few SPICE simulations to properly evaluate model parameters. The simple models show errors which are always lower than 20%, while accurate models have typical errors of 2%. Design optimization is in terms of bias currents giving minimum propagation delay, and it has been demonstrated that at the cost of a 10% increase in propagation delay we can reduce power dissipation by 40%.

In this paper, seven methods of resonant-load control are compared for their ability to improve performance in the presence of a low-frequency (100 Hz) lightly damped resonance. The seven methods are: notch filter, bi-quad filter, rigid body observers, low-pass filter, observer filtering, active resonance damping and center-of-mass control. Several of the methods are based on filtering the command signal; the remaining methods are based on signals acquired from an observer. Development of these methods is presented; each method is applied to a physical system and evaluated for effects on command response and dynamic stiffness.","0197-2618","0-7803-6401-5","10.1109/IAS.2000.882073","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=882073","","Resonance;Load flow control;Industrial control;Servomechanisms;Couplings;Control systems;Frequency;Velocity control;Torque;Damping","servomotors;motor drives;load regulation;notch filters;observers;low-pass filters;biquadratic filters;damping;resonance;machine control","resonant load control methods;industrial servo drives;mechanical load resonance;performance improvement;low-frequency lightly damped resonance;notch filter;bi-quad filter;rigid body observers;low-pass filter;observer filtering;active resonance damping;center-of-mass control;command signal filtering;100 Hz","","77","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two different approaches have been considered, In the first approach, at least one thoracic signal is used as the a prior to perform the classification whereas in the second approach no thoracic signal is needed, A reconstruction method is utilized to obtain the fetal ECG signal from the detected fetal modulus maxima. The proposed technique is different from the classical time-domain methods, in that we exploit the most distinct features of the signal, leading to more robustness with respect to signal perturbations.

The paper focuses on the extended Kalman filter frequency tracker, which is the application of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) framework to the frequency estimation problem. The EKF frequency tracker recently proposed in the literature is characterized by a vector of three design parameters {q,r,/spl epsi/}, whose role and tuning is still a controversial and unclear issue. In this paper it is shown that a wise parametrization of the extended Kalman frequency tracker is characterized by just one parameter: the /spl epsi/ must be set to zero to achieve the basic property of unbiasedness in a noise-free setting; the performances of the tracker are not influenced independently by q and r; and what really matters is the ratio /spl lambda/=r/q only. The proposed simplification of the extended Kalman filter frequency tracker allows an easier and more transparent tuning of its tracking behavior.","1558-2523","","10.1109/9.880631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=880631","","Frequency estimation;Equations;Tuning;Power harmonic filters;Noise measurement;White noise;Kalman filters;Signal to noise ratio;Harmonic analysis;Parameter estimation","Kalman filters;frequency estimation;tracking;harmonic analysis","parametrization;Kalman filter;frequency tracking;harmonic signal;frequency estimation;parameter estimation","","146","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The amplitude estimation techniques discussed in this paper do not model the observation noise, and yet, they are all asymptotically statistically efficient. It is, however, their different finite-sample properties that are of particular interest to this study.

In this approach, a data set is considered as an image with each light point located at a datum position. As we blur this image, smaller light blobs merge into larger ones until the whole image becomes one light blob at a low enough level of resolution. By identifying each blob with a cluster, the blurring process generates a family of clustering along the hierarchy. The advantages of the proposed approach are: 1) The derived algorithms are computationally stable and insensitive to initialization and they are totally free from solving difficult global optimization problems. 2) It facilitates the construction of new checks on cluster validity and provides the final clustering a significant degree of robustness to noise in data and change in scale. 3) It is more robust in cases where hyperellipsoidal partitions may not be assumed. 4) it is suitable for the task of preserving the structure and integrity of the outliers in the clustering process. 5) The clustering is highly consistent with that perceived by human eyes. 6) The new approach provides a unified framework for scale-related clustering algorithms derived from many different fields such as estimation theory, recurrent signal processing on self-organization feature maps, information theory and statistical mechanics, and radial basis function neural networks.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.895974","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=895974","","Signal processing algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Humans;Eyes;Noise robustness;Filtering;Pattern recognition;Image processing;Image analysis;Pattern analysis","pattern clustering;physiological models;visual perception;image processing;parameter estimation;filtering theory","scale-space filtering;cluster analysis;visual system;data clustering;blurring effect;lateral retinal interconnections;light blobs;cluster validity;degree of robustness;outliers;scale-related clustering algorithms;estimation theory;recurrent signal processing;self-organization feature maps;information theory;statistical mechanics","","186","","39","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"General fuzzy min-max neural network for clustering and classification","B. Gabrys; A. Bargiela","Dept. of Comput., Nottingham Trent Univ., UK; NA","IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","","2000","11","3","769","783","This paper describes a general fuzzy min-max (GFMM) neural network which is a generalization and extension of the fuzzy min-max clustering and classification algorithms of Simpson (1992, 1993). The GFMM method combines supervised and unsupervised learning in a single training algorithm. The fusion of clustering and classification resulted in an algorithm that can be used as pure clustering, pure classification, or hybrid clustering classification. It exhibits a property of finding decision boundaries between classes while clustering patterns that cannot be said to belong to any of existing classes. Similarly to the original algorithms, the hyperbox fuzzy sets are used as a representation of clusters and classes. Learning is usually completed in a few passes and consists of placing and adjusting the hyperboxes in the pattern space; this is an expansion-contraction process. The classification results can be crisp or fuzzy. New data can be included without the need for retraining. While retaining all the interesting features of the original algorithms, a number of modifications to their definition have been made in order to accommodate fuzzy input patterns in the form of lower and upper bounds, combine the supervised and unsupervised learning, and improve the effectiveness of operations. A detailed account of the GFMM neural network, its comparison with the Simpson's fuzzy min-max neural networks, a set of examples, and an application to the leakage detection and identification in water distribution systems are given.","1941-0093","","10.1109/72.846747","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=846747","","Fuzzy neural networks;Neural networks;Fuzzy sets;Pattern recognition;Clustering algorithms;Unsupervised learning;Pattern classification;Fuzzy systems;Humans;Classification algorithms","pattern clustering;pattern classification;fuzzy neural nets;minimax techniques;learning (artificial intelligence)","general fuzzy min-max neural network;GFMM neural network;clustering;classification;supervised learning;unsupervised learning;training algorithm;decision boundaries;hyperbox fuzzy sets;expansion-contraction process;lower bounds;upper bounds;leakage detection;leakage identification;water distribution systems","","220","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper describes an all-digital technique that significantly mitigates this problem. The technique continuously measures and cancels the portion of the ADC error arising from DAC noise during normal operation of the ADC, so no special calibration signal or auto-calibration phase is required. The details of the technique are described in the context of a nominal 14-bit pipelined ADC example at both the signal processing and register transfer levels. Through this example, the paper demonstrates that in the presence of realistic component matching limitations the technique can improve the overall ADC accuracy by several bits with only moderate digital hardware complexity.","1558-125X","","10.1109/82.826744","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=826744","","Noise cancellation;Analog-digital conversion;Digital-analog conversion;Pipelines;Noise measurement;Phase measurement;Phase noise;Calibration;Signal processing;Hardware","pipeline processing;analogue-digital conversion;digital-analogue conversion;integrated circuit noise;CMOS integrated circuits","digital cancellation;D/A converter noise;DAC noise;pipelined A/D converters;pipelined ADC;analog-to-digital converters;component mismatches;internal DACs;all-digital technique;ADC error;signal processing level;register transfer level;ADC accuracy improvement;14 bit","","96","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The theoretical efficiency of the LINC power amplifier has been reported as 100% since highly efficient nonlinear constant amplitude amplifiers can be used. However, the 100% efficiency performance is only possible at one or two loads along the power output curve. The bulk of the papers regarding LINC has focused on clever implementations of the signal vector decomposition as well as methods to achieve highly linear signal separation. There has been little regard in the literature to the signal combiner implementation necessary to achieve the high power-added efficiency (PAE) of the LINC radio frequency (RF) power amplifier. Efficiency is not an intrinsic property of the combiner implementations, however, the combiner method is the single biggest contributor to efficient performance of a LINC RF power amplifier. This paper develops an analysis method that determines the efficiency of the LINC power amplifier as a function of the amplitude modulation statistics. This can be employed to design the RF communication system amplitude modulation characteristics and to tradeoff and optimize the RF transmitter PAE.","1939-9359","","10.1109/25.820715","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=820715","","Power amplifiers;Optimization methods;Radio frequency;High power amplifiers;Radiofrequency amplifiers;Vectors;Amplitude modulation;Source separation;RF signals;Statistical analysis","amplitude modulation;power amplifiers;power combiners;circuit optimisation;radio transmitters;radiofrequency amplifiers","LINC power amplifier combiner method;efficiency optimization;linear amplification using nonlinear components;vector summing;constant amplitude phase-modulated signals;power amplification;theoretical efficiency;signal vector decomposition;linear signal separation;signal combiner implementation;high power-added efficiency;RF power amplifier;amplitude modulation statistics;100 percent","","52","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Kovacs-Vajna","DEA, Brescia Univ., Italy","IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","","2000","22","11","1266","1276","An effective fingerprint verification system is presented. It assumes that an existing reference fingerprint image must validate the identity of a person by means of a test fingerprint image acquired online and in real-time using minutiae matching. The matching system consists of two main blocks: The first allows for the extraction of essential information from the reference image off-line, the second performs the matching itself online. The information is obtained from the reference image by filtering and careful minutiae extraction procedures.

The article gives an overview of text-to-speech (TTS) technology and a description of some issues of potential interest to speech coding experts. After motivation for the use of TTS technology, it describes the general architecture of a text-to-speech system with particular emphasis on the speech synthesis component. Both formant synthesis and concatenative synthesis are presented, offering different degrees of flexibility and quality. Several well-known speech coding techniques (including LPC vocoders, waveform interpolation, harmonic coding, and layered coding) have been used in speech synthesis. It explains how they have been applied, and the advantages and limitations of those techniques when used in speech synthesis. The main goal is to increase cooperation between the speech coding community and the TTS community, and in particular to motivate the need for speech coding algorithms that meet the requirements of the next generation speech synthesis technology.","","0-7803-6416-3","10.1109/SCFT.2000.878372","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=878372","","Speech synthesis;Speech coding;Linear predictive coding;Vocoders;Interpolation","speech synthesis;speech coding;linear predictive coding;vocoders;interpolation","text-to-speech synthesis;text-to-speech technology;text-to-speech system architecture;speech synthesis;formant synthesis;concatenative synthesis;speech quality;LPC vocoders;waveform interpolation;harmonic coding;layered coding;speech coding algorithms;speech synthesis technology","","1","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Analytical results are found for the discontinuous mode boundaries and for the steady-state characteristics when one of the outputs operates in discontinuous conduction mode. Three basic approaches to coupled-inductor design are compared: near-ideal coupling, practical moderate coupling, and the zero-ripple approach. It is shown that the best cross regulation can be obtained via the zero-ripple approach with relatively loose coupling in applications where there is at least one output whose load current variations are relatively small so that all windings can always operate in continuous conduction mode.

The integrated model is divided into three parts, the supply system model, the nonlinear load model and the controller model. First, the supply system is represented by a set of linear differential equations. Simulation is achieved by a numerical method and the measurements are taken as the control input. Secondly, based on the arc melting process and typical arc furnace V-I characteristic, the arc furnace load is described as a current-controlled nonlinear resistance. The pattern of nonlinear resistance is controlled by the average arc length, which reflects the arc furnace operating condition. Finally, the rectangular approximation of arc voltage is adopted by the controller to generate the arc power-arc length and the arc current-arc length curves. This information combined with the arc furnace operation and measurement information is used for the control scheme to determine the arc length and arc furnace transformer tap. Thus, the proposed adaptive arc furnace model is suitable for different operating conditions. This model is also compared prith the existing arc furnace models, which provides its validity.

This is an adaptation of concepts for scalability measures in parallel computing. Scalability is measured by the range of scale factors that give a satisfactory value of the metric, and good scalability is a joint property of the initial design and the scaling strategy. The results give insight into the scaling capacity of the designs, and into how to improve the design. A rapid simple bound on the metric is also described.

It is shown that the error in the propagation delay if inductance is neglected and the interconnect is treated as a distributed RC line can be over 35% for current on-chip interconnect. It is also shown that the traditional quadratic dependence of the propagation delay on the length of the interconnect for RC lines approaches a linear dependence as inductance effects increase. On-chip inductance is therefore expected to have a profound effect on traditional high-performance integrated circuit (IC) design methodologies. The closed-form delay model is applied to the problem of repeater insertion in RLC interconnect. Closed-form solutions are presented for inserting repeaters into RLC lines that are highly accurate with respect to numerical solutions. RC models can create errors of up to 30% in the total propagation delay of a repeater system as compared to the optimal delay if inductance is considered. The error between the RC and RLC models increases as the gate parasitic impedances decrease with technology scaling.

With the blurs satisfying a certain co-primeness condition in addition, we establish existence and uniqueness results which guarantee that single input/multiple-output FIR blurred images can be restored blindly, though perfectly in the absence of noise, using linear FIR filters. Results of simulations employing the blind order determination, blind blur identification, and blind image restoration algorithms are presented.

Several locomotives can be moving along the power distribution line at the same time, and depending on the distance between them, the interaction changes. The power consumption also changes, depending on operating modes. During normal operation, energy is consumed from the network, but as modern locomotives use electrical braking, the power flow changes direction during deceleration, and energy is delivered back to the grid.

This antenna is a modified version of the conducting slotline bowtie hybrid (SBH) antenna with resistive sheets (Rcards) introduced into the guiding structure design. Since the resistive sheets can attenuate creeping wave fields, much smaller rolled edges are needed in the Rcard SBH antenna. Moreover, due to the Rcard's partially transparent nature with respect to electromagnetic fields, the radar cross section (RCS) associated with this new antenna is smaller than the original conducting rolled edge one. By employing an optimization process based on the concept of the genetic algorithm, one can easily design the Rcard SBH antenna to obtain a very stable antenna beamwidth and phase center in both the E- and H-planes across the entire operating frequency bandwidth. Because of its constant beamwidth, low RCS, and broad-band features, the Rcard SBH antenna is an ideal antenna for many applications such as a compact range feed. Calculated and measured results are presented to demonstrate the performance of this new antenna.","1558-2221","","10.1109/8.901273","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=901273","","Horn antennas;Ultra wideband antennas;Slot antennas;Antenna feeds;Slotline;Electromagnetic fields;Radar cross section;Radar antennas;Design optimization;Genetic algorithms","horn antennas;slot antennas;genetic algorithms;slot line components;radar cross-sections;electromagnetic fields;antenna feeds","ultrawide-bandwidth antenna;tapered resistive TEM horn antenna;stable beamwidth antenna;low-scattering antenna;conducting slotline bowtie hybrid antenna;resistive sheets;guiding structure design;creeping wave fields attenuation;electromagnetic fields;radar cross section;RCS;optimization;genetic algorithm;phase center;H-plane;E-plane;frequency bandwidth;compact range feed;antenna performance;measured results;feeding structure;rolled edge section","","37","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Cluster adaptive training of hidden Markov models","M. J. F. Gales","IBM Thomas J. Watson Res. Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, USA","IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","","2000","8","4","417","428","When performing speaker adaptation, there are two conflicting requirements. First, the speaker transform must be powerful enough to represent the speaker. Second, the transform must be quickly and easily estimated for any particular speaker. The most popular adaptation schemes have used many parameters to adapt the models to be representative of an individual speaker. This limits how rapidly the models may be adapted to a new speaker or the acoustic environment. This paper examines an adaptation scheme requiring very few parameters, cluster adaptive training (CAT). CAT may be viewed as a simple extension to speaker clustering. Rather than selecting a single cluster as representative of a particular speaker, a linear interpolation of all the cluster means is used as the mean of the particular speaker. This scheme naturally falls into an adaptive training framework. Maximum likelihood estimates of the interpolation weights are given. Furthermore, simple re-estimation formulae for cluster means, represented both explicitly and by sets of transforms of some canonical mean, are given. On a speaker-independent task CAT reduced the word error rate using very little adaptation data. In addition when combined with other adaptation schemes it gave a 5% reduction in word error rate over adapting a speaker-independent model set.","1558-2353","","10.1109/89.848223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=848223","","Hidden Markov models;Loudspeakers;Interpolation;Maximum likelihood linear regression;Error analysis;Databases;Maximum likelihood estimation;Speech recognition;Power system modeling;Robustness","hidden Markov models;adaptive systems;speech recognition;interpolation;maximum likelihood estimation;transforms;pattern clustering","cluster adaptive training;hidden Markov models;speaker adaptation;speaker transform;acoustic environment;linear interpolation;cluster means;maximum likelihood estimates;interpolation weights;re-estimation formulae;canonical mean;speaker-independent task;word error rate reduction;speaker-independent model set;speech recognition","","152","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The emphasis is on an engineering approach intended to facilitate rapid estimation of oscillator phase noise.

We propose a novel sensor cell architecture to obtain high sensitivity, wide output dynamic range, and contrast adjustment. For the architecture, three circuit techniques were developed. A sensing circuit with a differential charge-transfer amplifier enhances sensitivity while it suppresses the influence of the parasitic capacitance of the sensor plate. A wide output dynamic range, which is needed for high-resolution analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion, is achieved by transforming the sensed voltage to a time-variant signal. Finally, the sensing circuit includes an automatic contrast enhancement scheme that uses a variable-threshold Schmitt trigger circuit to distinguish the ridges and valleys of a fingerprint well. The characteristics of a test chip using the 0.5-/spl mu/m CMOS process show a high sensitivity to less than 80 fF as the detected signal, while the variation of the output signal is suppressed to less than 3% at /spl plusmn/20% variation of the parasitic capacitance. The dynamic range of the time-variant signal is 70 /spl mu/s, which is wide enough for A/D conversion. The automatic contrast enhancement scheme widens the time-variant signal 100 /spl mu/s more.

The algorithms are based on a closed form solution for finding the scaling function spectrum from the wavelet spectrum. Many applications require wavelets that are matched to a signal of interest. Most current design techniques, however, do not design the wavelet directly. They either build a composite wavelet from a library of previously designed wavelets, modify the bases in an existing multiresolution analysis or design a scaling function that generates a multiresolution analysis with some desired properties. In this paper, two sets of equations are developed that allow us to design the wavelet directly from the signal of interest. Both sets impose bandlimitedness, resulting in closed form solutions. The first set derives expressions for continuous matched wavelet spectrum amplitudes. The second set of equations provides a direct discrete algorithm for calculating close approximations to the optimal complex wavelet spectrum. The discrete solution for the matched wavelet spectrum amplitude is identical to that of the continuous solution at the sampled frequencies. An interesting byproduct of this work is the result that Meyer's spectrum amplitude construction for an orthonormal bandlimited wavelet is not only sufficient but necessary. Specific examples are given which demonstrate the performance of the wavelet matching algorithms for both known orthonormal wavelets and arbitrary signals.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.887001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=887001","","Signal design;Algorithm design and analysis;Closed-form solution;Wavelet analysis;Multiresolution analysis;Equations;Continuous wavelet transforms;Discrete wavelet transforms;Libraries;Frequency","wavelet transforms;bandlimited signals;spectral analysis;matched filters","mother wavelet;signal of interest;orthonormal Riesz basis;closed form solution;scaling function spectrum;wavelet spectrum;design techniques;bandlimitedness;continuous matched wavelet spectrum amplitudes;direct discrete algorithm;close approximations;optimal complex wavelet spectrum;discrete solution;matched wavelet spectrum amplitude;continuous solution;Meyer spectrum amplitude construction;orthonormal bandlimited wavelet;performance;wavelet matching algorithms;matched filter","","93","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In conventional tissue classification for a scalar volume, tissues of interest are characterized by an opacity transfer function defined as a one-dimensional (1D) function of the original volume intensity. To overcome the limitations inherent in conventional 1D opacity functions, we propose a tissue classification method that employs a multidimensional opacity function, which is a function of the 3D derivative features calculated from a scalar volume as well as the volume intensity. Tissues of interest are characterized by explicitly defined classification rules based on 3D filter responses highlighting local structures, such as edge, sheet, line, and blob, which typically correspond to tissue boundaries, cortices, vessels, and nodules, respectively, in medical volume data. The 3D local structure filters are formulated using the gradient vector and Hessian matrix of the volume intensity function combined with isotropic Gaussian blurring. These filter responses and the original intensity define a multidimensional feature space in which multichannel tissue classification strategies are designed. The usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparisons with conventional single-channel classification using both synthesized data and clinical data acquired with CT (computed tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanners. The improvement in image quality obtained using multichannel classification is confirmed by evaluating the contrast and contrast-to-noise ratio in the resultant volume-rendered images with variable opacity values.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.856997","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=856997","","Biomedical imaging;Multidimensional systems;Filters;Data visualization;Pipelines;Transfer functions;Computed tomography;Magnetic resonance imaging;Medical diagnostic imaging;Information filtering","biological tissues;rendering (computer graphics);image classification;medical image processing;computerised tomography;biomedical MRI;stereo image processing;feature extraction","tissue classification;3D local intensity structures;volume rendering;3D derivative features;opacity transfer function;1D function;volume intensity;3D filter responses;local structures;tissue boundaries;cortices;vessels;nodules;3D local structure filters;gradient vector;Hessian matrix;isotropic Gaussian blurring;clinical data;CT;MRI;image quality;contrast-to-noise ratio;contrast","","234","","39","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This model can describe the statistics of the envelope of the backscattered echo from an ensemble of scatterers with varying number densities, varying cross sections, and the presence or absence of regularly spaced scatterers. Computer simulations and experiments on tissue-mimicking phantoms have been undertaken to test the validity of the model. Results clearly show the versatility of the Nakagami distribution and its parameter to model the backscattered envelope from tissues.

DSP has become a key component in many consumer, communications, medical, and industrial products, which use a variety of hardware approaches to implement DSP, ranging from the use of off-the-shelf microprocessors to field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to custom integrated circuits (ICs). Programmable ""DSP processors"", a class of microprocessors optimized for DSP, are a popular solution for several reasons: they can potentially be reprogrammed in the field, allowing product upgrades or fixes. They are often more cost-effective (and less risky) than custom hardware, particularly for low-volume applications, where the development cost of custom ICs may be prohibitive. In comparison to other types of microprocessors, DSP processors often have an advantage in terms of speed, cost, and energy efficiency. In this article, we trace the evolution of DSP processors from early architectures to current state-of-the-art devices. We highlight some of the key differences among architectures and compare their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we discuss the growing class of general-purpose processors that have been enhanced to address the needs of DSP applications.","1558-0792","","10.1109/79.826411","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=826411","","Digital signal processing;Microprocessors;Hardware;Field programmable gate arrays;Costs;Communication industry;Application specific integrated circuits;Energy efficiency","digital signal processing chips;microprocessor chips;field programmable gate arrays;application specific integrated circuits","digital signal processing;consumer products;communication products;medical products;industrial products;off-the-shelf microprocessors;field-programmable gate arrays;custom integrated circuits;programmable DSP processors;microprocessors;development cost;energy efficiency;speed;general-purpose processors;DSP applications","","66","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

It is proposed that the power-law form of Rent's rule, which predicts the number of terminals required by a group of gates for communication with the rest of the circuit, is a consequence of a statistically homogeneous circuit topology and gate placement. The term ""homogeneous"" is used to imply that quantities such as the average wire length per gate and the average number of terminals per gate are independent of the position within the circuit. Rent's rule is used to derive a variety of net length distribution models and the approach adopted in this paper is to factor the distribution function into the product of an occupancy probability distribution and a function which represents the number of valid net placement sites. This approach places diverse placement models under a common framework and allows the errors introduced by the modeling process to be isolated and evaluated. Models for both planar and hierarchical gate placement are presented.","1557-9999","","10.1109/92.902258","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=902258","","Wire;Very large scale integration;Circuit topology;Distribution functions;Probability distribution;Printed circuits;Large scale integration;Equations;Convergence;Physics computing","circuit layout CAD;integrated circuit layout;logic CAD;logic arrays;ULSI;integrated circuit modelling;wiring","Rent's rule;placement models;power-law form;statistically homogeneous circuit topology;gate placement;average wire length;net length distribution models;occupancy probability distribution;modeling process","","151","","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Automatic monitoring offers the promise of substantially reducing the cost of repair and replacement of defective parts, and may even result in saving lives. Current processing for prognostic health monitoring (PHM) uses relatively simple metrics or features and rules to measure and characterize changes in sensor data. An alternative solution is to use neural nets coupled with appropriate feature extractors. We have developed techniques that couple neural nets with automated rule extractors to form systems that have: good statistical performance; easy system explanation and validation; potential new data insights and new rule discovery, novelty detection; and real-time performance. We apply these techniques to data sets data collected from operating engines. Prognostic examples using the integrated system are shown and compared with current PHM system performance. Rules for performing the prognostics will be developed and the rule performance compared.","1095-323X","0-7803-5846-5","10.1109/AERO.2000.877892","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=877892","","Turbines;Engines;Condition monitoring;Prognostics and health management;Neural networks;Data mining;Aircraft propulsion;Computerized monitoring;Costs;Current measurement","gas turbines;aerospace engines;automatic testing;feature extraction;data mining;neural nets;fault location;aerospace computing;statistical analysis;diagnostic expert systems","gas turbine engines;engine maintainers;automatic detection;classification;prediction;critical component failures;automatic monitoring;cost of repair;defective parts;prognostic health monitoring;feature extractors;statistical performance;data mining;rule extraction;exhaustive search;training data;automated rule extractors;TREPAN;fuzzy logic;integrated prognosis","","50","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Automated feature recognition has been an active research area in solid modeling for many years and is considered to be a critical component for integration of CAD and computer-aided manufacturing. The paper gives an overview of the state-of-the-art in feature recognition research.

Because of node mobility and power limitations, the network topology changes frequently. Routing protocols therefore play an important role in mobile multihop network communications. A trend in ad hoc network routing is the reactive on-demand philosophy where routes are established only when required. Most of the protocols in this category, however, use a single route and do not utilize multiple alternate paths. We propose a scheme to improve existing on-demand routing protocols by creating a mesh and providing multiple alternate routes. Our algorithm establishes the mesh and multipaths without transmitting any extra control message.

"Fast, reliable head tracking under varying illumination: an approach based on registration of texture-mapped 3D models","M. La Cascia; S. Sclaroff; V.

The head is modeled as a texture mapped cylinder. Tracking is formulated as an image registration problem in the cylinder's texture map image. The resulting dynamic texture map provides a stabilized view of the face that can be used as input to many existing 2D techniques for face recognition, facial expressions analysis, lip reading, and eye tracking. To solve the registration problem with lighting variation and head motion, the residual registration error is modeled as a linear combination of texture warping templates and orthogonal illumination templates. Fast stable online tracking is achieved via regularized weighted least-squares error minimization. The regularization tends to limit potential ambiguities that arise in the warping and illumination templates. It enables stable tracking over extended sequences. Tracking does not require a precise initial model fit; the system is initialized automatically using a simple 2D face detector. It is assumed that the target is facing the camera in the first frame. The formulation uses texture mapping hardware. The nonoptimized implementation runs at about 15 frames per second on a SGI O2 graphic workstation. Extensive experiments evaluating the effectiveness of the formulation are reported. The sensitivity of the technique to illumination, regularization parameters, errors in the initial positioning, and internal camera parameters are analyzed. Examples and applications of tracking are reported.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.845375","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=845375","","Lighting;Head;Target tracking;Face detection;Cameras;Image registration;Face recognition;Image texture analysis;Detectors;Hardware","face recognition;tracking;image registration;stability;image texture;least squares approximations","fast reliable head tracking;varying illumination;texture-mapped 3D model registration;texture mapped cylinder;face recognition;facial expression analysis;lip reading;eye tracking;residual registration error;texture warping templates;orthogonal illumination templates;fast stable online tracking;regularized weighted least-squares error minimization;illumination template;SGI O2 graphic workstation;illumination sensitivity;regularization parameter sensitivity;error sensitivity;internal camera parameters sensitivity","","350","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Requirements engineering processes often result in goals, requirements, and assumptions about agent behavior that are too ideal; some of them are likely not to be satisfied from time to time in the running system due to unexpected agent behavior. The lack of anticipation of exceptional behaviors results in unrealistic, unachievable, and/or incomplete requirements. As a consequence, the software developed from those requirements will not be robust enough and will inevitably result in poor performance or failures, sometimes with critical consequences on the environment. This paper presents formal techniques for reasoning about obstacles to the satisfaction of goals, requirements, and assumptions elaborated in the requirements engineering process. The techniques are based on a temporal logic formalization of goals and domain properties; they are integrated into an existing method for goal-oriented requirements elaboration with the aim of deriving more realistic, complete, and robust requirements specifications. A key principle is to handle exceptions at requirements engineering time and at the goal level, so that more freedom is left for resolving them in a satisfactory way. The various techniques proposed are illustrated and assessed in the context of a real safety-critical system.","1939-3520","","10.1109/32.879820","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=879820","","Humans;Robustness;Software systems;Software performance;Logic;Software engineering;Stress;Face;Dispatching","formal specification;systems analysis;temporal logic;safety-critical software;exception handling","goal-oriented requirements engineering;formal specification;unexpected agent behavior;software performance;software failure;temporal logic;requirements specifications;exception handling;safety-critical system","","335","","88","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The framework is based on the idea of the Nash bargaining solution from cooperative game theory, which not only provides the rate settings of users that are Pareto optimal from the point of view of the whole system, but are also consistent with the fairness axioms of game theory. We first consider the centralized problem and then show that this procedure can be decentralized so that greedy optimization by users yields the system optimal bandwidth allocations. We propose a distributed algorithm for implementing the optimal and fair bandwidth allocation and provide conditions for its convergence. The paper concludes with the pricing of elastic connections based on users' bandwidth requirements and users' budget.

However, the analysis and design of the RPWM mechanisms are generally not so trivial for practical engineers that their applications are limited. In this paper, a random frequency PWM (RFPWM) inverter and its practical design procedure are presented. First, the effects of the attributes of a random signal on the inverter output harmonic spectrum distribution characteristics are analyzed using an intuitive concept, then based on which, the quantitative design. Simulink simulation and implementation of the proposed RFPWM inverter are introduced. The proposed RFPWM inverter is employed to power an indirect field-oriented induction motor drive.

The subcarriers are phase modulated by M different sequences that constitute a complementary set. Such a set can be constructed, for example, from the M cyclic shifts of a perfect phase-coded sequence of length M (e.g. P4). The subcarriers are separated by the inverse of the duration of a phase element t/sub b/, yielding orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), well known in communications. A single pulse of such a signal exhibits a thumbtack ambiguity function with delay resolution of t/sub b//M. The power spectrum is relatively flat, with width of M/t/sub b/. The signal can be constructed by power combining M fixed-amplitude signals. The resulting signal, however, is of variable amplitude. The peak-to-mean envelope power ratio can be maintained below 2.

International Symposium on Product Quality and Integrity (Cat. No.00CH37055)","","2000","","","216","221","During the design phase of a product, reliability engineers are called upon to evaluate the reliability of the system. The question of how to meet a reliability goal for the system arises when the estimated reliability is inadequate. This then becomes a reliability allocation problem at the component level. In this paper, a general model estimates the minimum reliability requirement for multiple components within a system that will yield the goal reliability value for the system. The model consists of two parts. The first part is a nonlinear programming formulation of the allocation problem. The second part is a cost function formulation to be used in the nonlinear programming algorithm. A general behavior of the cost as a function of a component's reliability is assumed for this matter. The system's cost is then minimized by solving for an optimum component reliability, which satisfies the system's reliability goal requirement. Once the reliability requirement for each component is estimated, one can then decide whether to achieve this reliability by fault tolerance or fault avoidance. The model has yielded very encouraging results and it can be applied to any type of system, simple or complex, and for a variety of distributions. The advantage of this model is that it is very flexible, and requires very little processing time. These advantages make the proposed reliability allocation solution a great system design tool.

As a result, it is crucial that power/performance tradeoffs be made more visible to chip architects and even compiler writers, in addition to circuit designers. Most existing power analysis tools achieve high accuracy by calculating power estimates for designs only after layout or floorplanning are complete. In addition to being available only late in the design process, such tools are often quite slow, which compounds the difficulty of running them for a large space of design possibilities. This paper presents Wattch, a framework for analyzing and optimizing microprocessor power dissipation at the architecture-level. Wattch is 1000X or more faster than existing layout-level power tools, and yet maintains accuracy within 10% of their estimates as verified using industry tools on leading-edge designs. This paper presents several validations of Wattch's accuracy. In addition, we present three examples that demonstrate how architects or compiler writers might use Wattch to evaluate power consumption in their design process. We see Wattch as a complement to existing lower-level tools; it allows architects to explore and cull the design space early on, using faster, higher-level tools. It also opens up the field of power-efficient computing to a wider range of researchers by providing a power evaluation methodology within the portable and familiar SimpleScalar framework.","1063-6897","1-58113-232-8","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=854380","","Energy consumption;Power dissipation;Microprocessors;Circuits;Process design;Portable computers;Cooling;Permission;Accuracy;Embedded computing","microprocessor chips;power consumption;computer architecture;circuit CAD","power analysis;power dissipation;power/performance tradeoffs;power analysis tools;Wattch;microprocessor power dissipation;architecture-level;power consumption","","1042","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To reduce the computational cost of BLAST, we develop an efficient square-root algorithm for the nulling and cancellation step. The main features of the algorithm include efficiency: the computational cost is reduced by 0.7 M, where M is the number of transmit antennas, and numerical stability: the algorithm is division-free and uses only orthogonal transformations. In a 14 antenna system designed for transmission of 1 Mbit/s over a 30 kHz channel, the nulling and cancellation computation is reduced from 190 MFlops/s to 19 MFlops/s, with the overall computations being reduced from 220 MFlops/s to 49 MFlops/s.

It works in performance similar to the continuous fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) and can be efficiently calculated by the FFT. Since the continuous FRFT can be generalized into the continuous affine Fourier transform (AFT) (the so-called canonical transform), we also extend the DFRFT into the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT). We derive two types of the DFRFT and DAFT. Type 1 is similar to the continuous FRFT and AFT and can be used for computing the continuous FRFT and AFT. Type 2 is the improved form of type 1 and can be used for other applications of digital signal processing. Meanwhile, many important properties continuous FRFT and AFT are kept in the closed-form DFRFT and DAFT, and some applications, such as filter design and pattern recognition, are also discussed.

Experiments have been conducted on a database consisting of 500 images taken from multicolored man-made objects in real world scenes. From the theoretical and experimental results it is concluded that object retrieval based on composite color and shape invariant features provides excellent retrieval accuracy. Object retrieval based on color invariants provides very high retrieval accuracy whereas object retrieval based entirely on shape invariants yields poor discriminative power.

The number of reflection peaks of a Bragg grating at around 1.55 /spl mu/m is 19 for highly multimode excitation and 3-4 for lower order mode excitation. We analyze the phase-matching conditions of the propagating modes and identify half of the reflection peaks as the reflection to the same mode and the rest as the reflection to the neighboring modes. In dispersion-shifted fiber, a Bragg grating at around 0.8 /spl mu/m in three-mode propagation shows three reflection peaks in the reflection spectrum.

For this aim, two psychophysical experiments have been conducted. The first experiment consisted of a compliance discrimination, between two virtual springs hand-operated by means of the Spaceball/sup TM/. In this experiment, the stiffness (or compliance) JND turned out to be 6%. The second experiment assessed stiffness discrimination between a virtual spring and the equivalent spring in reality. In this case, the stiffness (or compliance) JND was found to be 13.4%. These results are consistent with previous outcomes on manual discrimination of compliance. Consequently, this consistency reveals that the passive apparatus that was used can, to some extent, simulate haptic information. In addition, a final test indicated that the proprioceptive sense of the subjects was blurred by visual feedback. This gave them the illusion of using a nonisometric device.","1087-8270","0-7695-0478-7","10.1109/VR.2000.840369","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=840369","","Force feedback;Electrical capacitance tomography;Springs;Psychology;Electronic switching systems;Haptic interfaces;Testing;Human computer interaction;Software prototyping;Prototypes","force feedback;haptic interfaces;interactive devices;psychology","pseudo-haptic feedback;force feedback simulation;passive isometric input device;Spaceball;visual feedback;psychophysical experiments;compliance discrimination;hand-operated virtual springs;stiffness JND;stiffness discrimination;proprioceptive sense","","92","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Binary partition trees concentrate in a compact and structured representation a set of meaningful regions that can be extracted from an image.

As shown in this paper, this representation can be used for a large number of processing goals such as filtering, segmentation, information retrieval and visual browsing. Furthermore, the processing of the tree representation leads to very efficient algorithms. Finally, for some applications, it may be interesting to compute the binary partition tree once and to store it for subsequent use for various applications.

For dual-frequency operation, the proposed design is achieved by loading two pairs of narrow slots in the triangular patch, one embedded close to the side edges of the patch and the other inserted at the bottom edge of the patch. The obtained two operating frequencies are of same polarization planes and by varying the positions and lengths of the inserted slots at the bottom edge of the patch, a tunable frequency ratio of the two frequencies ranging from about 1.16 to 2.06 is obtained. Furthermore, it is found that by protruding a narrow slot out of the embedded slots close to the side edges, broad-band operation of the triangular microstrip antenna near its fundamental resonant mode can be achieved. Results show that the antenna bandwidth of the proposed broad-band design can be greater than 2.6 times that of a conventional triangular microstrip antenna. Details of the proposed dual-frequency and broad-band designs are described and typical experimental results are presented and discussed.","1558-2221","","10.1109/8.876323","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=876323","","Microstrip antennas;Slot antennas;Loaded antennas;Bandwidth;Polarization;Resonance;Resonant frequency;Marine technology;Antenna radiation patterns","microstrip antennas;antenna accessories;multifrequency antennas;UHF antennas;antenna radiation patterns","dual-frequency design;broad-band designs;slot-loaded equilateral triangular microstrip antennas;operating frequencies;polarization plane;tunable frequency ratio;narrow slot;embedded slots;fundamental resonant mode;UHF;SHF;1600 to 3580 MHz","","46","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Propagation modeling over terrain using the parabolic wave equation","D. J. Donohue; J. R. Kuttler","Appl. Phys. Lab., Johns Hopkins Univ., Laurel, MD, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","","2000","48","2","260","277","We address the numerical solution of the parabolic wave equation over terrain using the Fourier/split-step approach. The method, referred to as a shift map, generalizes that of Beilis and Tappert (1979) who introduced a coordinate transformation technique to flatten the boundary. This technique is extended to a wide-angle form, allowing larger propagation angles with respect to the horizon. A new impedance boundary condition is derived for electromagnetic waves incident on a finitely conducting surface that enables solution of the parabolic wave (PWE) using the previously developed mixed Fourier transform. It is also shown by example that in many cases of interest, the boundary may be approximated by discrete piecewise linear segments without affecting the field solution. A more accurate shift map solution of the PWE for a piecewise linear boundary is, therefore, developed for modeling propagation over digitally sampled terrain data. The shift-map solution is applied to various surface types, including ramps, wedges, curved obstacles, and actual terrain. Where possible, comparisons are made between the numerical solution and an exact analytical form. The examples demonstrate that the shift map performs well for surface slopes as large as 10-15/spl deg/ and discontinuous slope changes on the order of 15-20/spl deg/. To accommodate a larger range of slopes, it is suggested that the most viable solution for general terrain modeling is a hybrid of the shift map with the well-known terrain masking (knife-edge diffraction) approximation.","1558-2221","","10.1109/8.833076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=833076","","Partial differential equations;Piecewise linear approximation;Piecewise linear techniques;Electromagnetic propagation;Surface impedance;Boundary conditions;Electromagnetic scattering;Surface waves;Fourier transforms;Diffraction","parabolic equations;Fourier transforms;piecewise linear techniques;rough surfaces;UHF radio propagation;microwave propagation","propagation modeling;terrain;parabolic wave equation;numerical solution;split-step approach;shift map;wide-angle form;coordinate transformation;propagation angles;impedance boundary condition;electromagnetic waves;finitely conducting surface;mixed Fourier transform;discrete piecewise linear segments;piecewise linear boundary;digitally sampled terrain data;surface types;ramps;wedges;curved obstacles;actual terrain;surface slopes;terrain masking;knife-edge diffraction","","100","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The principle of the alternating direction implicit (ADI) technique that has been used in formulating an unconditionally stable two-dimensional FDTD is applied. Unlike the conventional ADI algorithms, however, the alternation is performed in respect to mixed coordinates rather than to each respective coordinate direction, Consequently, only two alternations in solution marching are required in the 3-D formulations. Theoretical proof of the unconditional stability is shown and numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the method. It is found that the number of iterations with the proposed FDTD can be at least four times less than that with the conventional FDTD at the same level of accuracy.","1557-9670","","10.1109/22.869007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=869007","","Finite difference methods;Time domain analysis;Stability;Maxwell equations;Bandwidth;Spatial resolution;Electromagnetic fields;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Computational modeling","finite difference time-domain analysis;numerical stability;electromagnetic field theory","three-dimensional FDTD method;unconditional stability;finite-difference time-domain method;alternating direction implicit technique;ADI algorithm;mixed coordinates;3D FDTD method;EM problems","","433","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Voice Control system is reliable, speaker independent, and has a total added hardware price tag of under $50.00 per station. In contrast to traditional voice recognition systems, operator training is not required. OO-ALC has developed a general-purpose internal interface (Voice Control) to the Speech Recognition and Text-To-Speech engines provided by Microsoft. Voice Control can be accessed by any 32-bit Windows software, which has windows messaging capability. This is available to standard programming languages such as LabWindows CVI, Borland or Microsoft C/C++, Visual Basic, or even commercial packages such as Lotus Notes and Microsoft Word. Through Voice Control, the computer uses both video and voice prompts to request input from the operator. The operator is allowed to enter data and to control the software flow by voice command or from the keyboard or mouse. The Voice Control system allows for dynamic specification of a grammar set, or legal set of commands. The use of a reduced grammar set greatly increases recognition accuracy. The computer voice enables the operator to focus his attention away from the computer screen, which is required for activities such as probing a circuit card and taking readings. When the operator takes readings, the computer, to insure reliable entry, echoes his voice entries. With electronic tuning, speech synthesis allows the operator to hear the resulting reading, enabling him to focus on the circuit card instead of constantly turning his head to see the computer screen. This paper describes the capability and functionality of the Voice Control system.","1557-959X","","10.1109/62.821658","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=821658","","Computer interfaces;Speech recognition;Speech synthesis;Control systems;Circuits;Software design;Control system synthesis;Force control;Software testing;System testing","automatic test software;speech synthesis;speech-based user interfaces;speech recognition","hands-free computer interface;voice recognition;speech synthesis;Voice Control system;F-16 Analog Test Station Sustainment;general-purpose internal interface;text-to-speech engines;speech recognition;windows messaging capability;voice prompts;video prompts;dynamic specification;reduced grammar set;computer voice;electronic tuning;FATSS upgrade;portability;hardware requirements;Windows-based ATE","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This paper outlines an algorithm suitable for this task that makes use of kernel-based BRDF models. Intrinsic land surface albedos are derived, which may be used to derive actual albedo by taking into account the prevailing distribution of diffuse skylight. Spectral-to-broadband conversion is achieved using band-dependent weighting factors. The validation of a suitable BRDF model, the semiempirical Ross-Li (reciprocal RossThick-LiSparse) model and its performance under conditions of sparse angular sampling and noisy reflectances are discussed, showing that the retrievals obtained are generally reliable. The solar-zenith angle dependence of albedo may be parameterized by a simple polynomial that makes it unnecessary for the user to be familiar with the underlying BRDF model. The algorithm given is that used for the production of a BRDF/albedo standard data product from NASA's EOS-MODIS sensor, for which an at-launch status is provided. Finally, the algorithm is demonstrated on combined AVHRR and GOES observations acquired over New England, from which solar zenith angle-dependent albedo maps with a nominal spatial resolution of 1 km are derived in the visible band. The algorithm presented may be employed to derive albedo from space-based multiangular measurements and also serves as a guide for the use of the MODIS BRDF/albedo product.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.841980","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=841980","","Atmospheric modeling;Reflectivity;Bidirectional control;Distribution functions;Land surface;Sampling methods;Polynomials;Production;Spatial resolution;MODIS","geophysical techniques;remote sensing;terrain mapping;albedo","geophysical measurement technique;land surface;terrain mapping;satellite remote sensing;optical imaging;algorithm;retrieval;albedo;semiempirical model;BRDF;spectral albedo;multiangular reflectance observations;inversion;bidirectional reflectance distribution function;angular integration;diffuse skylight;spectral-to-broadband conversion;band-dependent weighting factor;semiempirical Ross-Li model;reciprocal RossThick-LiSparse model;visible","","622","","90","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The asymptotic performance of unitary root-MUSIC is analyzed and compared with that of conventional root-MUSIC. The results of this comparison show identical asymptotic properties of both algorithms in the case of uncorrelated sources and a better performance of unitary root-MUSIC in scenarios with partially correlated or fully coherent sources. Additionally, our simulations and the results of sonar and ultrasonic real data processing demonstrate an improved threshold performance of unitary root-MUSIC relative to conventional root-MUSIC.

The input currents are controlled using a switching state sequence showing minimum switching losses. A multi-loop system control is realized by an outer output voltage controller and an inner-loop buck+boost inductor current controller. Furthermore active damping of the input filter resonance is provided. For increasing the output power of the system a parallel connection of two interleaved units is proposed.

The measurements were performed using micromachined heatable test structures containing the layers to be characterized. The /spl kappa/ values of thermally grown silicon oxides are reduced from bulk fused silica by roughly 20%. The /spl kappa/ of phosphosilicate and borophosphosilicate glasses are 0.94/spl plusmn/0.08 W m/sup -1/ K/sup -1/ and 1.18/spl plusmn/0.06 W m/sup -1/ K/sup -1/, respectively, at 300 K.

This value is between published data for atmospheric-pressure CVD and low-pressure CVD nitrides. For the metal layers, we found thermal conductivities between 167 W m/sup -1/ K/sup -1/ and 206 W m/sup -1/ K/sup -1/, respectively, at 300 K, to be compared with 238 W m/sup -1/ K/sup -1/ of bulk aluminum.

The method can be applied in both position and rate control modes, with arbitrary motion or force scaling. No acceleration measurements are required. Nonlinear rigid-body dynamics of the master and the slave robots are considered. A model of the flexible or rigid environment is incorporated into the dynamics of the slave, while a model of the human operator is incorporated into the dynamics of the master. The master and the slave are subject to independent adaptive motion/force controllers that assume parameter uncertainty bounds. Each parameter is independently updated within its known lower and upper bounds. The states of the master (slave) are sent to the slave (master) as motion/force tracking commands instead of control actions (efforts and/or flows). Under the modeling assumptions for the human operator and the environment, the proposed teleoperation control scheme is L/sub 2/ and L/sub /spl infin// stable in both free motion and flexible or rigid contact motion and is robust against time delays. The controlled master-slave system behaves essentially as a linearly damped free-floating mass. If the parameter estimates converge, the environment impedance and the impedance transmitted to the master differ only by a control-parameter dependent mass/damper term.

In analogy to projection pursuit, EP seeks to learn an optimal basis for the dual purpose of data compression and pattern classification. It should increase the generalization ability of the learning machine as a result of seeking the trade-off between minimizing the empirical risk encountered during training and narrowing the confidence interval for reducing the guaranteed risk during testing. It therefore implements strategies characteristic of GA for searching the space of possible solutions to determine the optimal basis. It projects the original data into a lower dimensional whitened principal component analysis (PCA) space. Directed random rotations of the basis vectors in this space are searched by GA where evolution is driven by a fitness function defined by performance accuracy (empirical risk) and class separation (confidence interval). Accuracy indicates the extent to which learning has been successful, while separation gives an indication of expected fitness. The method has been tested on face recognition using a greedy search algorithm. To assess both accuracy and generalization capability, the data includes for each subject images acquired at different times or under different illumination conditions. EP has better recognition performance than PCA (eigenfaces) and better generalization abilities than the Fisher linear discriminant (Fisherfaces).","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.862196","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=862196","","Face recognition;Principal component analysis;Testing;Pattern classification;Machine learning;Genetic algorithms;Image coding;Data compression;Lighting;Displays","face recognition;evolutionary computation;image representation;image classification;image coding;data compression;generalisation (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence);genetic algorithms;principal component analysis","evolutionary pursuit;face recognition;EP;adaptive representation method;image encoding;image classification;optimal basis;data compression;pattern classification;generalization ability;learning machine;empirical risk minimization;confidence interval narrowing;GA;low-dimensional whitened principal component analysis;PCA;directed random vector rotations;class separation;greedy search algorithm;eigenfaces;generalization abilities;Fisher linear discriminant;Fisherfaces","","200","","43","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The second preprocessing by principal component analysis can further reduce the dimensionality of the input space and/or select input features that minimize diagnostic errors. Input normalization removes large dynamic variances over one or more dimensions in input space, which tend to obscure the relevant data fed to the neural network.

"A generalized RAKE receiver for interference suppression","G. E. Bottomley; T. Ottosson; Y. -. E. Wang","Ericsson Inc., NC, USA; NA; NA","IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","","2000","18","8","1536","1545","Currently, a global third-generation cellular system based on code-division multiple-access (CDMA) is being developed with a wider bandwidth than existing second-generation systems. The wider bandwidth provides increased multipath resolution in a time-dispersive channel, leading to higher frequency-selectivity. A generalized RAKE receiver for interference suppression and multipath mitigation is proposed. The receiver exploits the fact that time dispersion significantly distorts the interference spectrum from each base station in the downlink of a wideband CDMA system. Compared to the conventional RAKE receiver, this generalized RAKE receiver may have more fingers and different combining weights. The weights are derived from a maximum likelihood formulation, modeling the intracell interference as colored Gaussian noise. This low-complexity detector is especially useful for systems with orthogonal downlink spreading codes, as orthogonality between own cell signals cannot be maintained in a frequency-selective channel. The performance of the proposed receiver is quantified via analysis and simulation for different dispersive channels, including Rayleigh fading channels. Gains on the order of 1-3.5 dB are achieved, depending on the dispersiveness of the channel, with only a modest increase in the number of fingers. For a wideband CDMA (WCDMA) system and a realistic mobile radio channel, this translates to capacity gains of the order of 100%.","1558-0008","","10.1109/49.864017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=864017","","Fading;Multipath channels;Interference suppression;Multiaccess communication;Bandwidth;Frequency;RAKE receivers;Downlink;Wideband;Fingers","radio receivers;radiofrequency interference;interference suppression;cellular radio;code division multiple access;multiuser channels;dispersive channels;multipath channels;radio networks;broadband networks;radio links;Gaussian noise;spread spectrum communication;signal detection;Rayleigh channels;channel capacity","interference suppression;generalized RAKE receiver;global third-generation cellular system;code-division multiple-access;CDMA;bandwidth;second-generation systems;multipath resolution;time-dispersive channel;frequency-selectivity;multipath mitigation;interference spectrum distortion;base station;downlink;wideband CDMA system;combining weights;maximum likelihood formulation;intracell interference;colored Gaussian noise;low-complexity detector;orthogonal downlink spreading codes;frequency-selective channel;performance;simulation;Rayleigh fading channels;mobile radio channel;capacity gains","","136","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Tarn","Robotics North America Inc., Rochester, MI, USA; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","","2000","8","4","635","645","The paper is devoted to the problem of controlling a robot manipulator for a class of constrained motions. The task under consideration is to control the manipulator, such that the end-effector follows a path on an unknown surface, with the aid of a single camera assumed to be uncalibrated with respect to the robot coordinates. To accomplish a task of this kind, we propose a new control strategy based on multisensor fusion. We assume that three different sensors-that is, encoders mounted at each joint of the robot with six degrees of freedom, a force-torque sensor mounted at the wrist of the manipulator, and a visual sensor with a single camera fixed to the ceiling of the workcell-are available. Also, we assume that the contact point between the tool grasped by the end-effector and the surface is frictionless. To describe the proposed algorithm that we have implemented, first we decouple the vector space of control variables into two subspaces. We use one for controlling the magnitude of the contact force on the surface and the other for controlling the constrained motion on the surface. This way, the control synthesis problem is decoupled and we are able to develop a new scheme that utilizes sensor fusion to handle uncalibrated parameters in the workcell, wherein the surface on which the task is to be performed is assumed to be visible, but has an a priori unknown position.","1558-0865","","10.1109/87.852909","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=852909","","Force control;Robot sensing systems;Manipulators;Robot kinematics;Motion control;Robot vision systems;Cameras;Robot control;Wrist;Force sensors","sensor fusion;force control;position control;force sensors;robot vision;image sensors;motion control;control system synthesis;Jacobian matrices;manipulators","sensor-based hybrid position/force control;uncalibrated environment;constrained motions;end-effector;multisensor fusion;force-torque sensor;frictionless contact point;constrained motion;control synthesis problem","","104","","55","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The author outlines how the international standards community has responded to this need by introducing IEC 62040-3 which distinguishes three types of UPS topology: passive standby, line interactive, and double conversion. These three topologies are described. For low power ratings (less than 2 kVA) all three topologies, as defined by the standards, are used. For medium to high power ratings, the case for the passive standby and the line interactive is, at best, marginal, in spite of their significantly lower cost. The vast majority of sales to medium to high-power rating applications are represented by double conversion UPSs (95% from a few kVA upwards; 98% above 10 kVA). The dominance of the double-conversion topology is attributable to its almost total lack of weaknesses, combined with the capacity to meet the needs of sensitive loads at these power ratings-a consequence of UPS being connected in series with the utility power sources.","0953-5683","","10.1049/ir:20000204","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=844643","","","uninterruptible power supplies","UPS topologies;IEC standard;uninterruptible power supplies;international standards community;IEC 62040-3;UPS topology;passive standby UPS;line interactive UPS;double conversion UPS","","54","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals"

A comparison is made between three models of external disturbance time variation; a piecewise-constant-in-time model is found to be sufficient.

The derating of transformers has been defined such that for the (apparent, real) power transfer of a transformer the total losses are identical to the rated losses at rated temperature. A relation between apparent power, derating and K-factor is given taking into account iron-core and stray-power losses.

Eng., Duke Univ., Durham, NC, USA","IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","","2000","48","9","1420","1429","The ionosphere plays a role in radio propagation that varies strongly with frequency. At extremely low frequency (ELF: 3-3000 Hz) and very low frequency (VLF: 3-30 kHz), the ground and the ionosphere are good electrical conductors and form a spherical Earth-ionosphere waveguide. Many giants of the electromagnetics (EMs) community studied ELF-VLF propagation in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide, a topic which was critically important for long-range communication and navigation systems. James R. Wait was undoubtedly the most prolific publisher in this field, starting in the 1950s and continuing well into the 1990s. Although it is an old problem, there are new scientific and practical applications that rely on accurate modeling of ELF-VLF propagation, including ionospheric remote sensing, lightning remote sensing, global climate monitoring, and even earthquake precursor detection. The theory of ELF-VLP propagation in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide is mature, but there remain many ways of actually performing propagation calculations. Most techniques are based on waveguide mode theory with either numerical or approximate analytical formulations, but direct finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) modeling is now also feasible. Furthermore, in either mode theory or FDTD, the ionospheric upper boundary can be treated with varying degrees of approximation. While these approximations are understood in a qualitative sense, it is difficult to assess in advance their applicability to a given propagation problem. With a series of mode theory and FDTD simulations of propagation from lightning radiation in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide, we investigate the accuracy of these approximations. We also show that fields from post-discharge ionospheric currents and from evanescent modes become important at lower ELF (/spl lsim/500 Hz) over short distances (/spl lsim/500 km). These fields are not easily modeled with mode theory, but are inherent in the FDTD formulation of the problem. In this way, the FDTD solution bridges the gap between analytical solutions for fields close to and far from the source.","1558-2221","","10.1109/8.898776","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=898776","","Electromagnetic modeling;Electromagnetic propagation;Electromagnetic waveguides;Finite difference methods;Time domain analysis;Optical propagation;Frequency;Remote monitoring;Waveguide theory;Ionosphere","Earth-ionosphere waveguide;radiowave propagation;finite difference time-domain analysis;modal analysis;waveguide theory;lightning","Earth-ionosphere waveguide;electromagnetic propagation modeling;radio propagation;extremely low frequency;very low frequency;spherical Earth-ionosphere waveguide;ionospheric remote sensing;lightning remote sensing;ELF-VLF propagation;global climate monitoring;earthquake precursor detection;finite-difference time-domain;waveguide mode theory;FDTD;ionospheric upper boundary;post-discharge ionospheric currents;evanescent modes;numerical analysis;approximate analytical formulations;lightning radiation","","146","","43","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The basis of discussion is a ""nullification"" process, which can be described effectively in terms of the ideal circuit element nullor. The initial focus is on differential-mode noise cancellation, but the basic technique can be applied equally to cancelling common-mode noise.

AI techniques have made inroads to power electronics and drives to give more user-friendly, efficient, and improved dynamic performance, and robust and intelligent products. AI is basically embedding human intelligence into a machine so that it can think like a human being. AI is superior to human intelligence in some aspects. The computer with embedded AI techniques can process problems extremely fast compared to human beings; it can work continuously without tiring, and its problem-solving capability is not-affected by emotions and other human shortcomings. Advanced control based on artificial intelligence techniques is called intelligent control. Unlike classical control, intelligent control strategy may not need the mathematical model of the plant. Intelligent control can be visualized as a type of adaptive control.

The results are presented for both conventional and step-lap joints. The results illustrate the benefits of the step-lap joint in reducing core losses, noise and excitation current. The results also explain the impact of overlap length, the number of laminations per step, and the contribution of the joint region to the whole core performance. The calculated flux density wave shapes in the joint region were found to be in good agreement with measured wave shapes.

The difference in performance between low- and high-resolution tests with SVM was only 1%, demonstrating robustness and relative scale invariance for visual classification.","","0-7695-0580-5","10.1109/AFGR.2000.840651","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=840651","","Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Testing;Humans;Pixel;Image databases;Visual databases;Error analysis;Image resolution;Robustness","face recognition;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);image resolution","support vector machines;visual gender classification;thumbnail faces;FERET face database;performance;image resolution;scale invariance","","123","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Features computed based on gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GCMs) are used to evaluate the effectiveness of textural information possessed by mass regions in comparison with the textural information present in mass margins. A method involving polygonal modeling of boundaries is proposed for the extraction of a ribbon of pixels across mass margins. Two gradient-based features are developed to estimate the sharpness of mass boundaries in the ribbons of pixels extracted from their margins. A total of 54 images (28 benign and 26 malignant) containing 39 images from the Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) database and 15 images from a local database are analyzed. The best benign versus malignant classification of 82.1%, with an area (A/sub z/) of 0.85 under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve, was obtained with the images from the MIAS database by using GCM-based texture features computed from mass margins. The classification method used is based on posterior probabilities computed from Mahalanobis distances. The corresponding accuracy using jack-knife classification was observed to be 74.4%, with A/sub x/=0.67. Gradient-based features achieved A/sub x/=0.6 on the MIAS database and A/sub z/=0.76 on the combined database.

This new framework has the potential of dramatically improve the capacity and data rates. In addition, this framework presents the best trade-off between spectral efficiency and power consumption. ST codes (designed so far) come in two different types. ST trellis codes offer the maximum possible diversity gain and a coding gain without any sacrifice in the transmission bandwidth. The decoding of these codes, however, would require the use of a vector form of the Viterbi decoder. Space-time block codes (STBCs) offer a much simpler may of obtaining transmit diversity without any sacrifice in bandwidth and without requiring huge decoding complexity. In fact, the structure of the STBCs is such that it allows for very simple signal processing (linear combining) for encoding/decoding, differential encoding/detection, and interference cancellation. This new signal processing framework offered by ST codes can be used to enhance the data rate and/or capacity in various wireless applications. That is the reason many of these STC ideas have already found their way to some of the current third-generation wireless systems standards.","1558-0792","","10.1109/79.841731","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=841731","","Decoding;Signal processing;Bandwidth;Wireless communication;Receiving antennas;Energy consumption;Convolutional codes;Diversity methods;Vectors;Viterbi algorithm","data communication;signal processing;block codes;trellis codes;cellular radio;personal communication networks;channel capacity;decoding;differential detection;radiofrequency interference;interference suppression;multipath channels;diversity reception","data rate;wireless channels;space-time coding;signal processing;wireless communication systems;multiple transmit antennas;multiple receive antennas;channel capacity;spectral efficiency;power consumption;ST codes;ST trellis codes;diversity gain;coding gain;transmission bandwidth;decoding;Viterbi decoder;space-time block codes;transmit diversity;decoding complexity;linear combining;encoding/decoding;differential encoding/detection;interference cancellation;wireless applications;third-generation wireless systems standards;cellular radio;PCS;multipath channels","","315","","64","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Sensitivity, however, is a main weakness of CMOS imagers and enhancements and deviations from standard CMOS processes are necessary to keep up sensitivity with downscaled process generations. In the introductory section several definitions for the sensitivity of image sensors are reviewed with regard to their potential to allow meaningful comparison of different detector structures. In the main section, the standard CMOS sensor architecture is compared to detector structures designed to improve the sensitivity, namely the photogate (PG), the pinned photodiode (PPD) and the thin film on ASIC (TFA) approach. The latter uses a vertical integration of the photodiode on top of the pixel transistors. A careful analysis of the relevant electrical, optical and technological parameters and many previously published experimental data for different imagers reveals that only the PPD and the TFA enhancements provide satisfactory sensitivity and withstand scaling down to 0.18 /spl mu/ processes. Due to the higher fill factor and the higher quantum efficiency TFA provides significantly better values than PPD. The radiometric sensitivity of a 5 /spl mu/m/spl times/5 /spl mu/m TFA pixel is found to amount to 11.9 V/(/spl mu//cm/sup 2/) for a 0.25 /spl mu/m process and 27.5 V/(/spl mu/J/cm/sup 2/) for a 0.18 /spl mu/m process.","1557-9646","","10.1109/16.877173","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=877173","","Application specific integrated circuits","CMOS image sensors;application specific integrated circuits;photodiodes","CMOS based imagers;scaling perspectives;system-on-a-chip capability;image sensors;detector structures;photogate;pinned photodiode;ASIC;vertical integration;fill factor;quantum efficiency;radiometric sensitivity;5 micron;0.25 micron;0.18 micron","","65","","85","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Olson","Sleepycat Software, USA","Computer","","2000","33","9","27","34","Although embedded systems share many characteristics with their desktop and server counterparts, the unique advantages, limitations, and requirements of the applications they run demand a careful selection process and tailored implementation. The key strategy in choosing database tools for embedded systems is to focus on the application's requirements. Embedded database products vary widely from vendor to vendor. Some will do less than a particular application needs, some will do much more. By surveying the choices carefully, you can choose the tool that most closely matches your requirements. After choosing the operating system, hardware platform, and database software for a new embedded system, you must design a system that runs reliably with little or no human intervention. Unlike desktop and server systems, embedded systems cannot ask for operator help when the application encounters a problem. Finally, performance matters. Designing for performance up front, and evaluating it once you've built the application, is crucial. Fortunately, you can choose from a variety of techniques for evaluating and improving performance in database applications. To arrive at the best embedded-database-system solution, you must select the product that best matches your specific needs, then integrate that solution with your application.

Power should be available to the customer upon demand. The power companies strive to keep the reserve capacity to meet the sudden demand to a minimum. Load management techniques help the power company to reshape the electric utility load curve and to reduce the peak demand. The United States Government has filed lawsuits against 32 electrical utility plants charging the release of massive amounts of air pollutants throughout the Midwest and East coast. Electrical utilities are responsible for 65% of sulphuric dioxide emissions in the United States. If the customers demand more power, the power companies would supply power by building more generation facilities. This concept of supply-side management has been very popular in the seventies of the twentieth century. The demand-side management techniques influence the customers to help to reshape the load demand curves. This article analyzes the load management techniques in great detail. The power company must devise incentives to help customers to modify the load-curves. The customers must change their lifestyles to help to implement the load management techniques. Load management techniques make electricity do more by using it better. The important point is that less energy is wasted. Load management techniques could force the utilities to become globally competitive and control the demand and energy consumption.","","0-7803-6312-4","10.1109/SECON.2000.845449","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=845449","","Load management;Power generation;Power industry;Air pollution;Companies;Power engineering and energy;Power supplies;Force control;Energy consumption;Government","power system control;load management;electricity supply industry;energy storage;energy conservation","load management techniques;power companies;reserve capacity;United States Government;electric utility load curve;peak demand reduction;demand-side management;supply-side management;customer load curve modification","","19","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For each space, we use the single Gaussian model based on the Mahalanobis metric and a Gaussian mixture density model to segment faces from scene backgrounds. In the case of the mixture density model, the skin chrominance distribution is estimated by use of the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm. Feature extraction is performed on the segmented images by use of invariant Fourier-Mellin moments. A multilayer perceptron neural network (NN), with the invariant moments as the input vector, is then applied to distinguish faces from distractors. With the single Gaussian model, normalized color spaces are shown to produce the best segmentation results, and subsequently the highest rate of face detection. The results are comparable to those obtained with the more sophisticated mixture density model. However, the mixture density model improves the segmentation and face detection results significantly for most of the un-normalized color spaces. Ultimately, we show that, for each chrominance space, the detection efficiency depends on the capacity of each model to estimate the skin chrominance distribution and, most importantly, on the discriminability between skin and ""non-skin"" distributions.","","0-7695-0580-5","10.1109/AFGR.2000.840612","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=840612","","Skin;Face detection;Image segmentation;Image color analysis;Neural networks;Image analysis;Performance analysis;Humans;Layout;Feature extraction","skin;face recognition;feature extraction;Gaussian distribution;image colour analysis;image segmentation;optimisation;multilayer perceptrons","comparative performance;skin chrominance models;chrominance spaces;automatic detection;human faces;color images;color segmentation;two-dimensional static images;single Gaussian model;Mahalanobis metric;Gaussian mixture density model;expectation-maximisation algorithm;EM algorithm;feature extraction;invariant Fourier-Mellin moments;multilayer perceptron neural network;un-normalized color spaces;discriminability","","209","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They have rapidly become the de facto industry standard for replacement of legacy systems. Because there is evidence that the overwhelming majority of ERP implementations exceed their budget and their time allocations, researchers have begun to analyse ERP implementation in case studies in order to provide an implementation framework which maximises efficiencies. We argue that the concept of an ERP implementation is not a generic concept, and we present a taxonomy of ERP implementation categories. The evidence for the taxonomy is drawn from previous studies and from a series of structured interviews with practitioners who are expert in ERP implementation. We further argue that understanding the differences between these categories is crucial if researchers are to do case study research of ERP implementation; otherwise, comparisons are being made between ERP implementation projects which are essentially incommensurate. Conclusions based on incommensurate cases are inherently invalid. The taxonomy of implementation categories is also presented as a tool for implementation managers to delineate the scope of an ERP implementation project prior to in depth specification of the project processes.","","0-7695-0493-0","10.1109/HICSS.2000.926908","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=926908","","Taxonomy;Enterprise resource planning;Electrical capacitance tomography;Software packages;Packaging;Australia;Information systems;Process planning;Read only memory;Tellurium","business data processing;strategic planning;software packages","ERP implementation;enterprise resource planning;enterprise wide systems;company;business processes;industry standard;legacy systems;budget;case studies;software packages","","22","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the parameters [direction-of-arrival (DOA) and angular spread] of a spatially distributed source, using a uniform linear array (ULA). A two-step procedure enabling decoupling the estimation of DOA from that of the angular spread is proposed. This method combines a covariance matching algorithm with the use of the extended invariance principle (EXIP). More exactly, the first step makes use of an unstructured model for the part of the covariance matrix that depends on the angular spread. Then, the solution is refined by invoking EXIP. Instead of a 2-D search, the proposed scheme requires two successive 1-D searches. Additionally, the DOA estimate is robust to mismodeling the spatial distribution of the scatterers. A statistical analysis is carried out, and a formula for the asymptotic variance of the estimates is derived. Numerical examples illustrate the performance of the method.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.847774","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=847774","","Direction of arrival estimation;Scattering;Mobile communication;Base stations;Mobile antennas;Antenna arrays;Parameter estimation;Linear antenna arrays;Covariance matrix;Robustness","land mobile radio;direction-of-arrival estimation;linear antenna arrays;antenna theory;array signal processing;covariance matrices;search problems;statistical analysis","decoupled estimation;DOA;angular spread;spatially distributed source;mobile communications;local scattering;base station antenna array;direction-of-arrival;uniform linear array;two-step procedure;covariance matching algorithm;extended invariance principle;EXIP;unstructured model;covariance matrix;1-D searches;spatial distribution;statistical analysis;asymptotic variance","","154","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The power distribution systems have a radial network and unidirectional power flows. With the advent of dispersed generations, the power distribution systems have a locally looped network and bidirectional power flows. Therefore, DG into the power distribution system can cause operational problems and impact on existing operational schemes. There are several operational schemes in power distribution systems. One of these operational schemes is network reconfiguration, which is defined as altering the topological structures of distribution feeders by changing the open/closed states of the sectionalization and the switches. However, with the introduction of DG in power distribution systems, this increases the complexity of this problem. In this paper, an operational scheme is presented which uses network reconfiguration at the power distribution systems with DG as real-time operation tool for loss reduction.

This situation raises the question of how to perform power control for information sources other than voice. To explore this issue, we use the concepts and mathematics of microeconomics and game theory. In this context, the quality of service of a telephone call is referred to as the ""utility"" and the distributed power control problem for a CDMA telephone is a ""noncooperative game."" The power control algorithm corresponds to a strategy that has a locally optimum operating point referred to as a ""Nash equilibrium."" The telephone power control algorithm is also ""Pareto efficient,"" in the terminology of game theory. When we apply the same approach to power control in wireless data transmissions, we find that the corresponding strategy, while locally optimum, is not Pareto efficient. Relative to the telephone algorithm, there are other algorithms that produce higher utility for at least one terminal, without decreasing the utility for any other terminal. This article presents one such algorithm. The algorithm includes a price function proportional to transmitter power. When terminals adjust their power levels to maximize the net utility (utility-price), they arrive at lower power levels and higher utility than they achieve when they individually strive to maximize utility.","1558-0652","","10.1109/98.839331","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839331","","Power control;Telephony;Game theory;Cellular phones;Multimedia communication;Multimedia systems;Mobile communication;Mathematics;Microeconomics;Context-aware services","cellular radio;data communication;telecommunication control;power control;multimedia communication;game theory;quality of service;economics;voice communication;code division multiple access;distributed control;radio transmitters","Nash equilibrium;cellular phones;Pareto efficient algorithm;mobile multimedia communications;information sources;microeconomics;mathematics;game theory;quality of service;QoS;distributed power control;CDMA telephone;noncooperative game;wireless data transmissions;telephone power control algorithm;price function proportional;transmitter power;net utility maximization;utility-price","","425","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The loss of an eye can be solved cosmetically by an ocular implant. This artificial eye appears natural, but it is static. To let the artificial eye have the same natural movement as the real eye, an ocular system is developed. The artificial eye is mounted onto a tiny servomotor. The whole system shall be able to sense the real eye movement and control the motor to drive the artificial eye to the desired position. A tiny infrared sensor array is used for this study. This paper describes an approach of using the artificial neural network to do the sensor fusion to detect the eye movement. Two types of neural networks are used for the sensor fusion and sensor fault detection and recovery respectively. Usually the sensor fusion relies on the model of the system, however, sometimes it is not possible to get an accurate model of the system, or one or several of the parameters of the system may be unknown or partially known. In addition, there may be measurement inaccuracies associated with the sensors. In this case, the conventional method may not have a good performance. An artificial neural network can learn the characteristic of a non-linear, non-modeled system through training samples. Then during the real application, the sensor signal can be used to feed the network and obtain the desired output. Using the micro sensor array to detect the eye movement we carried out an experimental study. The sensor data is amplified and digitized then sent to the computer. Two-layer neural networks are trained by the data samples. First, the trained network is used for sensor fusion, and then two neural networks are used to detect the sensor failure and recover the faulty data respectively. Experimental studies with soft sensor failure and hard sensor failure are included. The main part of this paper deals with the network training method and further considerations.","0840-7789","0-7803-5957-7","10.1109/CCECE.2000.849763","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=849763","","Neural networks;Sensor fusion;Sensor arrays;Artificial neural networks;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Servomotors;Fault detection;Psychology;Implants;Control systems","Sensor fusion;Neural nets;Eye;Artificial organs;Image motion analysis;Servomotors;Optical sensors;Infrared imaging;Optical arrays;Learning (artificial intelligence);Medical computing;Microsensors;Biocontrol","micro sensor based eye movement detection;neural network based sensor fusion;fault detection;fault recovery;ocular implant;artificial eye;natural movement;ocular system;servomotor;motor control;infrared sensor array;artificial neural network;measurement inaccuracies;training samples;nonlinear system;sensor signal;two-layer neural networks;soft sensor failure;experiment;hard sensor failure;network training method","","3","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With that method, however, the time required to find the optimum path becomes remarkably long when the search scope is broad, so the Djikstra method is not suitable for real-time problems. In this paper, we propose a method for obtaining, in a short time, a path that is as close as possible to the path obtained by the Dijkstra method (the optimum path). The new method extends the conventional Dijkstra method so as to obtain a solution to a problem given within a specified time, such as path search in a car navigation system. The effectiveness of that extended method is described through use of simulations.","1062-922X","0-7803-6583-6","10.1109/ICSMC.2000.886462","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=886462","","Search problems;Navigation;Search methods;Costs;Road transportation;Communication networks;Explosives;Hardware;Genetic mutations","search problems;minimisation;computational complexity;real-time systems;navigation","shortest-path search problems;extended Dijkstra algorithm;optimum path;search scope;real-time problems;solution time;car navigation system;simulations","","31","","4","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Inst. of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","","2000","9","9","1484","1496","We present a novel formulation for B-spline snakes that can be used as a tool for fast and intuitive contour outlining. We start with a theoretical argument in favor of splines in the traditional formulation by showing that the optimal, curvature-constrained snake is a cubic spline, irrespective of the form of the external energy field. Unfortunately, such regularized snakes suffer from slow convergence speed because of a large number of control points, as well as from difficulties in determining the weight factors associated to the internal energies of the curve. We therefore propose an alternative formulation in which the intrinsic scale of the spline model is adjusted a priori; this leads to a reduction of the number of parameters to be optimized and eliminates the need for internal energies (i.e., the regularization term). In other words, we are now controlling the elasticity of the spline implicitly and rather intuitively by varying the spacing between the spline knots. The theory is embedded into a multiresolution formulation demonstrating improved stability in noisy image environments. Validation results are presented, comparing the traditional snake using internal energies and the proposed approach without internal energies, showing the similar performance of the latter. Several biomedical examples of applications are included to illustrate the versatility of the method.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.862624","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=862624","","Spline;Biomedical imaging;Convergence;Working environment noise;Application software;Physics computing;Associate members;Elasticity;Energy resolution;Image resolution","Feature extraction;Medical image processing;Splines (mathematics);Edge detection;Image resolution;Numerical stability;Noise;Prediction theory","B-spline snakes;parametric contour detection;contour outlining;optimal curvature-constrained snake;cubic spline;external energy field;regularized snakes;spline model model;spline elasticity control;spline knots spacing;multiresolution formulation;stability;noisy image environments;internal energies;biomedical applications;feature extraction","","201","","51","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Fleury","Center for PersonKommunikation, Aalborg Univ., Denmark","IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","","2000","46","6","2027","2044","We present analytical results relating to first- and second-moment characterization of direction dispersion and spatial selectivity in the radio channel as well as to the duality between these two effects. Dispersion in direction can be characterized either by the direction power spectrum or by a family of spatial Doppler power spectra at the reception site. Two measures called the direction spread and the maximum spatial Doppler spread are introduced which describe the extent of channel dispersion in direction and in spatial Doppler frequency, respectively. Both measures are analogous to the delay and Doppler spreads, which are commonly employed to describe the extent of dispersion in delay and Doppler frequency, respectively. The relationships between the two approaches for characterizing spatial dispersion and especially between the direction and maximum spatial Doppler spreads are analytically established. The coherence distance at a certain level summarizes certain features of space selectivity in the radio channel which impact on the performance of communication systems. Two uncertainty relations between the direction spread and the coherence distance as well as between the maximum spatial Doppler spread and the coherence distance express the duality between direction dispersion and space selectivity. These relations are analogous to those established previously between the delay spread and the coherence bandwidth and between the Doppler spread and the coherence time. Examples relevant to mobile communications in the case where the waves propagate only horizontally illustrate the theoretical results. An application of these results to the design of uniform linear antenna arrays is also discussed.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.868476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=868476","","Land mobile radio","land mobile radio;dispersive channels;Doppler effect;radiowave propagation;linear antenna arrays","second-order moment characterization;first-order moment characterization;direction dispersion;space selectivity;radio channel;direction power spectrum;spatial Doppler power spectra;reception site;direction spread;maximum spatial Doppler spread;channel dispersion;spatial Doppler frequency;delay spread;Doppler frequency;coherence distance;communication system performance;uncertainty relations;coherence bandwidth;coherence time;mobile communications;uniform linear antenna arrays;horizontal radio waves propagation","","156","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Univ. of Munich, Germany; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","2000","38","5","2270","2281","To monitor, map, and model sediment transport in big river estuaries, complete maps of bottom topography are needed. This information is obtained by extracting shorelines from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of the European remote sensing satellites (ERS-1R), tide gauge information, and heights from a dynamic tide model. The aim of this paper is to show how coastlines can be derived from SAR images by using wavelet and active contour methods. In a first step, an edge detection method suggested by Mallat et al. (1992) is applied to ERS SAR images to detect all edges above a certain threshold. A blocktracing algorithm (BA) then determines the boundary area between land and water. A refinement is achieved by local edge selection in this coastal area and by propagation along the wavelet scales. In a final step, the refined edge segments are joined by an active contour algorithm. A model solution for land water segmentation is constructed from a SAR image by visual inspection. The error is estimated by comparing the results from the algorithms to this model solution. The area under investigation is the Elbe estuary, which is located in the intertidal zone of the German Bight. Due to high rates of sediment transport in this area, local government agencies have to spend large amounts of money to keep shipping lanes open. The demonstrated method is shown to be suitable for operational use by applying it to a data set of 24 SAR images covering a time span of approximately five years.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.868884","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=868884","","Image edge detection;Remote monitoring;Sediments;Tides;Active contours;Image segmentation;Radar detection;Rivers;Surfaces;Data mining","geophysical techniques;oceanographic techniques;geophysical signal processing;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;radar imaging;edge dislocations;wavelet transforms;terrain mapping","geophysical measurement technique;land surface;ocean;coast;shoreline;terrain mapping;radar remote sensing;radar imaging;synthetic aperture radar;SAR;wavelet method;coastline;edge detection;blocktracing algorithm;block tracing algorithm;refined edge segment;image segmentation;image processing","","139","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown that epistasis, as expressed by the dominance of the flow and distance matrices of a QAP instance, the landscape ruggedness in terms of the correlation length of a landscape, and the correlation between fitness and distance of local optima in the landscape together are useful for predicting the performance of memetic algorithms-evolutionary algorithms incorporating local search (to a certain extent).

We investigate the use of space-time coding in OFDM-based broadband systems where both spatial and frequency diversity are available. We consider a strategy which basically consists of coding across OFDM tones and is therefore called space-frequency coding. For a spatial broadband channel model taking into account physical propagation parameters and antenna spacing, we derive the design criteria for space-frequency codes and we show that space-time codes designed to achieve full spatial diversity in the narrowband case will in general not achieve full space-frequency diversity. Specifically, we show that the Alamouti (see IEEE J. Sel. Areas Comm., vol.16, p.1451-58, 1998) scheme across tones fails to exploit frequency diversity. For a given set of propagation parameters and given antenna spacing, we establish the maximum achievable diversity order.

They have been applied in speech recognition and handwriting recognition because of their great adaptability and versatility in handling sequential signals. On the other hand, as these models have a complex structure and also because the involved data sets usually contain uncertainty, it is difficult to analyze the multiple observation training problem without certain assumptions. For many years researchers have used the training equations of Levinson (1983) in speech and handwriting applications, simply assuming that all observations are independent of each other. This paper presents a formal treatment of HMM multiple observation training without imposing the above assumption. In this treatment, the multiple observation probability is expressed as a combination of individual observation probabilities without losing generality. This combinatorial method gives one more freedom in making different dependence-independence assumptions. By generalizing Baum's auxiliary function into this framework and building up an associated objective function using the Lagrange multiplier method, it is proven that the derived training equations guarantee the maximization of the objective function. Furthermore, we show that Levinson's training equations can be easily derived as a special case in this treatment.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.845379","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=845379","","Hidden Markov models;Equations;Computer Society;Stochastic processes;Statistical learning;Speech recognition;Handwriting recognition;Lagrangian functions;Maximum likelihood estimation;Uncertainty","hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);combinatorial mathematics;speech recognition;handwriting recognition","hidden Markov model training;multiple observations;combinatorial method;HMM;statistical learning;statistical classification;speech recognition;handwriting recognition;handling sequential signals;Levinson training equations;multiple observation probability;dependence-independence assumptions;Lagrange multiplier method","","72","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus far, most work on space-time coding has assumed that perfect channel estimates are available at the receiver. In certain situations, however, it may be difficult or costly to estimate the channel accurately, in which case it is natural to consider the design of modulation techniques that do not require channel estimates at the transmitter or receiver. We propose a general approach to differential modulation for multiple transmit antennas based on group codes. This approach ran be applied to any number of transmit and receive antennas, and any signal constellation. We also derive low-complexity differential receivers, error bounds, and modulator design criteria, which we use to construct optimal differential modulation schemes for two transmit antennas. These schemes can be demodulated with or without channel estimates. This permits the receiver to exploit channel estimates when they are available.

Threats from vulnerability sources that are internal to the civil infrastructure may be reduced by decreasing the probability and severity of occurrence through the improved engineering of related systems. On the other hand, threats from vulnerability sources that are external to the infrastructure may be reduced by decreasing the severity of occurrence. To prevent or reduce catastrophic failures and cascading sequences of events caused by the various sources of vulnerability, the Advanced Power Technologies Consortium is researching ways to revolutionize defense strategies and technologies that will significantly reduce the vulnerability of the power infrastructure. Our vision is a wide-area, intelligent, adaptive protection and control system that empowers future grids by providing critical and extensive information in real time, assessing system vulnerability quickly, and performing timely self-healing and adaptive reconfiguration actions based on system-wide analysis. The proposed system is referred to as the strategic power infrastructure defense (SPID) system. The article discusses the conceptual design of the SPID system and the associated technical challenges. The fundamentally important concept is that the SPID system provides self-healing and adaptive reconfiguration capabilities for power grids based on wide-area system vulnerability assessment. Some experts believe that if 0.4% of the load had been shed for 30 minutes, the widespread power outage in the Western United States on 10 August 1996 could have been avoided. The SPID is intended to identify such load-shedding actions in real time based on proposed vulnerability assessment and protection/control systems.","1941-000X","","10.1109/37.856178","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=856178","","Power system protection;Power systems;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Control systems;Real time systems;Power engineering and energy;Systems engineering and theory;Power system faults;Information analysis","power distribution protection;power transmission protection;load shedding;probability;multi-agent systems;intelligent control;power system security","strategic power infrastructure defense system;SPID system;vulnerability;civil infrastructure;catastrophic failures;Advanced Power Technologies Consortium;defense strategies;wide-area intelligent adaptive protection and control system;self-healing;adaptive reconfiguration actions;system-wide analysis;technical challenges;load-shedding actions;vulnerability assessment","","108","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

They help overcome the need for ad hoc and often inappropriate choices of network topology in algorithms that search for suitable weights in a priori fixed network architectures. Several such algorithms are proposed in the literature and shown to converge to zero classification errors (under certain assumptions) on tasks that involve learning a binary to binary mapping (i.e., classification problems involving binary-valued input attributes and two output categories). We present two constructive learning algorithms, MPyramid-real and MTiling-real, that extend the pyramid and tiling algorithms, respectively, for learning real to M-ary mappings (i.e., classification problems involving real-valued input attributes and multiple output classes). We prove the convergence of these algorithms and empirically demonstrate their applicability to practical pattern classification problems. Additionally, we show how the incorporation of a local pruning step can eliminate several redundant neurons from MTiling-real networks.","1941-0093","","10.1109/72.839013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839013","","Classification algorithms;Pattern classification;Network topology;Neurons;Neural networks;Backpropagation algorithms;Training data;Space exploration;Convergence;Function approximation","pattern classification;learning (artificial intelligence);neural net architecture;minimisation;convergence","constructive neural-network learning algorithms;pattern classification;incremental construction;near-minimal neural-network architectures;zero classification errors;binary-valued input attributes;MPyramid-real;MTiling-real;pyramid algorithm;tiling algorithm;convergence;local pruning step;redundant neuron elimination","","134","","54","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The spread factor is independent of the dimensionality of the data and as such can be used as a controlling measure for generating maps with different dimensionality, which can then be compared and analyzed with better accuracy. The spread factor is also presented as a method of achieving hierarchical clustering of a data set with the GSOM. Such hierarchical clustering allows the data analyst to identify significant and interesting clusters at a higher level of the hierarchy, and continue with finer clustering of the interesting clusters only. Therefore, only a small map is created in the beginning with a low spread factor, which can be generated for even a very large data set. Further analysis is conducted on selected sections of the data and of smaller volume.

Many current approaches to this task generally involve a formidable nonlinear optimization problem in a large search space. Motion capture can be achieved more cost-efficiently when considering the motion constraints of a hand. Although some constraints can be represented as equalities or inequalities, there exist many constraints which cannot be explicitly represented. In this paper, we propose a learning approach to model the hand configuration space directly. The redundancy of the configuration space can be eliminated by finding a lower-dimensional subspace of the original space. Finger motion is modeled in this subspace based on the linear behavior observed in the real motion data collected by a CyberGlove. Employing the constrained motion model, we are able to efficiently capture finger motion from video inputs. Several experiments show that our proposed model is helpful for capturing articulated motion.","","0-7695-0939-8","10.1109/HUMO.2000.897381","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=897381","","Fingers;Motion analysis;Motion estimation;Human computer interaction;Image motion analysis;Animation;Image analysis;Data gloves;Biological system modeling;Costs","gesture recognition;optimisation;data gloves;constraint theory;redundancy;biomechanics;image motion analysis","human hand motion;motion constraint modelling;hand motion capture;gesture interfaces;nonlinear optimization;large search space;equalities;inequalities;learning approach;hand configuration space;redundancy elimination;lower-dimensional subspace;finger motion;linear behavior;CyberGlove;video inputs;articulated motion","","56","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We address the network vulnerabilities problem with test cases, which amount to attack scenarios, generated by a model checker.

Transmission of real-time video has bandwidth, delay, and loss requirements. However the current Internet does not offer any quality of service (QoS) guarantees to video transmission over the Internet. In addition, the heterogeneity of the networks and end systems makes it difficult to multicast Internet video in an efficient and flexible way. Thus, designing protocols and mechanisms for Internet video transmission poses many challenges. In this paper, we take a holistic approach to these challenges and present solutions from both transport and compression perspectives. With the holistic approach, we design a framework for transporting real-time Internet video, which includes two components, namely, congestion control and error control. Specifically congestion control consists of rate control, rate-adaptive encoding, and rate shaping; error control consists of forward error correction (FEC), retransmission error resilience, and error concealment. For the design of each component in the framework, we classify approaches and summarize representative research work. We point out there exists a design space which can be explored by video application designers and suggest that the synergy of both transport and compression could provide good solutions.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.899055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=899055","","Video compression;Error correction;Web and internet services;Quality of service;Shape control;Forward error correction;Bandwidth;Delay;Propagation losses;IP networks","Internet;multimedia communication;visual communication;real-time systems;telecommunication congestion control;error correction;quality of service","real-time video transport;Internet;multimedia communication;bandwidth;quality of service;congestion control;error control;loss;protocol;data compression;rate control;rate-adaptive encoding;rate shaping;forward error correction;retransmission error resilience;error concealment;delay;heterogeneity","","178","","67","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Published metal artifact reduction methods are based on the assumption that severe attenuation of X-rays by prostheses renders corresponding portions of projection data unavailable, hence the ""missing"" data are either avoided (in iterative reconstruction) or interpolated (in filtered back-projection with data completion; typically, with filling data ""gaps"" via linear functions). Here, the authors propose a wavelet-based multiresolution analysis method for metal artifact reduction, in which information is extracted from corrupted projection data. The wavelet method improves image quality by a successive interpolation in the wavelet domain. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the metal artifacts due to both photon starving and beam hardening can be effectively suppressed using the authors' method. As compared to the filtered back-projection after linear interpolation, the wavelet-based reconstruction is significantly more accurate for depiction of anatomical structures, especially in the immediate neighborhood of the prostheses. This superior imaging precision is highly advantageous in geometric modeling for fitting hip prostheses.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.897816","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=897816","","X-ray imaging;Computed tomography;Optical imaging;Hip;Prosthetics;Image reconstruction;Nonlinear filters;Wavelet domain;Interpolation;Attenuation","computerised tomography;medical image processing;wavelet transforms;orthopaedics;prosthetics;interpolation","X-ray CT metal artifact reduction;total hip prostheses imaging;severe X-ray attenuation;data completion;corrupted projection data;image quality;successive interpolation;wavelet-based multiresolution analysis method;photon starving;beam hardening;anatomical structures","Artifacts;Hip Prosthesis;Humans;Metals;Phantoms, Imaging;Radiographic Image Enhancement;Tomography, X-Ray Computed","160","","44","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A DC-to-DC boost converter is employed to step up the output DC voltage of the PV array. A DC-to-AC single-phase inverter is utilized to convert the higher DC voltage from the boost converter's output to the three-phase balanced voltages of utility's distribution system. The dynamic equations of the studied PV-utility's system are derived to examine the dynamic characteristics of the studied system under different operating conditions. The transient responses of the studied PV under different operating conditions are also examined. It can be concluded from the simulated results that the proposed methods are effective to explore the transient performance and dynamic characteristics of the studied combined PV-utility system under different disturbance conditions.","","0-7803-5935-6","10.1109/PESW.2000.850010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=850010","","Stability analysis;Photovoltaic systems;Solar power generation;Voltage;DC-DC power converters;Inverters;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Capacitors;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Equations","photovoltaic power systems;power system interconnection;power system dynamic stability;power system transient stability;control system analysis;solar cell arrays;transient response;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;DC-DC power convertors;DC-AC power convertors;invertors","photovoltaic array;large utility grid;dynamic stability analyses;eigenvalue method;DC-to-DC boost converter;PV array;interconnected PV power systems;DC-to-AC single-phase inverter;distribution system;dynamic equations;dynamic characteristics;operating conditions;transient responses;transient performance;disturbance conditions;control simulation","","19","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The inherent dynamical properties of the fast terminal sliding modes and the recursive mechanism for application in higher order systems are explored. A control design procedure is developed. It is shown that, by suitably choosing the parameters of the fast terminal sliding modes, the system state variables will reach the fast terminal sliding manifolds within a desired finite time, and stay in the sliding modes thereafter, resulting in the convergence to the equilibrium in a finite time which can also be prespecified. The control law designed, which is called ""the global terminal sliding mode control"", is nonlinear and continuous. It does not cause chattering in the reaching phase and sliding phase. The robustness analysis shows that the proposed global terminal sliding mode controller has superior robustness in system uncertainties and external disturbances. Simulation studies are presented to validate the proposed scheme.","0191-2216","0-7803-6638-7","10.1109/CDC.2000.914122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=914122","","Robust control;Sliding mode control;Uncertain systems;Control systems;Nonlinear control systems;Convergence;Uncertainty;Robustness;Force control;Informatics","variable structure systems;convergence;robust control;uncertain systems;nonlinear control systems;control system synthesis;control system analysis;nonlinear dynamical systems","robust global terminal sliding mode control;higher order SISO nonlinear dynamic systems;reaching phase;sliding phase;recursive mechanism;inherent dynamical properties;control design procedure;robustness analysis","","11","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The outcomes of the networks are then integrated using decision making schemes such as a simple voting scheme or the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence.

The flux waveforms are also shown to be essentially sinusoidal in different regions of the core. However, for the single-phase 4 limb core and the three-phase 5 limb core, the flux distribution is nonuniform and flux waves are very distorted. The calculated values of core losses were, generally, in excellent agreement with tested core losses of actual commercial transformers.

The original algorithm, however, has a serious drawback in that it is vulnerable to timing jitter (PRI jitter). We analyze the cause of this vulnerability and propose an improved algorithm using overlapped PRI bins which have shifting time origins.

This inverter can dynamically stabilize the output voltage, i.e., the output voltage of the inverter remains dynamically unchanged when subjected to large disturbances in the input voltage or output load. The stability analysis is presented. The closed-loop control system under P control, PI control, PD control, and PID control of the voltage loop for different types of loads are investigated.

The objective of this paper is to derive head tissue equivalent dielectric parameters that enable the utilization of one generic homogeneous head for testing compliance for the entire user group, i.e., granting no underestimation, but also not greatly overestimating the actual maximum user exposure. As a primary study, a simple analytical model of an infinite half-space layered tissue model exposed to a plane wave was utilized to investigate the impact of impedance matching standing waves, etc. On the spatial-peak specific absorption rate. The tissue layers were varied in composition and thickness, representing the anatomical variation of the exposed head region covering the user group including adults and children (<10% to >90% percentile). Based on the worst-case tissue layer compositions with respect to absorption at each frequency, head tissue equivalent dielectric parameters for homogeneous modeling were derived, which result in the same spatial-peak absorption. The validity of this approach for near-field exposures was demonstrated by replacing the plane wave by different near-field sources (dipoles and generic phones) and the layered structure with magnetic-resonance-image-based nonhomogeneous human head models.","1557-9670","","10.1109/22.884187","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=884187","","Electromagnetic wave absorption;Humans;Frequency;Magnetic heads;Testing;Dielectrics;Cellular phones;Safety;Ear;Analytical models","cellular radio;telephone sets;physiological models;electromagnetic wave absorption;biological effects of microwaves;safety","electromagnetic energy absorption;human head tissue composition;cellular phones compliance;normal operational conditions;ear region tissues;generic homogeneous head;maximum user exposure;spatial-peak specific absorption rate;anatomical variation;dielectric parameters;homogeneous modeling;spatial-peak absorption;magnetic-resonance-image-based nonhomogeneous human head models;layered structure;300 to 3000 MHz","","129","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To estimate the rotor position of the slotless PMSM, a flux estimation technique is used that takes advantage of the slotless machine's characteristically low inductance to limit flux estimation error. The rotor position is estimated using a reference model and the measured phase currents and voltages. At startup and very low speeds, discrete Hall sensors are used to limit the position estimation error to approximately /spl plusmn/30 electrical degrees and to prevent the flux estimators from drifting due to measurement noise and offset. The proposed sinusoidal control method reduces the torque pulsations present when Hall sensor position feedback alone is used and eliminates the need for high-resolution rotor angle sensors. The proposed control strategy is applied to a slotless PMSM drive system and implemented using a digital signal processor (DSP).

Research into the BDFRM has been largely ignored in comparison to the BDFIM, despite the fact that it has the potential for greater efficiency as compared to the BDFIM, and the rotor is simpler to manufacture. This paper compares the BDFRM and its singly fed cousin, the synchronous reluctance machine. This is a natural comparison since both machines use the same reluctance rotor. The first part of the paper establishes relationships between the inductances of the two machines. This is then used to facilitate a comparison using the constraints that both machines have the same amount of active material, i.e., the same amount of copper and iron, and that the copper losses for both machines are the same. This analysis also allows an approximate comparison with the conventional squirrel-cage induction machine.

Its purpose is to search for an optimal protection setting to minimize the system disturbance time as well as the time of interruption of the power supply.

Installed PV systems always have invisible elements other than those indicated by their electrical schematics. Stray inductance, capacitance and resistance are distributed throughout the system. Leakage currents associated with the PV modules, the interconnected array, wires, surge protection devices and conduit add up and can become large enough to look like a ground-fault. PV systems are frequently connected to other sources of power or energy storage such as batteries, standby generators, and the utility grid. This complex arrangement of distributed power and energy sources, distributed impedance and proximity to other sources of power requires sensing of ground faults and proper reaction by the ground-fault protection devices. The different DC grounding requirements (country to country) often add more confusion to the situation. This paper discusses the ground-fault issues associated with both the DC and AC side of PV systems and presents test results and operational impacts of backfeeding commercially available AC ground-fault protection devices under various modes of operation.

It is then important to minimize the total time needed for a gear shift, but when doing so driveline resonances may be excited. This in turn may lead to problems with disengaging the old gear and synchronizing speeds for engaging the new gear. Internal driveline torque control is a novel idea for handling resonances and increasing shift quality. By estimating the transmitted torque and controlling it to zero by engine control, the gear can systematically be disengaged with minimized driver disturbances and faster speed synchronization. Field trials show fast shifts to neutral gear, despite disturbances and driveline oscillations at the start of the gear shift. The control scheme is simple and robust against variations among different gears. Furthermore, damping of driveline resonances can be obtained with an observer in combination with a proportional integral derivative feedback structure, despite the higher order driveline system.","1558-0865","","10.1109/87.845880","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=845880","","Gears;Engines;Torque control;Automatic control;Resonance;Control systems;Damping;Vehicles;Robust control;Feedback","road vehicles;clutches;optimal control;minimisation;robust control;observers;three-term control;feedback","gear shifting;engine control;automated transmission;time minimization;driveline resonance excitation;internal driveline torque control;resonance handling;transmitted torque estimation;driveline resonance damping;PID feedback structure","","75","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such control systems typically arise in the computer control of continuous processes, for example, in manufacturing and chemical processes, in transportation systems, and in communication networks. A functional architecture of hybrid control systems consisting of a continuous plant, a discrete-event controller, and an interface is used to introduce and describe analysis and synthesis concepts and approaches. Our approach highlights the interaction between the continuous and discrete dynamics, which is the cornerstone of any hybrid system study. Discrete abstractions are used to approximate the continuous plant. Properties of the discrete abstractions to be appropriate representations of the continuous plant are presented, and important concepts such as determinism and controllability are discussed. Supervisory control design methodologies are presented to satisfy control specifications described by formal languages. Several examples are used throughout the paper to illustrate our approach.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.871307","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=871307","","Supervisory control;Communication system control;Control systems;Computer aided manufacturing;Control system synthesis;Computer networks;Process control;Manufacturing processes;Chemical processes;Transportation","discrete event systems;computerised control;control system synthesis;control system analysis;controllability","hybrid systems;computer control;continuous processes;manufacturing processes;chemical processes;transportation systems;communication networks;functional architecture;hybrid control systems;continuous plant;discrete-event controller;interface;determinism;controllability;control specifications;supervisory control design methodologies;formal languages","","183","","71","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These geomagnetically induced currents (GIC) cause problems to the systems. In power grids, transformers may be saturated due to GIC resulting in harmful effects and possibly even to a collapse of the whole system, as occurred in Quebec in March 1989. Transformers may also suffer from permanent damage. In buried pipelines, GIC can enhance corrosion and interfere with corrosion control surveys. Telecommunication systems as well as railway equipment may also malfunction due to GIC. The electric and magnetic fields observed at the Earth's surface primarily depend on magnetospheric-ionospheric currents and secondarily on currents induced in the Earth. The physical background and modeling of GIC are discussed in this paper. Special attention is paid to basic principles necessarily understood to get an insight into GIC phenomena. Recent developments in the use of the Complex Image Method (CIM) permit fast and accurate computations of the electric field suitable for time-critical applications like GIC forecasting.","1939-9375","","10.1109/27.902215","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=902215","","Storms;Magnetosphere;Saturation magnetization;Pipelines;Rail transportation;Transformers;Corrosion;Earth;Geomagnetism;Power systems","terrestrial electricity;ionosphere;magnetosphere;magnetic storms","terrestrial electricity;geoelectric;electric current;geomagnetically induced current;magnetotellurics;ionosphere;magnetic storm;substorm;ionospheric disturbance;electric field;electric power transmission grid;pipeline;telecommunication cable;railway equipment;magnetosphere;model;complex image method","","118","","44","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Impact of dynamic cross-saturation on accuracy of saturated synchronous machine models","E. Levi; V. A. Levi","Sch. of Eng., Liverpool Univ., UK; NA","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","","2000","15","2","224","230","Cross-saturation effect in synchronous machines has been a subject of considerable attention. Inclusion of the cross-saturation in the machine model has two consequences. The first one, called here ""steady-state cross-saturation"", consists of dependence of the steady-state d-q axis magnetizing inductances on the currents in both axes. The second one, termed here ""dynamic cross-saturation"", is the existence of nonzero elements in the system matrix, that describe cross coupling between d- and q-axis. Dynamic cross-saturation appears in all the saturated machine models, regardless of the selected set of state-space variables, with the exception of the winding flux linkage state-space model. The aim of this paper is to compare behavior of various models when dynamic cross-saturation is neglected. It is shown that the impact of dynamic cross-saturation on accuracy depends on the selected set of state-space variables. In the majority of cases omission of dynamic cross-saturation leads to very inaccurate results. However, it is found that for one particular class of models, omission of dynamic cross-saturation has practically no impact on accuracy. These models therefore fully describe the complete saturation effect by means of only continuous variation of the d-q axis magnetizing inductances.","1558-0059","","10.1109/60.867004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=867004","","Synchronous machines;Magnetic anisotropy;Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy;Magnetic flux;Saturation magnetization;Machine windings;Couplings;Steady-state;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Transient analysis","synchronous machines;machine theory;inductance;magnetization","dynamic cross-saturation;saturated synchronous machine models;steady-state cross-saturation;steady-state d-q axis magnetizing inductances;system matrix nonzero elements;cross coupling;state-space variables;winding flux linkage state-space model;d-q axis magnetizing inductances;main flux saturation","","78","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We demonstrate that even though DSR and AODV share a similar on-demand behavior the differences in the protocol mechanics can lead to significant performance differentials.

In this paper, therefore, a method is presented where the induced EMF and the d-axis reactance are determined in a no-load test and the q-axis reactance is determined in a load test. The load angle /spl delta/ is determined from the load test by means of a new analytical method. In this way, no separate measurement of the load angle is required. The method is especially suitable for line-start PMSMs which normally operate with negative d-axis current and, therefore, are not saturated in the d-axis flux paths.

These are similar to the Daubechies orthonormal filters, but designed with the additional constraint that the filter group delay should be approximately one quarter of the sample period. The filters in the two trees are just the time-reverse of each other, as are the analysis and reconstruction filters. This leads to a transform, which can use shorter filters, which is orthonormal beyond level 1, and in which the two trees are very closely matched and have a more symmetric sub-sampling structure, but which preserves the key DT CWT advantages of approximate shift-invariance and good directional selectivity in multiple dimensions.","1522-4880","0-7803-6297-7","10.1109/ICIP.2000.899397","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=899397","","Wavelet transforms;Delay;Discrete wavelet transforms;Continuous wavelet transforms;Sampling methods;Nonlinear filters;Signal processing;Image reconstruction;Matched filters;Image analysis","wavelet transforms;trees (mathematics);low-pass filters;FIR filters;filtering theory;delays;signal sampling;signal reconstruction;linear phase filters","dual-tree complex wavelet transform;orthogonality property;symmetry property;even-length bi-orthogonal filter;odd-length bi-orthogonal filter;even-length filter design;asymmetric coefficients;Daubechies orthonormal filters;filter group delay;sample period;reconstruction filter;analysis filter;symmetric sub-sampling structure;approximate shift-invariance;directional selectivity;multiple dimensions;linear phase lowpass FIR filter","","190","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The model inherently takes care of the frequency measurement along with the amplitude and phase of the signals. The theory has been applied to standard test signals representing the worst-case measurement and network conditions in a typical power system.

Each node is at most d hops from a clusterhead. Clusterheads form a virtual backbone and may be used to route packets for nodes in their cluster. Previous heuristics restricted themselves to 1-hop clusters. We show that the minimum d-hop dominating set problem is NP-complete. Then we present a heuristic to form d-clusters in a wireless ad hoc network. Nodes are assumed to have a non-deterministic mobility pattern. Clusters are formed by diffusing node identities along the wireless links. When the heuristic terminates, a node either becomes a clusterhead, or is at most d wireless hops away from its clusterhead. The value of d is a parameter of the heuristic. The heuristic can be run either at regular intervals, or whenever the network configuration changes. One of the features of the heuristic is that it tends to re-elect existing clusterheads even when the network configuration changes. This helps to reduce the communication overheads during transition from old clusterheads to new clusterheads. Also, there is a tendency to evenly distribute the mobile nodes among the clusterheads, and evently distribute the responsibility of acting as clusterheads among all nodes. Thus, the heuristic is fair and stable. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed heuristic is better than the two earlier heuristics, namely the LCA and degree-based solutions.","0743-166X","0-7803-5880-5","10.1109/INFCOM.2000.832171","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=832171","","Intelligent networks;Ad hoc networks;Routing;Ambient intelligence;Packet radio networks;Spine;Bones;Concurrent computing;Multiaccess communication;Spread spectrum communication","packet radio networks;telecommunication network routing;minimax techniques;mobile radio","max-min d-cluster formation;wireless ad hoc networks;virtual backbone;packet routing;minimum d-hop dominating set problem;NP-completeness;non-deterministic mobility pattern;wireless links;mobile nodes;heuristic;fairness","","428","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"A CAD system for the automatic detection of clustered microcalcifications in digitized mammogram films","Songyang Yu; Ling Guan","Sch. of Electr. & Inf. Eng., Sydney Univ., NSW, Australia; NA","IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","","2000","19","2","115","126","Clusters of microcalcifications in mammograms are an important early sign of breast cancer. This paper presents a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for the automatic detection of clustered microcalcifications in digitized mammograms. The proposed system consists of two main steps. First, potential microcalcification pixels in the mammograms are segmented out by using mixed features consisting of wavelet features and gray level statistical features, and labeled into potential individual microcalcification objects by their spatial connectivity. Second, individual microcalcifications are detected by using a set of 31 features extracted from the potential individual microcalcification objects. The discriminatory power of these features is analyzed using general regression neural networks via sequential forward and sequential backward selection methods. The classifiers used in these two steps are both multilayer feedforward neural networks. The method is applied to a database of 40 mammograms (Nijmegen database) containing 105 clusters of microcalcifications. A free-response operating characteristics (FROC) curve is used to evaluate the performance. Results show that the proposed system gives quite satisfactory detection performance. In particular, a 90% mean true positive detection rate is achieved at the cost of 0.5 false positive per image when mixed features are used in the first step and 15 features selected by the sequential backward selection method are used in the second step. However, one must be cautious when interpreting the results, since the 20 training samples are also used in the testing step.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.836371","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=836371","","Neural networks;Multi-layer neural network;Spatial databases;Breast cancer;Computer aided diagnosis;Object detection;Feature extraction;Feedforward neural networks;Image databases;Costs","mammography;medical image processing;cancer;image segmentation;wavelet transforms;feedforward neural nets;image classification","CAD system;automatic detection;clustered microcalcifications;digitized mammogram films;breast cancer;computer-aided diagnosis system;spatial connectivity;discriminatory power;general regression neural networks;sequential forward selection methods;sequential backward selection methods;multilayer feedforward neural networks;mammograms database;medical diagnostic imaging","Breast Neoplasms;Calcinosis;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Female;Humans;Mammography;Neural Networks (Computer);Radiographic Image Enhancement","189","","49","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The evaluation of control error in terms of the neural network learning error is performed. That is, the control error converges asymptotically to a neighborhood of zero, whose size is evaluated and depends on the approximation error of the neural network.

Their effects on insulation have been studied over a number of years using degree of polymerisation (DP) of the paper as a measure of ageing. Results are reported of a systemic study to measure the relative effectiveness of each component individually and in combination, on ageing in oil in a three-parameter two-level, partial factorial experiment. Ageing was measured in terms of change of degree of polymerisation of the paper and analysed according to recently developed models. In addition, the concentrations of furfural-based degradation products in the oil were measured. Water and temperature are most effective in accelerating ageing, with oxygen about one-third as efficient. There is a strong synergistic effect between temperature and water, a weaker synergism between temperature and oxygen, but, importantly, an apparent antagonistic effect between water and oxygen, at low water levels. If correct, the antagonism implies that the effectiveness of water, as an accelerator of ageing, decreases with increasing levels of oxygen in the oil at low water levels, which could explain why the insulation in scrapped transformers is sometimes found to be in very good condition.","1350-2344","","10.1049/ip-smt:20000021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=850594","","","power transformer insulation","degradation;cellulosic insulation;power transformers;oxygen;water;ageing;oil;cellulose insulation;electrical transformers;polymerisation;paper;three-parameter two-level partial factorial experiment;furfural-based degradation products;accelerating ageing;synergistic effect;antagonistic effect;O/sub 2/;H/sub 2/O","","92","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals"

It is shown that the information available in an ROLS algorithm after network training can be used to sequentially select centers to minimize the network output error. This provides efficient methods for network reduction to achieve smaller architectures with acceptable accuracy and without retraining. Two selection methods are developed, forward and backward. The methods are illustrated in applications of RBF networks to modeling a nonlinear time series and a real multiinput-multioutput chemical process.

The theory for analyzing the noise spectrum is developed further to account for the interaction between the motor and the drive. It is shown that manufacturing tolerances can result in significant differences in the noise level emitted from nominally identical motors, and that mechanical resonances can result in extremely high noise emissions. Such resonances can be induced by stator and rotor slot air-gap field harmonics due to the fundamental component of current, and by the interaction between the airgap field harmonics produced by the fundamental and the PWM harmonic currents. The significance of the effect of PWM strategy on the noise is closely related to the mechanical resonance with vibration mode order zero, while the PWM strategy will be critical only if the dominant cause of the emitted noise is the interaction of the fundamental air-gap field and PWM harmonics.","1557-9948","","10.1109/41.857968","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=857968","","Pulse width modulation;Acoustic noise;Induction machines;Pulse width modulation converters;Resonance;Space vector pulse width modulation;Noise level;Air gaps;Induction motors;Sampling methods","induction motor drives;acoustic noise;PWM power convertors;acoustic noise measurement;stators;rotors;harmonics;air gaps;machine control;PWM invertors","radiated acoustic noise;PWM-controllel induction machine drives;induction motors;sinusoidal converters;asymmetric regular sampling subharmonic converters;space-vector pulsewidth modulation converters;noise spectrum analysis;manufacturing tolerances;noise level;mechanical resonances;high noise emissions;rotor slot air-gap field harmonics;stator slot air-gap field harmonics;airgap field harmonics;fundamental PWM harmonic currents;PWM strategy;vibration mode order zero;acoustic noise measurement;PWM inverters","","107","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on his own experiences with ERP projects in the 1990s, the author found that for your project to succeed, you must prevent problems in the following high-priority areas: e-business strategy; project management approaches; complex technology and systems; and end-user resistance. A small investment in understanding, analyzing, tracking, and preventing these major problems should pay off well, given that most such problems are common, expected, avoidable, and detectable early. One viable approach to reducing the likelihood of failure is to identify the crucial risks at each point of the project life cycle, then build plans to address them before they become real problems. The author found this technique useful in evaluating ERP projects and fully expect it to be useful for evaluating e-business system projects as well.","1941-045X","","10.1109/6294.819935","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=819935","","Enterprise resource planning;Companies;Disaster management;Project management;Acceleration;Data warehouses;Inventory control;Materials requirements planning;Relational databases;Warehousing","business data processing;strategic planning;project management;personal computing","e-business success;ERP failures;enterprise resource planning;ERP projects;high-priority areas;project management approaches;complex technology;end-user resistance;crucial risks;project life cycle;real problems;e-business system projects","","5","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

First, by finding the singular values of the transmission matrix, fundamental limitations concerning the maximum gain and the diversity orders are given, indicating that the gain is upper bounded by (/spl radic/M+/spl radic/N)/sup 2/ and the diversity order is MN. Next an iterative technique for reciprocal channels which maximizes power at each stage transmitting back and forth is described.

High aspect-ratio polysilicon structures are created by refilling hundreds of micrometers deep trenches with polysilicon deposited over a sacrificial oxide layer. Thick single-crystal silicon structures are released from the substrate through the front side of the wafer by means of a combined directional and isotropic silicon dry etch and are protected on the sides by refilled trenches. This process is capable of producing electrically isolated polysilicon and silicon electrodes as tall as the main body structure with various size capacitive air gaps ranging from submicrometer to tens of micrometers. Using bent-beam strain sensors, residual stress in 80-/spl mu/m-thick 4-/spl mu/m-wide trench-refilled vertical polysilicon beams fabricated in this technology has been measured to be virtually zero. 300-/spl mu/m-long 80-/spl mu/m-thick polysilicon clamped-clamped beam micromechanical resonators have shown quality factors as high as 85 000 in vacuum.

In this paper, we present a frame work for such a network, which extends the traditional business-to-business e-commerce to e-commerce at the industry level. The proposed infrastructure differs from traditional portals in that it features the online integration of business transactions. It provides a virtual market for agents of the air cargo industry, enabling them to develop and engage in logistics integration.

This method uses reference patterns as items of evidence regarding the class membership of each input pattern under consideration. This evidence is represented by basic belief assignments (BBA) and pooled using the Dempster's rule of combination. This procedure can be implemented in a multilayer neural network with specific architecture consisting of one input layer, two hidden layers and one output layer. The weight vector, the receptive field and the class membership of each prototype are determined by minimizing the mean squared differences between the classifier outputs and target values. After training, the classifier computes for each input vector a BBA that provides a description of the uncertainty pertaining to the class of the current pattern, given the available evidence. This information may be used to implement various decision rules allowing for ambiguous pattern rejection and novelty detection. The outputs of several classifiers may also be combined in a sensor fusion context, yielding decision procedures which are very robust to sensor failures or changes in the system environment. Experiments with simulated and real data demonstrate the excellent performance of this classification scheme as compared to existing statistical and neural network techniques.","1558-2426","","10.1109/3468.833094","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=833094","","Neural networks;Multi-layer neural network;Prototypes;Computer architecture;Uncertainty;Sensor fusion;Artificial neural networks;Pattern classification;Pattern recognition;Robustness","pattern classification;inference mechanisms;uncertainty handling;multilayer perceptrons;least mean squares methods;sensor fusion","neural network classifier;Dempster-Shafer theory;adaptive pattern classifier;evidence theory;basic belief assignments;BBA;multilayer neural network;weight vector;receptive field;class membership;mean squared difference minimization;sensor fusion;statistical techniques","","216","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is known that the simultaneous estimation of speed and R/sub 2/ is impossible in the slip-frequency-type vector control, because the rotor flux is constant. In addition, the output voltage error due to the deadtime and the voltage drop of the inverter influences the rotor flux estimation, but the simultaneous compensation of the output voltage and stator resistance R/sub 1/ is very difficult. In this paper, the R/sub 2/ estimation without adding any additional signal to the stator current is proposed. In the high-frequency range, R/sub 2/ is estimated in the transient state and, in the very low-frequency range, R/sub 2/ is estimated in proportion to the estimated R/sub 1/ when the ideal voltage source by the power op-amp is used instead of the voltage-source inverter to avoid the output voltage error. Using these algorithms, the low-speed estimation was possible and the zero-speed control was achieved under the 10%-40% load condition. This paper clarifies that the zero-speed estimation is possible with the stator and rotor resistance estimations when the output voltage is ideal.","1939-9367","","10.1109/28.845051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=845051","","Voltage;Sensorless control;State estimation;Rotors;Stators;Machine vector control;Induction motors;Inverters;Industry Applications Society;Operational amplifiers","induction motors;machine vector control;velocity control;parameter estimation;machine theory;rotors;slip (asynchronous machines);control system synthesis;stators","speed-sensorless control;induction motor;machine parameters;rotor resistance;slip-frequency-type vector control;output voltage;stator resistance;stator current;high-frequency range;low-frequency range;zero-speed control;low-speed estimation;load condition;control design","","62","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To achieve this goal, each of the EPAD actuators was installed in place of the standard hydraulic actuator on the left aileron of the NASA F/A-18B Systems Research Aircraft (SRA) and flown throughout the SRA flight envelope. Numerous parameters were recorded, and overall actuator performance was compared with the performance of the standard hydraulic actuator on the opposite wing. This paper discusses the integration and testing of the EPAD electromechanical actuator (EMA) on the SRA. The architecture of the EMA system is discussed, as well as its integration with the F/A-18 flight control system.

Computational delay and loss of optimality arise in the optimisation procedures. The paper presents a practical MPC scheme for nonlinear systems with guaranteed asymptotic stability. It is shown that when an initial control profile is chosen to satisfy an inequality condition in each online optimisation procedure, the nonlinear system under the proposed nonlinear MPC is asymptotically stable. The stability condition presented in the paper enables the 'fictitious' terminal control to be nonlinear, rather than only linear, thus the stability region is greatly enlarged. Furthermore, it is pointed out that nominal stability is still guaranteed even though the global, or even the local, minimisation of the objective cost is not achieved within the prescribed computational time.","1350-2379","","10.1049/ip-cta:20000379","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=866921","","","predictive control","nonlinear control systems;model predictive control;optimisation;asymptotic stability;inequality condition","","33","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals"

The article presents a fuzzy rule based approach to spatio-temporal hand gesture recognition. This approach employs a powerful method based on hyperrectangutar composite neural networks (HRCNNs) for selecting templates. Templates for each hand shape are represented in the form of crisp IF-THEN rules that are extracted from the values of synaptic weights of the corresponding trained HRCNNs. Each crisp IF-THEN rule is then fuzzified by employing a special membership function in order to represent the degree to which a pattern is similar to the corresponding antecedent part. When an unknown gesture is to be classified, each sample of the unknown gesture is tested by each fuzzy rule. The accumulated similarity associated with all samples of the input is computed for each hand gesture in the vocabulary, and the unknown gesture is classified as the gesture yielding the highest accumulative similarity. Based on the method we can implement a small-sized dynamic hand gesture recognition system. Two databases which consisted of 90 spatio-temporal hand gestures are utilized for verifying its performance. An encouraging experimental result confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method.","1558-2442","","10.1109/5326.868448","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=868448","","Deafness;Auditory system;Fingers;Mice;Shape;Pattern recognition;Application software;Handicapped aids;Virtual reality;Neural networks","gesture recognition;fuzzy set theory;knowledge based systems;neural nets;spatial data structures;temporal logic","fuzzy rule based approach;spatio-temporal hand gesture recognition;gesture based applications;virtual reality;deaf;hyperrectangutar composite neural networks;HRCNNs;template selection;hand shape;crisp IF-THEN rules;synaptic weights;special membership function;unknown gesture;fuzzy rule;accumulated similarity;accumulative similarity;small-sized dynamic hand gesture recognition system","","37","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, we evaluate in detail one class of methods using a prototype implementation with instruction-level analysis of processing overhead. The comparison is based on a trace driven simulation of traces from a large ISP (Internet Service Provider) in Norway. The simulation model is used to analyze different load-balancing schemes based on redirection of request in the network and redirection in the mapping between a canonical name (CNAME) and IP address. The latter is vulnerable to spatial and temporal locality, although for the set of traces used, the impact of locality is limited. The best performance is obtained with redirection in the network.","1558-156X","","10.1109/65.855480","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=855480","","Load management;Web server;Network servers;Workstations;Prototypes;Protocols;Internet;Research and development;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","search engines;workstations;Internet;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;digital simulation","load balancing techniques;scalable Web servers;workstations network;server capacity;load-balancing;HTTP traffic;performance comparison;instruction-level analysis;processing overhead;trace driven simulation;Internet Service Provider;ISP;Norway;simulation model;canonical name;IP address;network request redirection;spatial locality;temporal locality;mapping redirection","","105","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The basis of the model is the relationship between the discharge voltage and SOC. This relationship is valid for a wide range of discharge rates and ambient temperatures as related to the telecommunications backup power supply application. Due to the robust nature of this relationship, only a single discharge characteristic under nominal operating conditions is required by the model. Case studies reveal that the model enables accuracy in estimation of SOC of better than 10% of actual SOC after discharging 10% of the rated capacity. As the discharge proceeds, the error reduces substantially. A feature of the model is that it is easily adaptable to changes in battery characteristics which occur as a result of extreme stress.","1557-9948","","10.1109/41.847897","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=847897","","State estimation;Power systems;Power system modeling;Voltage;Emergency power supplies;Power system analysis computing;Monitoring;Temperature;Battery charge measurement;Testing","telecommunication power supplies;lead acid batteries","Pb-acid valve regulated battery;VRLA battery;state-of-charge estimation;telecommunication power systems;valve-regulated lead-acid battery;battery discharge behavior;reserve time;discharge voltage;telecommunications backup power supply;nominal operating conditions;Pb","","60","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, all the three forms of the dynamic model of converter are obtained: the mathematical model, the model with equivalent circuit and the functional block diagram. Also, it computes the boundary between DCM and CCM, the decay interval, the efficiency, the static and dynamic properties of the converter. The external characteristics, the frequency responses and any function of the converter are computed and plotted too. This program performs the modeling and the analysis of four configurations: nonisolated Cuk, Sepic and Zeta PWM converters and the ripple-free input-current PWM boost converter.

To the contrary, measured data suggests realistic clutter environments appear heterogeneous and so the secondary data is no longer IID. Heterogeneity leads to mismatch between actual and estimated covariance matrices, thereby magnifying the loss between the adaptive implementation and optimum condition. Concerns regarding the impact of clutter heterogeneity on space-time adaptive processing (STAP) warrant further study. To this end, we propose space-time models of amplitude and spectral clutter heterogeneity, with operational airborne radar in mind, and then characterize expected STAP performance loss under such heterogeneous scenarios. Simulation results reveal loss in signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) ranging between a few tenths of a decibel to greater than 16 dB for specific cases.","1557-9603","","10.1109/7.845251","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=845251","","Radar clutter;Spaceborne radar;Covariance matrix;Performance loss;Performance analysis;Airborne radar;Radar detection;Interference;Signal to noise ratio;Space technology","space-time adaptive processing;radar signal processing;radar clutter;covariance matrices;airborne radar","space-time adaptive radar performance;heterogeneous clutter;covariance matrices;clutter heterogeneity;spectral clutter;operational airborne radar;performance loss;heterogeneous scenarios;signal-to-interference plus noise ratio","","247","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, their good transient and steady-state performances can not be achieved under wide load variations for a medical-use high voltage X ray generator ranging from 20 kV to 150 kV in the output voltage and from 0.5 mA to 1250 mA, respectively. A high-voltage DC power supply designed for X ray power generator applications is considered, which uses series resonant inverter-linked multistage DC voltage multiplier instead of conventional high voltage diode module rectifier connected to the secondary-side of a high-voltage transformer. A constant on-time/variable frequency control scheme of this converter operating at zero-current soft switching mode is described. Introducing the capacitor-diode cascaded multistage voltage multiplier, the secondary turn numbers, and secondary-side stray capacitance of the high-voltage high-frequency transformer as well as the rectifier diode voltage ratings can be greatly reduced. It is proven that the proposed converter control scheme of the 2 step changed frequency selection switching is more effective for improving output voltage responses. A series resonant high-frequency transformer-linked voltage-multiplying rectifier is evaluated for an X ray high voltage generator on the basis of simulation analysis and observed data in experiment.","","7-80003-464-X","10.1109/IPEMC.2000.884558","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=884558","","Resonance;DC-DC power converters;Voltage;Rectifiers;Power supplies;Diodes;Switching converters;Resonant inverters;Steady-state;Load management","X-ray production;power supplies to apparatus;resonant power convertors;pulse frequency modulation;voltage multipliers;invertors;DC-DC power convertors;switching circuits;frequency control;high-frequency transformers;capacitance;voltage control","series resonant high-voltage PFM DC-DC converter;voltage multiplier;two-step frequency switching control;medical-use X ray power generator;high-frequency inverters;constant value control schemes;steady-state performances;transient performances;high-voltage DC power supply;series resonant inverter-linked multistage DC voltage multiplier;constant on-time/variable frequency control;zero-current soft switching;capacitor-diode cascaded multistage voltage multiplier;secondary turn numbers;secondary-side stray capacitance;high-voltage high-frequency transformer;rectifier diode voltage ratings;output voltage responses;X ray high voltage generator;simulation analysis;20 to 150 kV;0.5 to 1250 mA","","20","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Once simulation of the protocol was nearly complete, the simulation was used as the basis for an implementation in the Linux operating system. In the course of converting the simulation into an implementation, certain modifications were needed in AODV and the Linux kernel due to both simplifications made in the simulation of AODV and to incompatibilities of the Linux kernel and the IP-layer to routing in a mobile environment.

In this paper, Bayesian hypothesis testing is combined with Kalman filtering to merge two different approaches to map-based mobile robot localization; namely Markov localization and pose tracking. A robot carries proprioceptive sensors that monitor its motion and allow it to estimate its trajectory as it moves away from a known location. A single Kalman filter is used for tracking the pose displacements of the robot between different areas. The robot is also equipped with exteroceptive sensors that seek for landmarks in the environment. Simple feature extraction algorithms process the incoming signals and suggest potential corresponding locations on the map. Bayesian hypothesis testing is applied in order to combine the continuous Kalman filter displacement estimates with the discrete landmark pose measurement events. Within this framework, also known as multiple hypothesis tracking, multimodal probability distribution functions can be represented and this inherent limitation of the Kalman filter is overcome.","1050-4729","0-7803-5886-4","10.1109/ROBOT.2000.846481","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=846481","","Bayesian methods;Kalman filters;Filtering;Robot sensing systems;Testing;Estimation theory;Mobile robots;Monitoring;Motion estimation;Feature extraction","mobile robots;position measurement;Bayes methods;Kalman filters;filtering theory;estimation theory;probability;Markov processes;tracking;feature extraction","Bayesian estimation;unified framework;mobile robot localization;decision theory;estimation theory;applied probability;Bayesian hypothesis testing;map-based mobile robot localization;Markov localization;pose tracking;proprioceptive sensors;trajectory estimation;pose displacement tracking;exteroceptive sensors;feature extraction algorithms;continuous Kalman filter displacement estimates;discrete landmark pose measurement events;multiple hypothesis tracking;multimodal probability distribution functions","","75","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In ad hoc networks, routes are mostly multihop and network hosts communicate via packet radios. Each host moves in an arbitrary manner and thus routes are subject to frequent disconnections. In typical mobile networks, nodes exhibit some degree of regularity in the mobility pattern. By exploiting a mobile user's non-random traveling pattern, we can predict the future state of network topology and thus provide a transparent network access during the period of topology changes.

The information gathered in the tutorial was required considering the increasing potential SMS offers for integration with existing messaging services and its ability to offer a successful replacement for the transmission control and Internet protocols as far as low-bandwidth-demanding applications are concerned. Initially, the tutorial gives an overview of the building blocks of GSM networks-the mobile station, base station, and network subsystem-and then emphasizes the SMS network and protocol architecture. The most widely used protocols for message submission are then introduced (text-based, SMS2000, ETSI 0705, TAP) and compared in terms of features provided and flexibility to handle extended alphabets or two-way messaging. Finally the tutorial outlines a summary of current and future issues for further development and research in the light of novel features for submission protocols and telematic services.","1558-0652","","10.1109/98.847919","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=847919","","GSM;Message service;Voice mail;Mobile communication;Weather forecasting;Land mobile radio cellular systems;Application software;Access protocols;Cellular networks;Delay","cellular radio;telecommunication services;transport protocols;radio networks","Global System for Mobile Communications;GSM Short Message Service;tutorial;telematic services;GSM networks;alphanumeric messages exchange;messaging services integration;transmission control protocol;Internet protocol;TCP/IP;low-bandwidth-demand applications;mobile station;base station;network subsystem;SMS network;protocol architecture;message submission;SMS2000;ETSI 0705;TAP;extended alphabets;two-way messaging;research;submission protocols;text-based protocol","","57","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Although the techniques selecting polynomial functions can generate various acceleration and deceleration characteristics, the major problem is the computational load. The digital convolution techniques are more efficient than the techniques selecting polynomial functions. However, neither velocity profiles of which the deceleration characteristics is independent from the acceleration characteristics nor those of which the acceleration interval is different from the deceleration interval can be generated by the digital convolution techniques. This paper proposes a generalized approach for generating velocity profiles that cannot be generated by the digital convolution techniques. According to the desired characteristics of acceleration and deceleration, each set of coefficients is calculated and is stored. Given a moving distance, and acceleration and deceleration intervals, a velocity profile having the desired characteristics of acceleration and deceleration can be efficiently generated by using these coefficients. Several velocity profiles generated by the proposed technique are applied to one single-axis control system.","1557-9948","","10.1109/41.824135","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=824135","","Acceleration;Computer numerical control;Character generation;Convolution;Computer industry;Industrial control;Service robots;Machine tools;Polynomials;Velocity control","industrial robots;computerised numerical control;machine tools;machining;acceleration control;braking;control system synthesis;process control","industrial robots;CNC machine tools;acceleration control;deceleration control;computer numerical control;polynomial functions;computational load;control design;digital convolution techniques;velocity profiles generation;single-axis control system","","83","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The input resistance of the RGC circuit becomes smaller by the amount of the voltage-gain of the local feedback stage than that of a conventional common-gate input stage. Hence the RGC circuit gives a virtual-ground input impedance and better isolates the input parasitics. With this very low input impedance characteristic, a RGC transimpedance amplifier is realized with a 0.6µm digital CMOS process. This amplifier is packaged in a MQFP package, mounted on a copper PC-board, and housed in an aluminum metal box. The measured results demonstrate 300MHz bandwidth, 57.7dB Ω transimpedance gain, 10 pA/√Hz average noise current spectral density with ±6V power supply.","","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1471302","","CMOS technology;Packaging;Low-noise amplifiers;Optical amplifiers;Circuits;Impedance;Isolation technology;Parasitic capacitance;Preamplifiers;Optical receivers","","","","5","","3","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Indeed, the field of evolutionary computation is one of the fastest growing areas of computer science and engineering for just this reason; it is addressing many problems that were previously beyond reach, such as rapid design of medicines, flexible solutions to supply-chain management problems, and rapid analysis of battlefield tactics for defense.

They estimate the number of Gaussian components from the number of inflection points of a smoothed copy of the laser waveform and obtain initial estimates of the Gaussian half-widths and positions from the positions of its consecutive inflection points. Initial amplitude estimates are obtained using a nonnegative least-squares method (LSM). To reduce the likelihood of fitting the background noise within the waveform and to minimize the number of Gaussians needed in the approximation, we rank the ""importance"" of each Gaussian in the decomposition using its initial half-width and amplitude estimates. The initial parameter estimates of all Gaussians ranked ""important"" are optimized using the Levenburg-Marquardt method. If the sum of the Gaussians does not approximate the return waveform to a prescribed accuracy, then additional Gaussians can be included in the optimization procedure or initial parameters can be recalculated.

A ferroelectric memory cell consists of at least one ferroelectric capacitor, where binary data are stored, and one or two transistors that either allow access to the capacitor or amplify its contents for a read operation. Once a cell is accessed for a read operation, its data are presented in the form of an analog signal to a sense amplifier, where it is compared against a reference voltage to determine its logic level. The circuit techniques used to generate the reference voltage must be robust to semiconductor processing variations across the chip and the device imperfections of ferroelectric capacitors. We review six methods of generating a reference voltage, two being presented for the first time in this paper. These methods are discussed and evaluated in terms of their accuracy, area overhead and sensing complexity. Ferroelectric memories share architectural features such as addressing schemes and input/output circuitry with other types of random-access memories such as dynamic random-access memories. However, they have distinct features with respect to accessing the stored data, sensing, and overall circuit topology.

The communication process is divided into seven distinct steps. When taken in order, these steps give the speaker the ability to communicate and influence a wide variety of people. Engineers and technical professionals in the IEEE environment can use the 7-Step Effective Communication Process to increase their communication effectiveness. By doing so they will stand out as more capable and more competent at influencing, leading, and conveying ideas and concepts to their colleagues and others. The 7-Step Effective Communication Process allows the speaker to understand the structure of the communication that would be most beneficial for the listener. Once this has been established, the speaker then builds rapport and begins the process of understanding the listener's paradigms. Once the listener's paradigms are understood the speaker can then send the desired message and then determine if the message was received as intended.

We show that the capacity of the channel in the wideband limit is the same as that of a wideband Gaussian channel with the same average received power. However, the input signals needed to achieve the capacity must be ""peaky"" in time or frequency. In particular, we show that if white-like signals are used instead (as is common in spread-spectrum systems), the mutual information is inversely proportional to the number of resolvable paths L/spl tilde/ with energy spread out, and in fact approaches 0 as the number of paths gets large. This is true even when the paths are assumed to be tracked perfectly at the receiver. A critical parameter L/spl tilde//sub crit/ is defined in terms of system parameters to delineate the threshold on L over which such overspreading phenomenon occurs.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.850678","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=850678","","Information rates","channel capacity;multipath channels;fading channels;spread spectrum communication;code division multiple access;multiuser channels;time-varying channels;Gaussian channels;broadband networks;land mobile radio;radio networks","mutual information;wideband multipath fading channels;channel capacity;broadband fading channel;time-varying paths;wideband Gaussian channel;average received power;input signals;white-like signals;spread-spectrum systems;receiver;system parameters;overspreading phenomenon;wireless communication;diversity reception;wideband CDMA;mobile radio","","217","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There are two narrow passbands separated by a distinct null. The CFSS creates electrically large elements from physically small ones to such an extent that a conventional /spl lambda//2 resonator in free space at the lower passband resonant frequency would be over three times longer than the dipole length employed in the CFSS. This passband is highly stable for normal and oblique TE and TM incidences, with less than 2% frequency shift. A full wave modal analysis is developed and two integral equations (IEs), an electric field IE and a magnetic field IE, are derived. These IEs are coupled and this renders them suitable for the solution of the CFSS problem. The interlayer dielectric region is critical to the location of the passbands as well as the in-band loss. Results are presented for dipole and ring CFSS and compared with measured data up to 40 GHz.","1350-2417","","10.1049/ip-map:20000799","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=909394","","","frequency selective surfaces;electromagnetic wave transmission;antenna theory;modal analysis;electric field integral equations;magnetic field integral equations;dipole antenna arrays;microwave antenna arrays;millimetre wave antenna arrays","complementary frequency selective surfaces;FSS technology;conducting elements layer;aperture elements layer;dielectric substrate;narrow passbands;distinct null;electrically large elements;passband resonant frequency;TM incidence;TE incidence;full wave modal analysis;electric field integral equation;magnetic field integral equation;EFIE;MFIE;interlayer dielectric region;in-band loss;ring arrays;dipole arrays;CFSS;Babinet's principle;12 to 40 GHz","","41","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals"

The task is feasible only when some constraints are placed on the shape of the trajectory of the moving point. We coin the family of such tasks as ""trajectory triangulation."" We investigate the solutions for points moving along a straight-line and along conic-section trajectories, We show that if the point is moving along a straight line, then the parameters of the line (and, hence, the 3D position of the point at each time instant) can be uniquely recovered, and by linear methods, from at least five views. For the case of conic-shaped trajectory, we show that generally nine views are sufficient for a unique reconstruction of the moving point and fewer views when the conic is of a known type (like a circle in 3D Euclidean space for which seven views are sufficient). The paradigm of trajectory triangulation, in general, pushes the envelope of processing dynamic scenes forward. Thus static scenes become a particular case of a more general task of reconstructing scenes rich with moving objects (where an object could be a single point).","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.845377","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=845377","","Image reconstruction;Image sequences;Cameras;Layout;Coordinate measuring machines;Shape;Geometry;Robustness;Airplanes;Numerical stability","image sequences;image reconstruction;stereo image processing","trajectory triangulation;moving point 3D reconstruction;monocular image sequence;monocular moving camera;line-of-sight measurements;straight-line trajectory;conic-section trajectories","","109","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The differential position technique commonly used in industry for velocity estimation suffers from a large quantization error and, therefore, limits the servo control loop bandwidth. This paper presents both the theoretical analysis and experimental verification of a scheme that uses a closed-loop observer for velocity estimation. The results have shown that the quantization error in the velocity feedback signal can be reduced dramatically when a closed-loop observer is used for velocity estimation.

The Bayesian probabilities are made possible to compute only with the availability of a large appropriately labeled database. Over 12000 images from the Compaq skin and non-skin databases are used to quantitatively assess the three approaches. Thresholds are determined empirically to detect 95% of all skin-associated pixels and assessment is then made in terms of the percentage of non-skin pixels incorrectly accepted.

To track an object in an image sequence, we use a criterion which combines two terms: the frame-to-frame deviations of the object shape and the fidelity of the modeled shape to the input image. The deformable template model utilizes the prior shape information which is extracted from the previous frames along with a systematic shape deformation scheme to model the object shape in a new frame. The following image information is used in the tracking process: 1) edge and gradient information: the object boundary consists of pixels with large image gradient, 2) region consistency: the same object region possesses consistent color and texture throughout the sequence, and 3) interframe motion: the boundary of a moving object is characterized by large interframe motion. The tracking proceeds by optimizing an objective function which combines both the shape deformation and the fidelity of the modeled shape to the current image (in terms of gradient, texture, and interframe motion). The inherent structure in the deformable template, together with region, motion, and image gradient cues, makes the proposed algorithm relatively insensitive to the adverse effects of weak image features and moderate amounts of occlusion.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.857008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=857008","","Deformable models;Image sequences;Prototypes;Tracking;Facial features;Biological system modeling;Face;Active shape model;Surface reconstruction;Data mining","image sequences;image motion analysis;computer vision;image texture","object tracking;deformable templates;frame-to-frame deviations;object shape;fidelity;object boundary;image gradient;region consistency;interframe motion;large interframe motion","","105","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"On the computation and reduction of the peak-to-average power ratio in multicarrier communications","V. Tarokh; H.

Subsequently, a method is proposed for computing the PAPR by minimum-distance decoding of C at many points of time. Moreover an upper bound on the error between this computed value and the true one is derived. Analogous results are established for codes defined over arbitrary signal constellations. As an application of this computational method, an approach for reducing the PAPR of C proposed by Jones and Wilkinson (1996) is revisited. This approach is based on introducing a specific phase shift to each coordinate of all the codewords where phase shifts are independent of the codewords and known both to the transmitter and the receiver. We optimize the phase shifts offline by applying our method for computing the PAPR for the coding scenario proposed by the ETSI BRAN Standardization Committee. Reductions of order 4.5 dB can be freely obtained using the computed phase shifts. Examples are provided showing that most of the gain is preserved when the computed optimal phase shifts are rounded to quantenary phase-shift keying (PSK), 8-PSK, and 16-PSK type phase shifts.","1558-0857","","10.1109/26.818871","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=818871","","Peak to average power ratio;Decoding;Phase shift keying;Upper bound;Constellation diagram;Computer applications;Transmitters;Optimization methods;Telecommunication standards;Standardization","decoding;codes;phase shift keying;OFDM modulation;quadrature amplitude modulation","peak-to-average power ratio;multicarrier communications;code;equal energy constellation;minimum-distance decoding;error;computational method;PAPR;phase shift;codewords;gain;quantenary phase-shift keying;8-PSK;16-PSK","","185","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We show that skin detection in video can be enhanced by exploiting the knowledge of the range of possible skin colours for the camera used. In normalized colour coordinates this range has a distinct shape we call the skin locus. We developed an adaptive histogram backprojection technique where the skin colour model is updated by pixels in the search region which fall in the skin locus.

By reconfiguring the network, voltage stability can be maximised for a particular set of loads in distribution systems. A new algorithm is formulated for enhancement of voltage stability by network reconfiguration. Initially, a certain number of switching combinations is generated using the combination of tie and its two neighbouring switches, and the best combination of switches for maximising the voltage stability in the network among them is determined. Then the search is extended by considering the branches next to the open-branches of the best configuration one by one to check whether there is any other switching combination available which gives further improvement in voltage stability. The enhancement of voltage stability can be achieved by the proposed method without any additional cost involved for installation of capacitors, tap-changing transformers and the related switching equipment in the distribution systems. The method has been tested on a 69-bus test system, and the results indicate that it is able to determine the appropriate switching options of the optimal (or near optimal) configuration for voltage stability enhancement with less computation.

To expand the controlled voltage range, buck boost or Cuk converter types should be utilized. This paper presents a circuit configuration with power factor correction by a third type of buck boost converter, termed a 'canonical switching cell'. Single-phase power factor correction using a buck boost converter can control the output voltage over a wide range, because it has the ability to step-up and step-down the output voltage. Firstly, this paper compares the mechanisms of the power transmission and the characteristics based on the switching ripple of various converters. Secondly, the canonical switching cell is applied to the single-phase power factor correction.

Traditional lane detection methods for vehicle navigation typically use spatial masks to isolate instantaneous lane information from on-vehicle camera images. When surveillance is concerned, complete lane and multiple lane information is essential for tracking vehicles and monitoring lane change frequency from overhead cameras, where traditional methods become inadequate. The algorithm presented in this paper extracts complete multiple lane information by utilizing prominent orientation and length features of lane markings and curb structures to discriminate against other minor features. Essentially, edges are first extracted from the background of a traffic sequence, then thinned and approximated by straight lines. From the resulting set of straight lines, orientation and length discriminations are carried out three-dimensionally with the aid of two-dimensional (2-D) to three-dimensional (3-D) coordinate transformation and K-means clustering. By doing so, edges with strong orientation and length affinity are retained and clustered, while short and isolated edges are eliminated. Overall, the merits of this algorithm are as follows. First, it works well under practical visual surveillance conditions. Second, using K-means for clustering offers a robust approach. Third, the algorithm is efficient as it only requires one image frame to determine the road center lines. Fourth, it computes multiple lane information simultaneously. Fifth, the center lines determined are accurate enough for the intended application.","1941-0492","","10.1109/3477.865171","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=865171","","Surveillance;Intelligent transportation systems;Vehicle detection;Cameras;Data mining;Clustering algorithms;Detection algorithms;Navigation;Vehicles;Monitoring","Parameter estimation;Edge detection;Surveillance;Traffic information systems;Traffic engineering computing","lane detection by orientation;length discrimination;visual traffic surveillance;intelligent transportation systems;curb structures;K-means clustering;multiple lane information","","65","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The new methods are also compared with random switching frequency modulation and with fixed switching frequency modulation.

Based on the test results, the impacts of the various firewall security levels on system performance with respect to transaction time and latency are measured and analyzed. It is interesting to note that the intuitive belief about security's relationship to performance, i.e. that more security would result in less performance, does not always hold in firewall testing. The results reveal that a significant impact of enhanced security on performance could only be observed under some particular scenarios, and thus their relationship is not necessarily inversely related.

Instead of using CPW series stub printed in the ground plane, as is the case in classical CPW-to-slotline transition, this paper shows the capability to use a CPW series stub printed in the center conductor of the CPW. Compared to classical CPW-to-slotline transitions, the proposed transitions have the following advantages: additional degrees of freedom, lower radiation loss, larger bandwidth, higher compactness, and a major reduction of the number of air bridges that are potentially expensive to build. One alternative configuration that appears to have some merit involves the use of the slotline ring resonator, which does not suffer from open-end or short-end effects and, therefore, gives more accurate resonance frequency, provides an accurate localized zero or infinite impedance point, and maintains low- or high-input impedance values over a wide frequency range, depending on the feed type. A principle of achieving such high-quality transitions is detailed and also confirmed by experimental and theoretical results, which are in good agreement up to 50 GHz. A maximum fractional bandwidth of 160% is achieved for a 10-dB return loss, and the corresponding insertion loss is less than or equal to 2 dB.","1557-9670","","10.1109/22.817482","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=817482","","Coplanar waveguides;Bandwidth;Impedance;Waveguide components;Waveguide transitions;Millimeter wave integrated circuits;Conductors;Bridge circuits;Slotline;Optical ring resonators","coplanar waveguides;slot lines;waveguide transitions;MIMIC;resonators;losses;integrated circuit design","broadband CPW-to-slotline transitions;monolithic millimeter-wave integrated circuits;center conductor;radiation loss;bandwidth;compactness;air bridges;slotline ring resonator;resonance frequency;infinite impedance point;high-input impedance values;feed type;high-quality transitions;maximum fractional bandwidth;return loss;insertion loss;50 GHz;10 dB;2 dB","","24","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Epitaxial layer structures were designed to yield well-matched channel doping profiles after processing, allowing comparison of strained and unstrained Si surface channel devices. In spite of the high substrate doping and high vertical fields, the MOSFET mobility of the strained-Si devices is enhanced by 75% compared to that of the unstrained-Si control devices and the state-of-the-art universal MOSFET mobility. Although the strained and unstrained-Si MOSFETs exhibit very similar short-channel effects, the intrinsic transconductance of the strained Si devices is enhanced by roughly 60% for the entire channel length range investigated (1 to 0.1 /spl mu/m) when self-heating is reduced by an ac measurement technique. Comparison of the measured transconductance to hydrodynamic device simulations indicates that in addition to the increased low-field mobility, improved high-field transport in strained Si is necessary to explain the observed performance improvement. Reduced carrier-phonon scattering for electrons with average energies less than a few hundred meV accounts for the enhanced high-field electron transport in strained Si. Since strained Si provides device performance enhancements through changes in material properties rather than changes in device geometry and doping, strained Si is a promising candidate for improving the performance of Si CMOS technology without compromising the control of short channel effects.","1557-9646","","10.1109/16.848284","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=848284","","MOSFETs","MOSFET;semiconductor epitaxial layers;doping profiles;silicon;elemental semiconductors;carrier mobility","fabrication;deep submicron strained Si n-MOSFET;strained Si/relaxed Si/sub 0.8/Ge/sub 0.2/ heterostructure;epitaxial layer;doping profile;surface channel device;short channel effect;transconductance;self-heating;AC measurement;hydrodynamic device simulation;high-field transport;low-field mobility;carrier-phonon scattering;CMOS technology;Si-Si/sub 0.8/Ge/sub 0.2/","","305","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An important feature of the optimizing interior point LP algorithm is that it can detect infeasibility of the SCED problem reliably. This feature is particularly important in SCED applications since line overloading following a contingency often results in an infeasible schedule.

Rapid progress in digital and RF technology is making possible highly compact and integrated terminal devices, and the introduction of sophisticated wireless data software is making wireless Internet access more user-friendly and providing more value. Transmission rates are currently only about 10 kb/s for large cell systems. Third-generation wireless access such as WCDMA and the evolution of second-generation systems such as TDMA IS-136+, EDGE, and CDMA IS-95 will provide nominal bit rates of 50-384 kb/s in macrocellular systems. This article discusses packet data transmission rates of 2-5 Mb/s in macrocellular environments and up to 10 Mb/s in microcellular and indoor environments as a complementary service to evolving second- and third-generation wireless systems. Dynamic packet assignment for high-efficiency resource management and packet admission; OFDM at the physical layer with interference suppression, space-time coding, and frequency diversity; as well as smart antennas to obtain good power and spectral efficiency are discussed in this proposal. Flexible allocation of both large and small resources also permits provisioning of services for different delay and throughput requirements.","1558-1896","","10.1109/35.852035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=852035","","Wideband;OFDM;Internet;Multiaccess communication;Resource management;Portable computers;Radio frequency;Time division multiple access;Bit rate;Data communication","OFDM modulation;packet radio networks;broadband networks;voice communication;time division multiple access;code division multiple access;microcellular radio;Internet;indoor radio;diversity reception;interference suppression;radiofrequency interference;encoding;adaptive antenna arrays","wideband wireless data access;OFDM;dynamic packet assignment;wireless voice subscribers;portable computing devices;wireless Internet access;RF technology;digital technology;integrated terminal devices;wireless data software;transmission rates;large cell systems;third-generation wireless access;WCDMA;second-generation systems;TDMA IS-136+;EDGE;CDMA IS-95;bit rates;macrocellular systems;packet data transmission rates;indoor environments;complementary service;high-efficiency resource management;packet admission;physical layer;interference suppression;space-time coding;frequency diversity;smart antennas;power efficiency;spectral efficiency;throughput requirements;delay requirements;2 to 5 Mbit/s;10 Mbit/s;50 to 384 kbit/s","","231","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

"Maximum-likelihood versus maximum a posteriori parameter estimation of physiological system models: the c-peptide impulse response case study","G. Sparacino; C. Tombolato; C. Cobelli","Dipt. di Elettronica e Inf., Padova Univ., Italy; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","","2000","47","6","801","811","Maximum-likelihood (ML), also given its connection to least squares (LS), is widely adopted in parameter estimation of physiological system models, i.e., assigning numerical values to the unknown model parameters from the experimental data. A more sophisticated but less used approach is maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Conceptually, while ML adopts a Fisherian approach, i.e., only experimental measurements are supplied to the estimator, MAP estimation is a Bayesian approach, i.e., a priori available statistical information on the unknown parameters is also exploited for their estimation. Here, after a brief review of the theory behind ML and MAP estimators, the authors compare their performance in the solution of a case study concerning the determination of the parameters of a sum of exponential model which describes the impulse response of C-peptide (CP), a key substance for reconstructing insulin secretion. The results show that MAP estimation always leads to parameter estimates with a precision (sometimes significantly) higher than that obtained through ML, at the cost of only a slightly worse fit. Thus, a 3 exponential model can be adopted to describe the CP impulse response model in place of the two exponential model usually identified in the literature by the ML/LS approach. Simulated case studies are also reported to evidence the importance of taking into account a priori information in a data poor situation, e.g., when a few or too noisy measurements are available. In conclusion, the authors' results show that, when a priori information on the unknown model parameters is available, Bayes estimation can be of relevant interest, since it can significantly improve the precision of parameter estimates with respect to Fisher estimation. This may also allow the adoption of more complex models than those determinable by a Fisherian approach.","1558-2531","","10.1109/10.844232","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=844232","","Maximum likelihood estimation;Parameter estimation;Insulin;Bayesian methods;Numerical models;Fluids and secretions;Costs;Least squares methods;Biomedical informatics;Covariance matrix","parameter estimation;organic compounds;biochemistry;physiological models;maximum likelihood estimation;Bayes methods","maximum a posteriori parameter estimation;maximum-likelihood parameter estimation;physiological system models;c-peptide impulse response;Fisherian approach;Bayesian approach;unknown parameters;sum of exponential model;insulin secretion reconstruction;Fisher estimation;Bayes estimation","Bayes Theorem;C-Peptide;C-Peptide;C-Peptide;Computer Simulation;Humans;Insulin;Likelihood Functions;Models, Biological;Normal Distribution;Reference Values;Time Factors","32","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is due to dissimilar load behaviors of holidays compared with those of ordinary weekdays during the year and to insufficiency of training patterns. The purpose of this paper is to propose a new short-term load forecasting method for special days in anomalous load conditions. These days include public holidays, consecutive holidays, and days preceding and following holidays. The proposed method uses a hybrid approach of ANN based technique and fuzzy inference method to forecast the hourly loads of special days. In this method, special days are classified into five different day-types. Five ANN models for each day-type are used to forecast the scaled load curves of special days, and two fuzzy inference models are used to forecast the maximum and the minimum loads of special days. Finally, the results of the ANN and the fuzzy inference models are combined to forecast the 24 hourly loads of special days. The proposed method was tested with actual load data of special days for the years of 1996-1997. The test results showed very accurate forecasting with the average percentage relative error of 1.78%.","1558-0679","","10.1109/59.867141","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=867141","","Load forecasting;Intelligent networks;Neural networks;Artificial neural networks;Predictive models;Power system reliability;Power system modeling;Weather forecasting;Fuzzy neural networks;Testing","load forecasting;power system analysis computing;neural nets;inference mechanisms;fuzzy set theory;load (electric)","short-term load forecasting;special days;anomalous load conditions;neural networks;fuzzy inference method;holidays;load behaviors;public holidays;consecutive holidays;days preceding holidays;days following holidays;hourly loads forecasting;scaled load curves;minimum loads forecasting;maximum loads forecasting","","119","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, any outdoor vision system is incomplete without mechanisms that guarantee satisfactory performance under poor weather conditions. It is known that the atmosphere can significantly alter light energy reaching an observer. Therefore, atmospheric scattering models must be used to make vision systems robust in bad weather. In this paper, we develop a geometric framework for analyzing the chromatic effects of atmospheric scattering. First, we study a simple color model for atmospheric scattering and verify it for fog and haze. Then, based on the physics of scattering, we derive several geometric constraints on scene color changes, caused by varying atmospheric conditions. Finally, using these constraints we develop algorithms for computing fog or haze color depth segmentation, extracting three dimensional structure, and recovering ""true"" scene colors, from two or more images taken under different but unknown weather conditions.","1063-6919","0-7695-0662-3","10.1109/CVPR.2000.855874","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=855874","","Layout;Light scattering;Optical scattering;Particle scattering;Atmospheric modeling;Machine vision;Atmosphere;Atmospheric waves;Physics;Computer vision","image segmentation;feature extraction;computer vision","outdoor vision system;poor weather conditions;atmospheric scattering models;bad weather;chromatic effects;atmospheric scattering;segmentation;feature extraction","","232","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The theory admits a more general representation of the magnetization vector than has been previously assumed, including both the radial and tangential components, and variation with radius. The work is applied in the design of PM motors where there is a requirement to minimize noise and torque ripple, and maximize efficiency, and a continuing need for improvements in the accuracy and rigor of design calculations. The air-gap flux-density distribution is at the heart of the design process, and it is desirable to study different magnetization patterns, including imperfections in the magnetization, for a wide range of magnet shapes. This paper shows the application of the analytical solutions in comparison with a new finite-element procedure, with test results on a prototype motor, and with simpler, older methods of calculation based on magnetic equivalent circuits.

Identification for a 1-DOF rigid-body, discrete-time linear model is presented. The extracted model is employed in the design of a feedback LQG compensator.

We investigate scaling challenges and outline device design requirements needed to support high performance-low power planar CMOS transistor structures with physical gate lengths (L/sub GATE/) below 50 nm. This work uses a combination of simulation results, experimental data and critical analysis of published data. A realistic assessment of gate oxide thickness scaling and maximum tolerable oxide leakage is provided. We conclude that the commonly accepted upper limit of 1 A/cm/sup 2/ for gate leakage is overly pessimistic and that leakage values of up to 100 A/cm/sup 2/ are deemed acceptable for future logic technology generations. Unique channel mobility and junction edge leakage degradation mechanisms, which become prominent at 50 nm L/sub GATE/ dimensions, are highlighted using quantitative analysis. Source-drain extension (SDE) profile design requirements to simultaneously minimize short channel effects (SCE) and achieve low parasitic resistance for sub-50 nm L/sub GATE/ transistors are described for the first time.","","0-7803-6305-1","10.1109/VLSIT.2000.852814","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=852814","","Doping;Gate leakage;Data mining;Scattering;Degradation;Logic devices;Maintenance;Temperature measurement;High-K gate dielectrics;MOS devices","CMOS logic circuits;integrated circuit technology;leakage currents;carrier mobility;doping profiles;MOSFET","scaling issues;device design requirements;planar CMOS transistors;low power transistor structures;gate oxide thickness scaling;maximum tolerable oxide leakage;logic technology;channel mobility degradation mechanism;junction edge leakage degradation mechanism;source-drain extension profile design requirements;short channel effects;low parasitic resistance;SCE minimisation;gate dielectric;50 nm","","96","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The newly developed transformer models add a great deal to software flexibility and are amenable to more realistic electric energy studies. This is partly due to the transformer models being fitted with complex tap changers in each winding and a nonlinear representation of the magnetizing branch.

The software system consists of: a novel implementation of a threshold classifier, a merging system to form regions through connected components, a separation and sorting system that gathers various region features, and a top down merging heuristic to approximate perceptual grouping.

"Least-squares design of IIR filters with prescribed magnitude and phase responses and a pole radius constraint","M. C. Lang","Inst. fur Nachrichtentech. & Hochfrequenztech., Wien Univ., Austria","IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","","2000","48","11","3109","3121","This paper presents a method for the frequency domain design of infinite impulse response (IIR) digital filters. The proposed method designs filters approximating prescribed magnitude and phase responses. IIR filters of this kind can have approximately linear-phase responses in their passbands, or they can equalize magnitude and phase responses of given systems. In many cases, these filters can be implemented with less memory and with fewer computations per output sample than equivalent finite impulse response (FIR) digital filters. An important feature of the proposed method is the possibility to specify a maximum radius for the poles of the designed rational transfer function. Consequently, stability can be guaranteed, and undesired effects of implementations using fixed-point arithmetic can be alleviated by restricting the poles to keep a prescribed distance from the unit circle. This is achieved by applying Rouche's theorem in the proposed design algorithm. We motivate the use of IIR filters with an unequal number of poles and zeros outside the origin of the complex plane. In order to satisfy simultaneous specifications on magnitude and phase responses, it is advantageous to use IIR filters with only a few poles outside the origin of the z-plane and an arbitrary number of zeros. Filters of this type are a compromise between IIR filters with optimum magnitude responses and phase-approximating FIR filters. We use design examples to compare filters designed by the proposed method to those obtained by other methods. In addition, we compare the proposed general IIR filters with other popular more specialized structures such as FIR filters and cascaded systems consisting of frequency-selective IIR filters and phase-equalizing allpass filters.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.875468","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=875468","","IIR filters;Finite impulse response filter;Digital filters;Poles and zeros;Frequency domain analysis;Design methodology;Linear approximation;Passband;Transfer functions;Stability","IIR filters;numerical stability;poles and zeros;least squares approximations;frequency-domain synthesis;linear phase filters;low-pass filters","least-squares design;IIR filters;magnitude response;phase response;pole radius constraint;frequency domain design;infinite impulse response digital filters;approximately linear-phase responses;maximum radius;poles;rational transfer function;stability;fixed-point arithmetic;Rouche theorem;zeros;z-plane","","110","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These models describe flows based on the assumption that they are long enough to sustain many packet losses. However, most TCP transfers across today's Internet are short enough to see few, if any, losses and consequently their performance is dominated by startup effects such as connection establishment and slow start. This paper extends the steady-state model proposed in Padhye et al. (1998), in order to capture these startup effects. The extended model characterizes the expected value and distribution of TCP connection establishment and data transfer latency as a function of transfer size, round trip time, and packet loss rate. Using simulations, controlled measurements of TCP transfers, and live Web measurements we show that, unlike earlier steady-state models for TCP performance, our extended model describes connection establishment and data transfer latency under a range of packet loss conditions, including no loss.","0743-166X","0-7803-5880-5","10.1109/INFCOM.2000.832574","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=832574","","Transport protocols","transport protocols;delay estimation;telecommunication traffic;Internet;performance evaluation","TCP latency;modeling;steady-state throughput;startup effects;connection establishment;slow start;Internet;performance;data transfer latency;transfer size;packet loss rate;round trip time;Web measurements","","202","","44","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, we present the design of linearly chirped fiber gratings (reflection configurations) and linearly chirped intermodal couplers (transmission configurations) to work as real-time spectrum analyzers. The proposed systems are shown to work properly by means of simulation tools. Furthermore, we use joint time-frequency signal representations to get a better understanding of the physical processes that determine the behavior of these systems. In this way, we demonstrate that the propagation of a given signal through a chirped fiber grating (or a chirped intermodal coupler), under the temporal Fraunhofer conditions, translates into a temporal separation of the spectral components of the signal.

In contrast to the conventional two-loop control methods with full-state feedback, the proposed controller does not need current information of the motor for feedback purposes. However, under normal operation the steady-state d-axis current can still be controlled to zero to minimize power dissipation. In addition, implementing a simple overmodulation strategy allows the controller to automatically generate a flux-weakening control to expand the range of operating speed when voltage saturation occurs. In addition to not depending on system parameters used by the controller, the automatically generated demagnetizing current is also optimal in the sense of minimum power dissipation that differs from the maximum output torque design or the constant power design of the general flux-weakening control methods. Simulation and experimental results show that the controller can achieve an effective speed and position control with near-minimum power dissipation, even when voltage saturation occurs.","1941-0107","","10.1109/63.867677","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=867677","","Automatic control;Permanent magnets;Automatic generation control;Power dissipation;Permanent magnet motors;Automatic voltage control;Optimal control;Torque control;Control systems;Velocity control","Permanent magnet motors;Synchronous motors;Machine control;Magnetic variables control;Magnetic flux;Reduced order systems;Angular velocity measurement;Position measurement;Feedback;Electric current control","automatic flux-weakening control;permanent magnet synchronous motors;reduced-order controller;velocity controller;position controller;two-loop control methods;full-state feedback;steady-state d-axis current control;power dissipation minimisation;voltage saturation;demagnetizing current;maximum output torque design;constant power design;stability analysis","","31","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Univ., South Korea; NA","IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","","2000","47","1","91","99","In this paper, a vibration suppression strategy is proposed for improving the riding comfort of an elevator, using car acceleration feedback compensation. The vertical vibration of a lift car is mainly caused by the resonance of elastic ropes between the car and the sheave, and the resonant frequency of the system is dependent upon both passenger load and lift position. To suppress the vibration of a lift car, the car velocity or acceleration is needed, but only a sheave velocity is measurable in a practical situation. The proposed method applies an extended full-order observer for the simultaneous estimation of car acceleration and the identification of mechanical parameters. Acceleration feedback compensation is used for the vibration suppression control. Experimental evaluation has been performed with a 30 kVA insulated gate bipolar transistor inverter and a medium-speed elevator system in an elevator test tower. Computer simulated and experimental results prove the feasibility of the proposed vertical-vibration controller.","1557-9948","","10.1109/41.824130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=824130","","Elevators;Acceleration;Feedback;Pulleys;Vibration measurement;Resonance;Resonant frequency;Accelerometers;Velocity measurement;Vibration control","lifts;vibration control;acceleration control;feedback;compensation;invertors;insulated gate bipolar transistors;resonance;observers","vertical-vibration control;elevator;vibration suppression control;lift car vertical vibration;elastic ropes resonance;passenger load;lift position;sheave velocity;extended full-order observer;car acceleration estimation;mechanical parameters identification;acceleration feedback compensation;insulated gate bipolar transistor inverter;medium-speed elevator system;elevator test tower;riding comfort;30 kVA","","42","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To date, the application of these techniques to software has been hindered by several obstacles. Chief among these is the problem of constructing a finite-state model that approximates the executable behavior of the software system of interest. Current best-practice involves hand construction of models which is expensive (prohibitive for all but the smallest systems), prone to errors (which can result in misleading verification results), and difficult to optimize (which is necessary to combat the exponential complexity of verification algorithms). The authors describe an integrated collection of program analysis and transformation components, called Bandera, that enables the automatic extraction of safe, compact finite-state models from program source code. Bandera takes as input Java source code and generates a program model in the input language of one of several existing verification tools; Bandera also maps verifier outputs back to the original source code. We discuss the major components of Bandera and give an overview of how it can be used to model check correctness properties of Java programs.","0270-5257","1-58113-206-9","10.1145/337180.337625","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=870434","","Java;Hardware;Explosions;Data mining;Computer languages;Mathematical model;Computer science;Logic;Humans;Manufacturing","program verification;Java;finite state machines;system monitoring","Bandera;finite-state models;Java source code;finite-state verification techniques;model checking;hardware design defects;executable behavior;software system;best-practice;exponential complexity;verification algorithms;integrated collection;program analysis;program transformation components;automatic extraction;program source code;input language;verification tools;verifier outputs;correctness properties;Java programs;program verification;model extraction;abstract interpretation;program specialization","","75","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For able-bodied subjects, all four joint angles (elbow flexion-extension and shoulder-horizontal flexion-extension, elevation depression, and internal-external rotation) were predicted with average root-mean-square (rms) errors of less than 20/spl deg/ during movements of widely different complexities performed at different speeds and with different hand loads. The corresponding angular velocities and angular accelerations were predicted with even lower relative errors. For individuals with C5 tetraplegia, the absolute rms errors of the joint angles, velocities, and accelerations were actually smaller than for able-bodied subjects, but the relative errors were similar when the smaller movement ranges of the C5 subjects were taken into account. These results indicate that the EMG signals from shoulder and elbow muscles contain a significant amount of information about arm movement kinematics that could be exploited to develop advanced control systems for augmenting or restoring shoulder and elbow movements to individuals with tetraplegia using functional neuromuscular stimulation of paralyzed muscles.","1558-0024","","10.1109/86.895950","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=895950","","Elbow;Kinematics;Shoulder;Muscles;Electromyography;Acceleration;Artificial neural networks;Spinal cord injury;Angular velocity;Control systems","kinematics;electromyography;biomechanics;medical signal processing;neural nets;neurophysiology","EMG-based prediction;elbow kinematics;shoulder kinematics;able-bodied individuals;spinal cord injured individuals;time-delayed artificial neural network;tetraplegia;C5 spinal cord injury;elbow flexion-extension;shoulder-horizontal flexion-extension;elevation depression;internal-external rotation;hand load;absolute rms errors;joint angles;joint velocity;joint accelerations;functional neuromuscular stimulation;paralyzed muscles;myoelectric control","","128","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such a behavior, apparently due to a kind of second breakdown phenomenon, has been scarcely considered in literature, as well as in manufacturer data sheets, although extensive experimental tests show that it is a common feature of modern low voltage metal oxide semiconductor held effect transistor (MOSFET) devices. The paper starts by analyzing some failures, systematically observed on low voltage power MOSFET devices, inside the theoretical forward biased safe operating area. Such failures are then related to an unexpected thermal instability of the considered devices. Experimental tests have shown that in the considered devices the temperature coefficient is positive for a very wide drain current range, also including the maximum value. Such a feature causes hot spot phenomena in the devices, as confirmed by microscope inspection of the failed devices. Finally, it is theoretically demonstrated that the thermal instability is a side effect of the progressive die size and process scaling down. As a result, latest power MOSFETs, albeit more efficient and compact, are less robust than older devices at low drain currents, thus requiring specific circuit design techniques.","1941-0107","","10.1109/63.844518","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=844518","","Low voltage;Failure analysis;MOSFET circuits;Power MOSFET;Power generation;Breakdown voltage;Semiconductor device breakdown;Semiconductor device manufacture;Semiconductor device testing;Temperature distribution","power MOSFET;semiconductor device reliability;failure analysis;semiconductor device models;semiconductor device measurement;semiconductor device testing;semiconductor device breakdown","low voltage power-MOSFETs;anomalous failure mechanism;low drain current;thermal instability;second breakdown phenomenon;forward biased safe operating area;temperature coefficient;hot spot phenomena;microscope inspection;circuit design techniques","","43","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A typical situation entails a limited pool of resources which is applied to the management of several projects, with people moving back and forth among different assignments in different projects. Yet, few studies on project management have started to explore the issue of how to manage an organization with multiple inter- or intradepartmental projects. Using a case study method, our exploratory research investigates the specific problems associated with the management of multiple engineering projects in a manufacturing support environment, with the intent to identify common factors of success. Knowing the factors of success is but the first step toward improving multi-project management. Our findings provide insight into how the most important multiple-project success factors in this environment differ from factors of success in traditional single-project management, and are consistent with other emerging research in product development environments. The differences center on resource allocation and flexibility. Some factors, such as ownership, staff experience, and communication, take on additional dimensions when considered in a multiple-versus a single-project environment. Division and assignment of resources, prioritization, and customized management style, which have little relevance in relation to single projects, are shown to play a major role in the success of multiproject management.","1558-0040","","10.1109/17.846792","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=846792","","Project management","project management;manufacturing industries;product development","multiple engineering projects management;manufacturing support environment;front-line managers;multiproject concepts;single-project management;intradepartmental projects;interdepartmental projects;multiple engineering projects;multi-project management;multiple-project success factors;product development environments;resource allocation;flexibility;ownership;staff experience;communication;prioritization;customized management style","","86","","64","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The human hand is a very complex grasping tool that can handle objects of different sizes and shapes. Many research activities have been carried out to develop artificial robot hands with capabilities similar to the human hand. In this paper the mechanism and design of a new humanoid-type hand (called TUAT/Karlsruhe Humanoid Hand) with human-like manipulation abilities is discussed. The new hand is designed for the humanoid robot ARMAR which has to work autonomously or interactively in cooperation with humans and for an artificial lightweight arm for handicapped persons. The arm is developed as close as possible to the human arm and is driven by spherical ultrasonic motors. The ideal end-effector for such an artificial arm or a humanoid would be able to use the tools and objects that a person uses when working in the same environment. Therefore a new hand is designed for anatomical consistency with the human hand. This includes the number of fingers and the placement and motion of the thumb, the proportions of the link lengths and the shape of the palm. It can also perform most part of human grasping types.

These models combine carrier number fluctuations and correlated mobility fluctuations. The latter are induced by the Coulomb scattering of free carriers at trapped interface charge. The unified 1/f noise models assume implicitly that the mobility, limited by Coulomb scattering, does not depend on the inversion carrier density. However, this assumption is not correct in view of theoretical calculations and recent experimental results. In this paper, we show that the correlated mobility fluctuations are negligible, if the correct dependence on inversion carrier density is taken into account for the Coulomb scattering limited mobility. Consequently, the unified 1/f noise models cannot predict the 1/f noise observed experimentally in p-type MOSFETs, except if nonphysical fitting parameters are used. This paper serves as a critical discussion on the unified 1/f noise models for MOSFETs. Here it is not our intention to propose a new 1/f noise model.","1557-9646","","10.1109/16.877177","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=877177","","MOSFETs","MOSFET;1/f noise;semiconductor device noise;semiconductor device models;fluctuations;carrier density","unified 1/f noise models;MOSFETs;BSIM3;carrier number fluctuations;mobility fluctuations;Coulomb scattering limited mobility;inversion carrier density;p-channel FETs;nonphysical fitting parameters;n-channel FETs","","57","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, the fuzzy logic principle is applied to control the speed of a stepping motor drive with feedback. An advanced test bed is used in order to evaluate the tracking properties and the robustness capacities of the fuzzy logic controller when variations of the mechanical configuration occur. The experiment has been performed using a low-cost 16 bit microcontroller in order to verify the design performance.","1557-9948","","10.1109/41.847902","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=847902","","Fuzzy logic;Velocity control;Motor drives;Open loop systems;Microprocessors;Micromotors;Robots;Computer numerical control;Machine tools;Feedback","stepping motors;motor drives;machine control;fuzzy control;angular velocity control;numerical control;closed loop systems;robust control;microcontrollers","fuzzy logic;speed control;stepping motor drive;microprocessors;robotics;numerical control;machine tools;high-precision positioning operations;mechanical configuration;loss of synchronism;high stepping rates;feedback;closed-loop control;tracking properties;robustness;fuzzy logic controller;microcontroller;design performance","","87","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These assumptions are easily satisfied in a quantitative computed tomography (QCT) setting. The authors have compared their algorithm to three commonly used single-energy correction techniques. Experimental results show that their algorithm is much more robust and accurate. The authors have also shown that QCT measurements obtained using their algorithm are five times more accurate than that from current QCT systems (using calibration). The dual-energy mode does not require any prior knowledge of the object in the scan field, and can be used to estimate the attenuation coefficient function of unknown materials.

These benefits make APR appear to be an ideal candidate for the bandwidth limited and mobile ad-hoc networks. However, we find that APR's potential is not fully realized in ad-hoc networks because of route coupling resulting from the geographic proximity of candidate paths between common endpoints. In multiple channel networks, coupling occurs when paths share common intermediate nodes. The coupling problem is much more serious in single channel networks, where coupling also occurs where one path crosses the radio coverage area of another path, The network's inherent route coupling is further aggravated by the routing protocol, which may provide an incomplete view of current network connectivity. Through analysis and simulation, we demonstrate the impact of route coupling on APR's delay performance in ad-hoc networks. In multiple channel environments, APR is able to provide a 20% reduction in end-to-end delay for bursty data streams. Though these gains are appreciable, they are about half what we would expect from APR with independently operating routes. Route coupling is so severe in single channel networks that APR provides only negligible improvements in quality of service.","","0-7803-6534-8","10.1109/MOBHOC.2000.869207","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=869207","","Load management;Ad hoc networks;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Bandwidth;Routing protocols;Performance analysis;Analytical models;Delay;Quality of service","telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic;telecommunication network reliability;access protocols;land mobile radio;quality of service","alternate path routing;load balancing;mobile ad hoc networks;route failure protection;traffic;APR;bandwidth limited communication;route coupling;multiple channel networks;single channel networks;radio coverage area;routing protocol;network connectivity;delay performance;end-to-end delay;bursty data streams;quality of service","","234","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The clipping is performed on the OFDM signals sampled at the Nyquist rate, followed by the ideal low-pass filter, Since the low-pass filter considerably enlarges the PAPR, there is a severe limitation in PAPR reduction capability. Thus, in order to achieve further reduction of the PAPR, the application of the adaptive symbol selection scheme is also considered. It is shown that the significant PAPR reduction with moderate complexity can be achieved by the combination of the clipping and the adaptive symbol selection. The price to be paid for PAPR reduction by this scheme is its performance degradation. The paper theoretically analyzes the bit error rate performance of the OFDM system with the Nyquist-rate clipping combined with the adaptive symbol selection, and considers the use of the forward error correction for compensation of the degradation. It is shown that even though the clipping scheme causes severe loss in required signal-to-noise ratio, the use of a powerful channel coding scheme such as turbo codes significantly alleviates the bit error rate performance degradation.","1558-0008","","10.1109/49.895032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=895032","","Peak to average power ratio;OFDM;Degradation;Low pass filters;Bit error rate;Error analysis;Performance analysis;Forward error correction;Signal to noise ratio;Channel coding","OFDM modulation;forward error correction;channel coding;turbo codes;error statistics;signal sampling;low-pass filters;adaptive signal processing","performance;deliberate clipping;adaptive symbol selection;strictly band-limited OFDM systems;peak-to-average power ratio;bit error performance;Nyquist rate;ideal low-pass filter;adaptive symbol selection scheme;performance degradation;forward error correction;compensation;signal-to-noise ratio;channel coding scheme;turbo codes","","195","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The authors assume that the image is composed of pixels assigned to a small number of categories with a priori known statistics. Further they assume that the image is corrupted by noise and a low-frequency inhomogeneity field. The estimation of the parametric bias field is formulated as a nonlinear energy minimization problem using an evolution strategy (ES). The resulting bias field is independent of the image region configurations and thus overcomes limitations of methods based on homomorphic filtering. Furthermore, PABIC can correct bias distortions much larger than the image contrast. Input parameters are the intensity statistics of the classes and the degree of the polynomial function. The polynomial approach combines bias correction with histogram adjustment, making it well suited for normalizing the intensity histogram of datasets from serial studies. The authors present simulations and a quantitative validation with phantom and test images. A large number of MR image data acquired with breast, surface, and head coils, both in two dimensions and three dimensions, have been processed and demonstrate the versatility and robustness of this new bias correction scheme.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.845174","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=845174","","Magnetic resonance imaging;Parametric statistics;Polynomials;Image segmentation;Nonlinear distortion;Histograms;Brightness;Impedance;Inspection;Pixel","image segmentation;biomedical MRI;medical image processing;minimisation","intensity inhomogeneities;parametric estimate;MRI;magnetic resonance imaging;image brightness values distortion;visual inspection;low-frequency bias field;intensity-based tissue segmentation;tissue class statistics;polynomial model;parametric model;a priori known statistics;nonlinear energy minimization problem;evolution strategy;homomorphic filtering;histogram adjustment;breast;head coils","Brain;Breast;Female;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Models, Theoretical;Phantoms, Imaging;Reproducibility of Results","306","","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In applications, these algorithms are used to determine and track the parameters that optimize a system level cost function in real time. The design of multiparameter ESA is greatly facilitated by the availability of simple models that explain the algorithm operation. In this paper, a simple model for stability and performance calculations is given. The model approximates the behavior of the ESA with an accuracy that improves as the dither frequencies used by the ESA are increased. The model predicts ESA stability and performance even if the cost function measurements are corrupted by noise or additional process dynamics. The model is for the general case of multivariable online optimization. Our approach to the analysis supports the addition of dynamic compensation in the ESA. Guidelines for the selection of the dither and the dynamic compensator are derived from our model.","0743-1619","0-7803-5519-9","10.1109/ACC.2000.878937","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=878937","","Algorithm design and analysis;Cost function;Optimal control;Stability;Iterative algorithms;Real time systems;Predictive models;Vibration control;Noise measurement;Low pass filters","optimal control;multivariable control systems;control system synthesis;stability","multivariable extremum seeking algorithms;parameter determination;parameter tracking;real-time system level cost function optimization;stability;performance calculations;multiparameter ESA design;dither frequencies;noise;additional process dynamics;multivariable online optimization;dynamic compensation","","85","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a basis for algorithm development, backscattering properties of snow-free and snow-covered alpine surfaces were investigated using ERS SAR data and field measurements at test sites in the Austrian Alps. The incidence angle dependence of backscattering derived from SAR data is compared with simulations for snow-free surfaces and for surfaces covered by dry snow and wet snow. Significant seasonal changes of backscattering are observed, which are mainly caused by variations of the snow liquid water content and of the surface roughness. The importance of surface roughness for backscattering of wet snow is demonstrated by a surface roughness experiment. The algorithm for mapping wet snow applies change detection using ratios of wet snow versus snow-free or dry snow surfaces. The main steps include coregistration, speckle reduction, thresholding of ratio images, geocoding, and, optionally, combination of crossing passes to reduce the loss of information due to layover. A threshold of -3 dB was found to be appropriate for both Radarsat and ERS SAR to separate wet snow from other surfaces. Postprocessing steps, based on historic snow maps or topographic information, are used to correct for dry snow areas at high elevations. Effects of imaging geometry are investigated by comparing ERS SAR images with a look angle of 19/spl deg/ and Radarsat SAR Beam Mode S7 images with a look angle of 40/spl deg/. The comparison of snow maps from SAR and Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper images shows good agreement in areas of closed snow cover, whereas near the snow line/SAR tends to slightly underestimate the snow extent.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.842004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=842004","","Information retrieval;Snow;Surface topography;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Backscatter;Terrain mapping;Synthetic aperture radar;Testing;Change detection algorithms","hydrological techniques;terrain mapping;snow;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;radar imaging;geophysical signal processing;radar cross-sections;backscatter","hydrology;snowpack;snowcover;snow cover;measurement technique;radar remote sensing;image sequence;wet snow;multitemporal SAR;synthetic aperture radar;algorithm;mountainous terrain;terrain mapping;repeat pass;backscattering;alpine surface;Austria;Austrian Alps;incidence angle;seasonal change;liquid water content;surface roughness;coregistration;speckle reduction;thresholding","","172","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For cases when no steady-state equilibrium point exists, mostly resulting from severe contingencies, a parameterized control strategy is first utilized to restore the system solvability. Then, the continuation method is applied to compute the corresponding minimum corrective control actions.

Detailed field measurements and forest growth model simulations of forest stands were used to parameterize this vegetation lidar waveform model. In the model, the crown shape of trees determines the vertical distribution of plant material and the corresponding lidar waveforms. Preliminary comparisons of averaged waveforms from an airborne lidar and model simulations shows that the shape of the measured waveform was more similar to simulations using an ellipsoid or hemi-ellipsoid shape. The observed slower decay of the airborne lidar waveforms than the simulated waveforms may indicate the existence of the understories and may also suggest that higher order scattering from the upper canopy may contribute to the lidar signals.

From the point-of-view of design and manufacturing this coupler geometry is attractive since it does not require capacitive loading. This comes at the expense of bandwidth: measured results show that over a 6.5% bandwidth /spl plusmn/0.125-dB power equality, 30 dB isolation and 1.07 VSWR is achieved for a coupler of length 1.25 /spl lambda//sub g/.

A powerful frequency-domain approach is therefore developed in which the average error-rate integral is transformed into the frequency domain, using Parseval's theorem. Such a transformation eliminates the need for computing (or approximating) the EGC output PDF (which is unknown), but instead requires the knowledge of the corresponding characteristic function (which is readily available). The frequency-domain method also circumvents the need to perform multiple-fold convolution integral operations, usually encountered in the calculation of the PDF of the sum of the received signal amplitudes. We then derive integral expressions for the average symbol-error rate of an arbitrary two-dimensional signaling scheme, with EGC reception in Rayleigh, Rician, Nakagami-m (1960), and Nakagami-q fading channels. For practically important cases of second- and third-order diversity systems in Nakagami fading, both coherent and noncoherent detection methods for binary signaling are analyzed using the Appell hypergeometric function. A number of closed-form solutions are derived in which the results put forward by Zhang (see ibid., vol.45, p.270-73, 1997) are shown to be special cases.","1558-0857","","10.1109/26.871398","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=871398","","Diversity reception;Diversity methods;Rayleigh channels;Frequency domain analysis;Performance analysis;Probability density function;Convolution;Rician channels;Fading;Signal analysis","diversity reception;radio receivers;Rayleigh channels;Rician channels;integral equations;frequency-domain analysis;signal detection;error statistics;telecommunication signalling","performance analysis;wireless channels;equal-gain diversity receiver;closed-form probability density function;PDF;dual-diversity combining;Rayleigh fading;received signal amplitudes;average error-rate integral;Parseval's theorem;characteristic function;frequency-domain method;integral expressions;average symbol-error rate;two-dimensional signaling;EGC reception;Rayleigh channel;Rician channel;Nakagami-m fading channel;Nakagami-q fading channel;third-order diversity system;second-order diversity system;coherent detection;noncoherent detection;binary signaling;Appell hypergeometric function;closed-form solutions;bit error probability;CPSK;CFSK","","169","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Special emphasis was placed on the effects of various stages in manufacturing processes, including post mould cure, thermal cycling, IR reflow and temperature and humidity storage, on the changes in interface adhesion. The interface bond strength was measured using the lead pull test. The lead frame surface was characterized using various techniques, such as atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ellipsometry, Raman spectroscopy and contact angle measurements, to correlate the measured interface bond strength with the surface characteristics of various types. It was confirmed that dimples etched on the lead frame surface offered several mechanical anchoring mechanisms and much improved interface bond with moulding compound. The interface bond strength and the number of dimples exhibited roughly a linear relationship. The black oxide and Pd coated surfaces were shown to provide the strongest interface adhesion, with the highest wettability amongst various surface finishes studied.

The fluctuating high frequency signal at a synchronously rotating reference frame with the fundamental stator frequency generates an asymmetry of the spatial impedances in an induction machine. The difference of impedances between the flux axis and the quadrature axis at high frequency signal injection on the rotor flux angle is explained by the equivalent circuit equation of the induction machine. And the physical phenomenon due to the injected signal is analyzed and examined by finite element method under various operating conditions. The difference is also verified experimentally on the test motors. An algorithm to estimate the rotor flux angle and the rotor speed utilizing the physical phenomena without any speed transducer is proposed. It contains a scheme extracting the high frequency impedance components related to the rotor flux position. The experimental results clarify the satisfactory operation of the algorithm with heavy load torque at zero stator frequency or zero speed regardless of operation mode-generating or motoring.","0197-2618","0-7803-6401-5","10.1109/IAS.2000.882124","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=882124","","Frequency;Rotors;Induction machines;Stators;Impedance;Induction generators;Signal generators;Synchronous generators;Equivalent circuits;Difference equations","induction motor drives;machine vector control;control system synthesis;stators;rotors;finite element analysis;machine testing;equivalent circuits;parameter estimation;machine theory","high-frequency injection method;fluctuating high frequency signal;synchronously rotating reference frame;fundamental stator frequency;rotor flux angle estimation algorithm;equivalent circuit equation;finite element method;operating conditions;sensorless control scheme;zero stator frequency;induction motor drives;zero stator speed","","23","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Results of accelerated life testing are presented to evaluate equalization requirements and to compare passive and active equalization approaches for valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) batteries. In both heavy cycling duty and high-temperature duty, battery degradation appears very early during expected life in the absence of equalization. The degree of equalization is critical: results show that voltage differences should be held to less than 15 mV/cell to prevent SOC separation in repeated cycling. The tests confirm that conventional overcharge-based passive equalization is effective for VRLA batteries-if there is sufficient time to ensure SOC matching among cells. Most proposed active voltage equalization methods in effect transfer the problem of SOC matching to external voltage matching of sensors and magnetic elements. Matching at the 15 mV/cell level is costly. A switched-capacitor approach has been identified that avoids this limitation. Test results show that switched-capacitor equalization is useful, particularly when the series string is too long to support enough time for passive equalization.","","0-7803-6407-4","10.1109/INTLEC.2000.884287","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=884287","","Batteries;Life testing;Voltage;Life estimation;Uninterruptible power systems;Equalizers;Circuit testing;Temperature;Degradation;Magnetic sensors","lead acid batteries;life testing;switched capacitor networks;battery chargers","valve-regulated Pb-acid battery equalisation;accelerated life tests;state-of-charge balance;heavy cycling duty;high-temperature duty;battery degradation;active voltage equalization;passive voltage equalization;switched-capacitor approach;Pb","","64","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multi-frame techniques, such as microscanning, are an effective means of reducing aliasing and increasing resolution in images produced by staring imaging systems. These techniques involve interlacing a set of image frames that have been shifted with respect to each other during acquisition. The FLIR system is mounted on a moving platform, such as an aircraft, and the vibrations associated with the platform are used to generate the shifts. Since a fixed number of image frames is required, and the shifts are random, the acquired frames will not fall on a uniformly spaced grid. Furthermore, some of the acquired frames may have almost similar shifts thus making them unusable for high-resolution image reconstruction. In this paper, we utilize a gradient-based registration algorithm to estimate the shifts between the acquired frames and then use a weighted nearest-neighbor approach for placing the frames onto a uniform grid to form a final high-resolution image. Blurring by the detector and optics of the imaging system limits the increase in image resolution when microscanning is attempted at sub-pixel movements of less than half the detector width. We resolve this difficulty by the application of the Wiener filter, designed using the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the imaging system, to the high-resolution image. Simulation and experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique. The techniques proposed herein are significantly faster than alternate techniques, and are found to be especially suitable for real-time applications.","1557-9662","","10.1109/19.872908","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=872908","","Infrared imaging;Image registration;Image reconstruction;Image resolution;High-resolution imaging;Optical imaging;Infrared detectors;Sensor arrays;Image sampling;Frequency","image reconstruction;image resolution;optical transfer function;infrared detectors;image sensors;digital simulation;real-time systems;image registration;infrared imaging;filtering theory;Wiener filters","IR image registration;high-resolution reconstruction;multiple translationally shifted aliased video frames;forward looking IR detector arrays;spatially undersampled images;microscanning;interlacing;moving platform;aircraft;vibrations;random;high-resolution image reconstruction;gradient-based registration algorithm;weighted nearest-neighbor approach;uniform grid;blurring;Wiener filter;modulation transfer function;high-resolution image;real-time applications;FLIR;aliasing;sub-pixel;Nyquist sampling","","100","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The authors have developed a single-phase BLDC drive for retrofitting into a state-of-the-art vacuum cleaner. However, it was found that due to high operation speed (20,000 RPM) and high winding inductance, the current and EMF waveforms were out of phase if the conventional control technique was used. Consequently, a negative torque component is generated and the overall torque is significantly reduced. In order to maximise the motor power density and to minimise the motor peak phase current so as to reduce the power device ratings for high-speed applications, two alternative commutation strategies are studied-one using the phase commutation advancing technique and another using conducting pulse-width control.

"Accurate transient simulation of transmission lines with the skin effect","Kyung Suk Oh","Avanti Corp., Fremont, CA, USA","IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","","2000","19","3","389","396","An accurate method to simulate the transient response of multiconductor transmission lines with the skin effect is discussed. The presented method is based on the novel difference model approach reported by Kuznetsov and Schutt-Aine (1996). The difference model approach has been shown to be reliable, accurate, and highly efficient. However, the author recently observed that the original implementation of the difference model produces a significant error when the skin-effect attenuation is present. The error is mainly due to the failure of the rational function approximation that is used to generate the difference model for the propagation function. In this paper, the term related to the skin effect is analytically extracted from the propagation function along with the propagation delay, and then, the remaining portion of the propagation function is approximated as before. For the characterization of the skin-effect term, the normalized modal skin-effect attenuation function is preapproximated using highly accurate mini-max approximation. The resulting approximation coefficients can then be scaled and used for the transient simulation without any further approximation, providing accurate and robust characterization of the skin-effect attenuation.","1937-4151","","10.1109/43.833207","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=833207","","Power system transients;Transmission lines;Skin effect;Function approximation;Convolution;Attenuation;Circuit simulation;Distributed parameter circuits;Piecewise linear approximation;Multiconductor transmission lines","multiconductor transmission lines;transient response;transient analysis;skin effect;transmission line theory;minimax techniques;convolution","transient simulation;multiconductor transmission lines;skin effect attenuation;difference model approach;rational function approximation;propagation function;propagation delay;mini-max approximation;approximation coefficients;recursive convolution","","21","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Dynamic peer groups require not only initial key agreement (IKA) but also auxiliary key agreement (AKA) operations, such as member addition, member deletion, and group fusion.

In this article, endmember variability is incorporated into mixture analysis by representing each endmember by a set or bundle of spectra, each of which could reasonably be the reflectance of an instance of the endmember. Endmember bundles are constructed from the data itself by an extension to a previously described method of manually deriving endmembers from remotely sensed data. Applied to remotely sensed images, bundle unmixing produces maximum and minimum fraction images bounding the correct cover fractions and specifying error due to endmember variability. In this article, endmember bundles and bounding fraction images were created for an airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) subscene simulated with a canopy radiative transfer/geometric-optical model. Variation in endmember reflectance was achieved using ranges of parameter values including leaf area index (LAI) and tissue optical properties observed In a North Texas savanna. The subscene's spatial pattern was based on a 1992 Landsat Thematic Mapper image of the study region. Bounding fraction images bracketed the cover fractions of the simulated data for 98% of the pixels for soil, 97% for senescent grass and 93% for trees. Averages of bounding images estimated fractional coverage used in the simulation with an average error of /spl les/0.05, a significant improvement over previous methods with important implications for regional-scale research on vegetation extent and dynamics.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.841987","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=841987","","Reflectivity;Vegetation mapping;Solid modeling;Biochemical analysis;Spectral analysis;Biochemistry;Error correction;Infrared imaging;Infrared spectra;Spectroscopy","geophysical techniques;geophysical signal processing;vegetation mapping;forestry","geophysical measurement technique;remote sensing;vegetation mapping;endmember bundles;endmember variability;spectral mixture analysis;vegetation cover fraction;canopy structure;forest;forestry;grass;trees;top-of-canopy reflectance;bundle unmixing;visible;infrared imaging;AVIRIS;leaf area index;North Texas savanna","","251","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Now it is desired to obtain the PDF of the length of the resulting vector. Considering the common and reasonable assumption of uniform distributions for the angles of the vectors, many researchers have obtained the PDF of the length of the resulting vector only for special cases. However in this paper, the PDF is obtained for the most general case in which the lengths of vectors are arbitrary dependent random variables. This PDF is in the form of a definite integral, which may be inappropriate for analytic manipulations and numerical computations. So an appropriate infinite Laguerre expansion is also derived.

Div., IBM Corp., San Jose, CA, USA","IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","","2000","36","1","36","42","This paper explores the feasibility of implementing conventional magnetic recording technology at densities up to one Terabit per square inch. The key limiting physical factor is the superparamagnetic effect (thermal stability) in the recording medium. Ambient thermal energy can cause the magnetic signals to decay. The requirement for thermal stability over periods of years dictates a lower limit to the size of magnetic grains (switching units) in the recording medium. To achieve the highest areal densities, it will be necessary to use a magnetic recording configuration capable of writing and storing data on very small magnetic grains together with a signal processing system capable of recovering data reliably when each bit is recorded on very few such grains. In addition to these physical effects, there are a number of practical engineering factors that must be considered: tolerances on the head geometry, reliability of head-disk interface, track-following accuracy. In an example system, we use a perpendicular recording configuration since it appears to offer some advantage in terms of maximizing the number of stable magnetic grains per unit area. The readback signals are processed by equalization to a simple binary eye followed by soft detection of a low-rate simple parity check code. The example system approaches a density of 1 Terabit per square inch and allows 3 dB of margin against thermal decay, adjacent track interference, etc.","1941-0069","","10.1109/20.824422","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=824422","","Magnetic recording;Perpendicular magnetic recording;Thermal stability;Signal processing;Limiting;Thermal factors;Magnetic switching;Writing;Reliability engineering;Magnetic heads","thermal stability;superparamagnetism;magnetic recording noise;perpendicular magnetic recording","magnetic recording;superparamagnetic effect;thermal stability;areal density;perpendicular recording;media noise;random grains;Voronoi region","","410","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Electrical power is needed for flexible, fast, precise and highly efficient control of actuators for many functions. Remotely controlled power switches for almost any load have been introduced in many cars, implementing protection besides control. Variable speed fans with electronically commutated motors are among the first applications with ""high power"" (>600 W) motor control. In particular, the need for further reduction in fuel consumption leads to the development of variable speed pumps for fuel supply, lubrication and cooling. Variable motor valves, electrical turbochargers, electrical power steering and active suspension systems are further examples which rely on power electronics. Although there is a general trend to use electrical power in such applications, the cost of power electronics is the critical aspect which dominates the optimal system configuration. First, this leads to the general goal to make power electronics less and less costly to manufacture in large volumes. On the other hand it is necessary to cooperate closely with other disciplines to find the most cost efficient solution in the sense of an integrated mechatronical approach to serve the needs of the market.","0275-9306","0-7803-5692-6","10.1109/PESC.2000.878789","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=878789","","Power electronics;Automotive engineering;Electric variables control;Fuels;Electric vehicles;Actuators;Protection;Fans;Brushless DC motors;Motor drives","automotive electronics;power electronics;automobiles;electric actuators;valves;variable speed gear;power supplies to apparatus","automotive power electronics;electrical power;actuator control;variable speed fans;high-power motor control;variable speed pumps;variable motor valves;electrical turbochargers;power steering;active suspension systems;integrated mechatronical approach","","13","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This technique utilizes the powerful mathematical and statistical capabilities of Excel. The functional reliability block diagram (RBD) of the system under investigation is first transformed into a table in an Excel spreadsheet. Each cell within the table corresponds to a specific block in the RBD. Formulae for failure times entered into these cells are in accordance with the failure time distribution of the corresponding block and can follow exponential, normal, lognormal or Weibull distribution. The Excel pseudo random number generator is used to simulate failure times of individual units or modules in the system. Logical expressions are then used to determine system success or failure. Excel's macro feature enables repetition of the scenario thousands of times while automatically recording the failure data. Excel's graphical capabilities are later used for plotting the failure probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the overall system. The paper discusses the results obtainable from this method such as reliability estimate, mean and variance of failures and confidence intervals. Simulation time is dependent on the complexity of the system, computer speed, and the accuracy desired, and may range from a few minutes to a few hours.","0149-144X","0-7803-5848-1","10.1109/RAMS.2000.816305","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=816305","","Random number generation;Satellite communication;Power system reliability;Testing;Power system modeling;Weibull distribution;CD recording;Probability density function;Distribution functions;Computational modeling","reliability;failure analysis;engineering computing;spreadsheet programs;statistical analysis;Monte Carlo methods;large-scale systems;probability","complex system reliability prediction;Monte Carlo simulation;Excel spreadsheet;functional reliability block diagram;failure times formulae;failure time distribution;pseudo random number generator;failure times simulation;failure probability density function;cumulative distribution function;confidence intervals","","3","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Optimum geometry for torque ripple minimization of switched reluctance motors","F. Sahin; H. B. Ertan; K. Leblebicioglu","Dept. of Electr. & Electron. Eng., Middle East Tech. Univ., Ankara, Turkey; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","","2000","15","1","30","39","For switched reluctance motors, one of the major problems is torque ripple which causes increased undesirable acoustic noise and possibly speed ripple. This paper describes an approach to determine optimum magnetic circuit parameters to minimize low speed torque ripple for such motors. The prediction of torque ripple is based on a set of normalized permeance and force data obtained from numerical field solution for doubly-salient geometries. For that purpose a neural net is trained to extract the data needed to predict the torque produced by a given geometry and excitation at any position of teeth. Hence the static torque curve can be constructed and torque ripple can be found. The accuracy of the approach developed is illustrated by comparing measured and predicted torque for a switched reluctance motor. The optimum parameters for minimum torque ripple conditions are sought using the augmented Lagrangian method. The paper presents the optimization results, and then proceeds to determine the range of geometric parameters which keep the torque ripple within /spl plusmn/10 of the optimum value.","1558-0059","","10.1109/60.849113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=849113","","Geometry;Reluctance motors;Minimization;Acoustic noise;Magnetic circuits;Neural networks;Data mining;Teeth;Torque measurement;Lagrangian functions","reluctance motors;torque;neural nets;magnetic circuits;electric machine analysis computing;stators;force","torque ripple minimization;switched reluctance motors;optimum geometry;undesirable acoustic noise;speed ripple;optimum magnetic circuit parameters;low speed torque ripple minimisation;torque ripple prediction;normalized permeance;force data;numerical field solution;doubly-salient geometries;neural net training;data extraction;teeth position;static torque curve;torque ripple;predicted torque;measured torque;augmented Lagrangian method;geometric parameters","","56","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Conventional block-based classification algorithms decide the class of a block by examining only the feature vector of this block and ignoring context information. In order to improve classification by context, an algorithm is proposed that models images by two dimensional (2-D) hidden Markov models (HMMs). The HMM considers feature vectors statistically dependent through an underlying state process assumed to be a Markov mesh, which has transition probabilities conditioned on the states of neighboring blocks from both horizontal and vertical directions. Thus, the dependency in two dimensions is reflected simultaneously. The HMM parameters are estimated by the EM algorithm. To classify an image, the classes with maximum a posteriori probability are searched jointly for all the blocks. Applications of the HMM algorithm to document and aerial image segmentation show that the algorithm outperforms CART/sup TM/, LVQ, and Bayes VQ.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.823977","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=823977","","Image classification;Hidden Markov models;Statistics;Data mining;Classification algorithms;Context modeling;Two dimensional displays;Probability;Parameter estimation;Image segmentation","image classification;image segmentation;hidden Markov models;document image processing;remote sensing;geophysical signal processing","image classification;two-dimensional hidden Markov model;block-based classification;feature vector;context;HMM;state process;Markov mesh;transition probabilities;neighboring blocks;maximum a posteriori probability;document image segmentation;aerial image segmentation","","168","","52","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Randomized algorithms are introduced to efficiently estimate this measure of criticality and provide quantitative bounds on the level of approximation introduced. For short-term detection, approximate closed-form analytical expressions for the probability of conflict are obtained, using the short-term prediction model.

MFDWC are similar to subband-based (SUB) features and multi-resolution (MULT) features in that both attempt to achieve good time and frequency localization. However, MFDWC have better time/frequency localization than SUB features and MULT features. We evaluated the performance of new features for clean speech and noisy speech and compared the performance of MFDWC with mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), SUB features and MULT features. Experimental results on a phoneme recognition task showed that a MFDWC-based recognizer gave better results than recognizers based on MFCC, SUB features, and MULT features for white Gaussian noise, band-limited white Gaussian noise and clean speech cases.","","0-7803-6312-4","10.1109/SECON.2000.845444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=845444","","Discrete wavelet transforms;Feature extraction;Speech recognition;Speech analysis;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Gaussian noise;Wavelet coefficients;Filter bank;Frequency domain analysis;Cepstral analysis","speech recognition;feature extraction;discrete wavelet transforms;channel bank filters;filtering theory;signal resolution;time-domain analysis;frequency-domain analysis;cepstral analysis;AWGN;bandlimited signals","feature extraction;discrete wavelet transform;speech recognition;mel-frequency discrete wavelet coefficients;MFDWC;DWT;mel-scaled log filterbank energies;speech frame;localization property;frequency domain;time domain;subband-based features;multi-resolution features;frequency localization;time localization;performance evaluation;clean speech;noisy speech;mel-frequency cepstral coefficients;experimental results;phoneme recognition task;bandlimited white Gaussian noise","","31","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These algorithms use a simple randomized communication mechanism to ensure robustness. Suppose n players communicate in parallel rounds in each of which every player calls a randomly selected communication partner. In every round, players can generate rumors (updates) that are to be distributed among all players. Whenever communication is established between two players, each one must decide which of the rumors to transmit. The major problem is that players might not know which rumors their partners have already received. For example, a standard algorithm forwarding each rumor form the calling to the called players for /spl Theta/(ln n) rounds needs to transmit the rumor /spl Theta/(n ln n) times in order to ensure that every player finally receives the rumor with high probability. We investigate whether such a large communication overhead is inherent to epidemic algorithms. On the positive side, we show that the communication overhead can be reduced significantly. We give an algorithm using only O(n ln ln n) transmissions and O(ln n) rounds. In addition, we prove the robustness of this algorithm. On the negative side, we show that any address-oblivious algorithm needs to send /spl Omega/(n ln ln n) messages for each rumor, regardless of the number of rounds. Furthermore, we give a general lower bound showing that time and communication optimality cannot be achieved simultaneously using random phone calls, i.e. every algorithm that distributes a rumor in O(ln n) rounds needs /spl omega/(n) transmissions.","0272-5428","0-7695-0850-2","10.1109/SFCS.2000.892324","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=892324","","Robustness;Computer science;Distributed databases;Computer crashes","randomised algorithms;communication complexity;replicated databases;information theory;database theory","randomized rumor spreading;epidemic algorithms;lazy update transmission;distributed database copies;randomized communication mechanism;robustness;parallel rounds;randomly selected communication partner;communication overhead;message transmissions;address-oblivious algorithm;lower bound;time optimality;communication optimality;random telephone calls;commmunication complexity","","229","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The objective of the research was to determine multipath and time varying channel behavior of short-hop millimeter-wave point-to-multipoint radio links during various weather events. 73963 power delay profiles (PDPs) were captured on three links, each comparable to proposed local multipoint distribution systems (LMDS) in a campus environment. Multipath was observed in unobstructed LOS links during rain but not during clear weather. Short-term variation of the received signal over 1-2 min observation periods is described by a Rician distribution with a K factor which varies as a function of rain rate. Measured rain attenuation exceeds Crane's (1996) model predictions by several decibels. A novel prediction technique is presented that applies canonical antenna patterns and site specific information to estimate worst case multipath channel characteristics including relative power, time of arrival (TOA), and angle of arrival (AOA) of each multipath component. New metrics, the excess delay zone and relative power zone, are defined and contour plots are developed to determine potential reflectors from an area site map.

The technique uses 700-nm-diameter fluorescent flow tracing particles, a pulsed Nd:YAG laser, an epi-fluorescent microscope, and a cooled interline transfer charge-coupled device camera to record images of flow tracing particles at two known instances in time. Instantaneous velocity vector fields are obtained with spatial resolutions of 5-10 /spl mu/m and temporal resolutions of 2-5 /spl mu/s. The relationship between instantaneous velocity fields is compared to instantaneous shapes of the meniscus. The flow in the nozzle is highly unsteady and characterized by a maximum velocity of 8 ms/sup -1/, Reynolds numbers of Re=500, and accelerations of up to 70 000 times gravity (i.e., 70 000 g). Since the flow field is periodic for each ejection cycle, the instantaneous measurements can be phased averaged to determine the evolution of the average flow field. The ejection cycle period is 500 /spl mu/s, and consists of four primary phases: infusion, inversion, ejection, and relaxation. During infusion, the actuator plate is deflected downward creating a low pressure that draws fluid into the inkjet cavity through the orifice and pulls the meniscus into the cavity through the nozzle. The meniscus grows, begins to decrease in size, and then deforms in shape, becoming inverted for approximately 6 /spl mu/s. The meniscus exits the cavity through the nozzle during droplet ejection. During relaxation, the flow undergoes viscously-damped oscillations, and reaches equilibrium before the next ejection cycle begins.","1941-0158","","10.1109/84.825779","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=825779","","Spatial resolution;Shape;Image resolution;Velocity measurement;Particle measurements;Fluorescence;Optical pulses;Microscopy;Cameras;Acceleration","ink jet printers;laser velocimetry;flow visualisation;nozzles;microfluidics;drops;optical microscopy;fluorescence","microfabricated inkjet printhead;flow structure;particle image velocimetry system;micrometer resolution;instantaneous velocity fields;fluorescent flow tracing particles;pulsed Nd:YAG laser;epi-fluorescent microscope;cooled interline transfer CCD camera;unsteady nozzle flow;instantaneous measurements;phased averaged;average flow field evolution;infusion;inversion;ejection;relaxation;meniscus;droplet ejection;viscously-damped oscillations;microfluidics;SEAJet nozzle","","109","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Evidence for transformer failures related to insulation failure indicates that the primary cause is normally mechanical failure/loss of integrity due to loss of mechanical strength as a result of degradation. The paper investigates the primary causes of loss of strength of paper during ageing under accelerated conditions in insulating oil. The latest mathematical models are used to relate change of tensile strength to ageing time and to degree of polymerisation (DP). Comparison of measurements using wide-span and zero-span tensometers suggests that the primary loss of strength results from loss of fibre strength, but that failure ultimately occurs due to loss of inter-fibre strength. This remains constant until a DP of about 200, then rapidly falls to zero, at the same time as the furan levels in the oil increase. It is suggested that a better understanding of the statistical probability of loss of inter-fibre strength would provide a better end-of-life criterion for predicting insulation life than those currently used.","1350-2344","","10.1049/ip-smt:20000644","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=899976","","","power transformer insulation;power transformer testing;tensile strength;paper;ageing;life testing;probability","cellulosic insulation degradation;power transformers;tensile strength;paper;ageing;transformer failures;insulation failure;mechanical failure/loss;mechanical strength;accelerated conditions;insulating oil;mathematical models;zero-span tensometer;wide-span tensometer;fibre strength;inter-fibre strength;furan levels;statistical probability;end-of-life criterion","","62","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals"

The input structure of the new solution consists of transmission gates and capacitors only and there is no need for any active element. A switching circuit is implemented to allow a wider input voltage range of the ADC. Together with a self timed comparator the power consumption is noticeably reduced while at the same time the sampling rate is doubled. Smaller input and reference capacitances reduce the requirements on the input and reference sources, respectively. Additionally, a clock duty cycle independent control logic improves the applicability of the converter cell especially for systems on chip.

Eng., POSTECH Univ., Pohang, South Korea; NA","IEE Proceedings - Generation, Transmission and Distribution","","2000","147","6","409","415","If a negative sequence is generated by voltage sag and/or unbalance, it appears as an oscillating error in a synchronous reference frame (SRF). In power conditioning equipment, the exact value of a positive sequence is needed to achieve the unity power factor and constant output voltage, whereas the exact value of a negative sequence is needed for unbalance compensation. To measure the positive sequence separately from the negative sequence, a low pass or notch filter having a narrow bandwidth is normally used. However, such a filter causes a lot of phase delay, thus the response time of the system tends to be lengthened. A method of estimating the positive- and the negative-sequence voltages separately is presented, without a significant delay, by utilising the weighted least-squares estimation (WLSE) method with the covariance resetting technique. A frequency update law is also proposed to accommodate the frequency varying environments. The authors demonstrate through simulation and experiment the superior performance of the proposed scheme in measuring the positive- and the negative-sequence voltages at the time of abrupt transition. This method can be applied to uninterruptable power supplies (UPS), pulsewidth modulation (PWM) AC/DC converters, active filters, AC voltage compensators etc.","1350-2360","","10.1049/ip-gtd:20000716","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=894405","","","PWM power convertors;AC-AC power convertors;parameter estimation;notch filters;low-pass filters;power factor;uninterruptible power supplies;least squares approximations;active filters;compensation","instantaneous phase-angle estimation algorithm;unbalanced voltage-sag conditions;oscillating error;synchronous reference frame;power conditioning equipment;positive sequence;unity power factor;constant output voltage;negative sequence;unbalance compensation;notch filter;low pass filter;narrow bandwidth;phase delay;response time;negative-sequence voltages;positive-sequence voltages;weighted least-squares estimation;covariance resetting technique;frequency update law;frequency varying environments;uninterruptable power supplies;UPS;pulsewidth modulation AC/DC converters;PWM AC/DC converters;active filters;AC voltage compensators","","79","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals"

The Electrostatically Supported Gyro (ESG), in production for over 25 years, is the most critical and costly component of the current inertial navigation system. ESGs, however, are extremely expensive to manufacture and repair. Furthermore, the system-level electronic components are difficult to replace because they are rapidly becoming obsolete. The current initiative is focused on containing total ownership costs, especially maintenance costs, without any relaxation of performance, reliability, or maintainability requirements. The key element of this initiative is new gyro technology based on rapidly improving precision Interferometric Fiber Optic Gyro IFOG performance, along with cost reduction of fiber and manufacturing processes.

Quantum mechanical calculations are performed to characterize some of the electrical properties of the proposed molecular diode switches. Explicit structural designs are displayed for AND, OR, and XOR gates that are built from molecular wires and molecular diode switches. The diode-based molecular electronic logic gates are combined to produce a design for a molecular-scale electronic half adder and a molecular-scale electronic full adder.

The switch design [named the low-frequency asynchronous switch design (LF-ASD)] is based on a new feature set related to imaginary movements in the 1-4 Hz frequency range. This new feature set was identified from a unique analysis of EEG using a bi-scale wavelet. Offline evaluations of a prototype switch demonstrated hit (true positive) rates in the range of 38%-81% with corresponding false positive rates in the range of 0.3%-11.6%. The performance of the LF-ASD was contrasted with two other ASDs: one based on mu-power features and another based on the outlier processing method (OPM) algorithm.

Although a number of SLAM implementations have appeared in the literature, the need to maintain the knowledge of the relative relationships between all the landmark location estimates contained in the map makes SLAM computationally intractable in implementations containing more than few tens of landmarks. In this paper, the theoretical basis and a practical implementation of a computationally efficient solution to SLAM is presented. The paper shows that it is indeed possible to remove a large percentage of the landmarks from the map without making the map-building process statistically inconsistent. Furthermore, it is shown that the efficiency of the SLAM can be maintained by judicious selection of landmarks, to be preserved in the map, based on their information content.","1050-4729","0-7803-5886-4","10.1109/ROBOT.2000.844732","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=844732","","Simultaneous localization and mapping;Remotely operated vehicles;Mobile robots;Uncertainty;Australia;Computational efficiency;Buildings;Large-scale systems;Navigation;Marine vehicles","estimation theory;mobile robots;computational complexity;position measurement","computationally efficient solution;localisation problem;map building problem;SLAM problem;landmark information content","","87","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Also, 5-hydroxy-methyl-cellulose was seen in the early stages of some experiments. The concentration of 2-furaldehyde (furfural) was found to be highest of all the products and the concentrations of all products increased exponentially with time to a maximum value and then decreased. The concentration of most products increased rapidly as the paper approached the end of its useful life, indicating that furfural analysis could provide a sensitive trouble-shooting tool for rapid ageing.

In the task setting, the profile of the Web surfer, the communication goal of the Web site and other quality aspects are taken into account.

The problem we address in this paper is how to develop an offline procedure to choose these gains. The main contribution of our work is a very simple frequency-domain test that, for each setting of the PI gains, evaluates the maximum range of the relative rotor resistance estimate for which global stability is guaranteed. In this way, we provide a quantitative estimate of the performance of the PI controller. The stability result may also be used in a dual manner, fixing now the range of the rotor resistance, and estimating an admissible interval for the PI gains that preserves global stability.

The Rockwell Collins SAASM has been designed as a common module that can be used to support all internal SAASM applications. Its architecture provides an advanced set of core functions while at the same time supporting easy integration into various applications. This paper presents the architecture, features, and status of the Rockwell Collins SAASM and describes three applications that incorporate this module, specifically, NavStrike/sup TM/, the small serial interface (SSI) receiver, and GPS Embedded Module (GEM) V/sup TM/. ""NavStrike"" is a very small, high A/J, high G, fast direct Y (DY), receiver specifically designed for precision guided munitions (PGM) applications. Through the use of a proprietary technique, this receiver provides unclassified GPS measurement data for use in tightly coupled integrations. Position, velocity and time (PVT) outputs are also available. NavStrike uses special features such as a high-speed serial interface, a unique frequency standard and a clock calibration mode to perform fast DY acquisitions after up to 20 years of storage. A SSI product is being developed using the common SAASM module. Among the users of this GPS technology are the ground (low dynamics, minimal environmental) applications that embed the GPS directly within their own equipment. The PVT data provided by the SSI receiver can be easily integrated with the host system providing additional navigation performance with minimal space and cost impact. This SSI module, which uses the new GPS receiver applications module (GRAM) SSI standard, is being designed to be a seamless drop in replacement of existing ground applications embedded receivers. GEM V is the most recent member of the GEM product line. The GEM receivers are designed for high performance, high dynamic embedded applications. GEM V is a SAASM-based module that features the high A/J characteristics and direct Y capabilities of previous GEM products. The GEM V/sup TM/ is integrated with a host system through a dual port RAM or a serial port (RS-422) interface. Once integrated, the GEM can perform as a fully functional guidance system, as a PVT engine, or as a GPS measurement sensor.","","0-7803-5872-4","10.1109/PLANS.2000.838289","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=838289","","Global Positioning System;Costs;Space technology;Weapons;Frequency;Clocks;Calibration;Navigation;Performance evaluation;Engines","Global Positioning System;radio receivers;military equipment;jamming;system buses;missile guidance","GPS receiver design;Rockwell Collins;military GPS supplier;Global Positioning System;Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module;SAASM;NavStrike;small serial interface receiver;SSI receiver;GPS Embedded Module V;fast direct Y receiver;precision guided munitions;unclassified GPS measurement data;position;velocity;time;high-speed serial interface;frequency standard;clock calibration mode;fast DY acquisition;ground applications;PVT data;navigation performance;GPS receiver applications module;SSI standard;antijamming characteristics;dual port RAM;serial port interface;RS-422 interface;guidance system;GPS measurement sensor","","1","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, a novel procedure is presented for synthesizing radar absorbing materials (RAM) for RCS reduction in a wide-band frequency range. The modal solutions of Maxwell's equations for the multilayered planar, cylindrical, and spherical canonical structures is integrated into a genetic algorithm (GA) optimization technique to obtain the best optimal composite coating. It Is shown that by using an optimal RAM, the RCS of these canonical structures can be significantly reduced. Characteristics of bistatic RCS of coated cylindrical and spherical structures are also studied and compared with the conducting structures without coating. It is shown that no optimal coating can be found to reduce the RCS in the deep shadow region. An in-depth study has been performed to evaluate the potential usage of the optimal planar coating as applied to the curved surfaces. It is observed that the optimal planar coating can noticeably reduce the RCS of the spherical structure. This observation was essential in introducing a novel efficient GA with hybrid planar/curved surface implementation using as part of its initial generation the best population obtained for the planar RAM design. These results suggest that the optimal RAM for a surface with arbitrary curvature may be efficiently determined by applying the GA with hybrid planar/curved surface population initialization.","1558-2221","","10.1109/8.899676","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=899676","","Genetic algorithms;Read-write memory;Coatings;Radar cross section;Conducting materials;Radar scattering;Frequency synthesizers;Maxwell equations;Electromagnetic scattering;Design optimization","radar cross-sections;electromagnetic wave scattering;electromagnetic wave absorption;genetic algorithms;Maxwell equations;inhomogeneous media;conducting bodies","RCS reduction;radar cross section;canonical targets;genetic algorithm synthesized RAM;planar conducting targets;cylindrical conducting targets;spherical conducting targets;radar absorbing materials;wide-band frequency range;modal solutions;Maxwell's equations;multilayered planar structures;optimal composite coating;optimal RAM;istatic RCS;conducting structures;deep shadow region;optimal planar coating;hybrid planar/curved surface;planar RAM design;population initialization","","56","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown that by using two levels of correlated-double sampling it is possible to effectively cancel all fixed-pattern noise due to read-out circuit mismatch. Instead the fixed-pattern noise performance of the sensor is limited by dark current nonuniformity at low signal levels, and conversion gain nonuniformity at high signal levels. It is further shown that the imaging performance of the sensor is comparable to low-end CCD sensors but inferior to that reported for high-end CCD sensors due to low quantum efficiency, high dark current, and pixel cross-talk. As such the performance of CMOS sensors is limited at the device level rather than at the architectural level. If the imaging performance issues can be addressed at the fabrication process level without increasing cost or degrading transistor performance, CMOS has the potential to seriously challenge CCD as the solid-state imaging technology of choice due to low power dissipation and compatibility with camera system integration.","1557-9646","","10.1109/16.817567","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=817567","","Image color analysis","CMOS image sensors;image colour analysis;semiconductor device noise;dark conductivity","color CMOS photogate image sensor;correlated-double sampling;fixed-pattern noise;read-out circuit mismatch;dark current nonuniformity;signal levels;conversion gain nonuniformity;quantum efficiency;pixel cross-talk;solid-state imaging technology;power dissipation;camera system integration","","43","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Software tools using such techniques may take considerable computation time in the analysis of the propagation conditions in a given environment even for a short mobile terminal route. Efficient acceleration techniques are required to make such analysis tools practical for the design of modern radio systems. To reduce computation time, ray-tracing routines must be applied only to those areas where rays are likely to exist. This is achieved by using ray-path search algorithms prior to performing any actual ray tracing. An efficient ray-path search algorithm is presented. First, a two-dimensional version is described, which is valid for indoor and microcell studies. Then, an extension to the three-dimensional case is explained in detail.

In this paper, an improved genetic algorithm incorporating a stochastic crossover technique and an artificial initial population scheme is developed to provide a faster search mechanism. The main advantage of the IGA approach is that the ""curse of dimensionality"" and a local optimal trap inherent in mathematical programming methods can be simultaneously overcome. The IGA approach is applied to two test systems, one with 15 existing power plants, 5 types of candidate plants and a 14-year planning period, and the other, a practical long-term system with a 24-year planning period.","1558-0679","","10.1109/59.871713","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=871713","","Genetic algorithms;Power system planning;Mathematical programming;Constraint optimization;Power generation;Stochastic processes;System testing;Decision making;Power industry;Capacity planning","power generation planning;genetic algorithms;mathematical programming","genetic algorithm;generation expansion planning;least-cost generation expansion planning;constrained nonlinear dynamic optimization;stochastic crossover technique;artificial initial population scheme;local optimal trap;mathematical programming methods","","121","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The converter topology comprises essentially a cascade combination of a discontinuous-mode boost converter and a continuous-mode forward converter. The proposed control utilizes variation of both duty cycle and frequency. The role of varying the duty cycle is mainly to regulate the output voltage. Changing the frequency, moreover, can achieve unity power factor as well as low-voltage stress. Basically, the switching frequency is controlled such that it has a time periodic component superposed on top of a static value. While the time periodic component removes the harmonic contents of the input current, the static value is adjusted according to the load condition so as to maintain a sufficiently low-voltage stress across the storage capacitor. The theory is first presented which shows the possibility of meeting all three requirements using a combined duty cycle and frequency control. An experimental prototype circuit is presented to verify the controller's functions.","1941-0107","","10.1109/63.817373","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=817373","","Regulators;Voltage control;Reactive power;Capacitors;Stress control;Topology;Switching frequency;Frequency control;Prototypes;Circuits","power factor correction;transient response;DC-DC power convertors;switching circuits;voltage control;frequency control;power conversion harmonics;control system synthesis","single-stage single-switch isolated PFC regulator;unity power factor;fast transient response;low-voltage stress;fast output voltage regulation;voltage stress;storage capacitor;converter topology;cascade combination;discontinuous-mode boost converter;continuous-mode forward converter;output voltage regulation;switching frequency control;combined duty cycle;analog integrated circuits;power conversion harmonics;controller design","","49","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The control strategies for the output DC voltage and input AC current are also presented and discussed. To achieve sinusoidal input current and high power factor, sliding-mode control of the input current is proposed. This nonlinear control strategy, applied to this single-phase step-up/down type AC-DC converter, also reduces the size, weight and cost of the DC inductor.

The mixed integer linear programming problem to be solved at each iteration of the procedure is tackled by applying both a deterministic method (branch and bound) and genetic algorithm techniques.

It was expected that the perceived quality, depth, and sharpness would be relatively unaffected by low-pass filtering, compared to the case where both eyes viewed a filtered image. Subjects viewed two 10-second stereo video-sequences, in which the right-eye frames were filtered vertically (V) and horizontally (H) at 1/2 H, 1/2 V, 1/4 H, 1/4 V, 1/2 H 1/2 V, 1/2 H 1/4 V, 1/4 H 1/2 V, and 1/4 H 1/4 V resolution. Temporal filtering was implemented for a subset of these conditions at 1/2 temporal resolution, or with drop-and-repeat frames. Subjects rated the overall quality, sharpness, and overall sensation of depth. It was found that spatial filtering produced acceptable results: the overall sensation of depth was unaffected by low-pass filtering, while ratings of quality and of sharpness were strongly weighted towards the eye with the greater spatial resolution. By comparison, temporal filtering produced unacceptable results: field averaging and drop-and-repeat frame conditions yielded images with poor quality and sharpness, even though perceived depth was relatively unaffected.

Because of its small input to output voltage drop, the charge pump circuit supports a wide range of supply voltages and is ideal for powering high side circuitry with low voltage requirements. A model for the operation of the charge pump is derived, which offers an improvement over previous models by accounting for the effect of a load current and which includes a variable pump oscillator duty term and current dependent diode models to allow for a more accurate prediction of the charge pump behavior. More importantly, the model also predicts the critical effects of switching transients at the output of the half-bridge on the charge pump.

Di Benedetto","Dept. of Marketing & Supply Chain Manage., Michigan State Univ., East Lansing, MI, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management","","2000","47","2","232","244","Windows of opportunity and product life cycles have been shortening, placing pressure on firms to stay competitive. Many firms have responded to this pressure by setting goals of reducing new product development (NPD) cycle time and/or improving product performance, often by setting up fuzzy gates between stages, cross-functional teams, or both. This study examines the tradeoff between product performance and time to market, focusing on the effect of overlapping stages during which marketing, design, and manufacturing engineering are jointly working on performance improvement, An NPD process model comprising a design stage, a process stage, and an intermediary overlap stage representing the interaction between design and process personnel is developed. Key findings include the following. (1) Overlapping stages reduces time to market, but the marginal returns to lengthening the overlap stage yield progressively smaller improvements in time to market. (2) The longer the market window is open, the less is the pressure to rush the product to market, and product performance can be further improved by leaving the product longer in development. (3) It is better to keep the product longer in development rather than accelerate time to market if the base product performance is low. (4) If the productivity of the overlap stage is increased, it is more profitable to keep the product in development longer and boost product performance at launch than to rush the product to market quicker. (5) The greater the market power the firm possesses, the faster it should bring the product to market, as long as product performance and sustainability of market power are not substantially reduced. A set of propositions is derived from the model, and is tested in a small-scale empirical study on firms in the automobile and automotive supply industry. The results are largely supportive of the propositions. Management implications and recommendations for further research are presented.","1558-0040","","10.1109/17.846790","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=846790","","Product development","automobile industry;product development;management;marketing","overlapping stages;time to market;cycle time acceleration;product life cycles;windows of opportunity;new product development cycle time reduction;product performance improvement;fuzzy gates;cross-functional teams;marketing;design;manufacturing engineering;design stage;process stage;intermediary overlap stage;process personnel;marginal returns;overlap stage productivity;market power sustainability;automotive supply industry;automobile supply industry;management implications","","80","","47","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This has been shown to give a harmonic performance equivalent to APOD modulation of a NPC multilevel inverter, when the switching frequencies are scaled to achieve the same number of overall switch transitions. In contrast, PD modulation of a NPC inverter is harmonically superior, because it places harmonic energy directly into the carrier harmonic for each phase leg, and relies on cancellation of this harmonic across phase legs as the line-to-line voltage is developed. Using this understanding, a new discontinuous modulation strategy is proposed for a hybrid inverter which achieves a similar level of improvement in line-to-line harmonics compared to conventional three level modulation of this type of inverter.","0197-2618","0-7803-6401-5","10.1109/IAS.2000.883114","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=883114","","Pulse width modulation inverters;Voltage;Leg;Switches;Topology;Bridge circuits;Frequency conversion;Systems engineering and theory;Drives;Switching frequency","power conversion harmonics;harmonics suppression;PWM invertors","modulation strategy;hybrid multilevel inverter;three level bipolar PWM;multilevel cascaded inverter;carriers phase shift;maximum harmonic cancellation;phase leg;harmonic performance;switching frequencies;carrier harmonic;harmonic cancellation;line-to-line voltage;discontinuous modulation strategy;line-to-line harmonics;three level modulation","","26","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The transmission and reflection coefficients were calculated using a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solution of Maxwell's equations. The rebar structures analyzed include both a two-dimensional (2-D) trellis-like structure and a one-dimensional (1-D) structure, where the reenforcing bars are all oriented in the same direction. In general, the results show that the reinforced concrete structures severely attenuate signals with wavelengths that are much larger than the rebar lattice and that the transmitted signal has a complex structure with resonances and nulls that strongly depend upon the geometry of the reinforcing structure and the concrete wall thickness.","1558-187X","","10.1109/15.902318","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=902318","","Radio communication equipment","radio equipment;electromagnetic wave absorption;electromagnetic wave transmission;electromagnetic wave reflection;finite difference time-domain analysis;concrete;VHF radio propagation;UHF radio propagation;microwave propagation","reinforced concrete structures;RF communication systems;communication systems;man-made structures;reflection properties;transmission properties;building materials;radio frequencies;businesses;residential environments;transmission coefficient;reflection coefficient;reinforced concrete walls;wall thickness;rebar lattice configuration;finite-difference time-domain;FDTD solution;Maxwell's equations;2D trellis-like structure;1D structure;reenforcing bars;signal attenuation;wavelengths;transmitted signal;resonances;nulls;VHF;UHF;SHF;100 to 6000 MHz","","74","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As different definitions are used worldwide, the paper briefly discusses the definition of DG. The future development of DG, however, will, to a not insignificant part, depend on the legal framework. As the legal framework can vary significantly for different competitive electricity markets, this paper briefly identifies and analyses some variations in the regulatory approaches, e.g. for power exchanges, balance services and ancillary services, in different countries. It also illustrates the influence of market regulations on the development of distributed power generation. Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that regulatory aspects might decisively influence the development of distributed power generation.","","0-7803-5902-X","10.1109/DRPT.2000.855735","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=855735","","Electricity supply industry;Distributed control;Distributed power generation;Power generation;Wind energy generation;Law;Legal factors;Australia;Wind farms;Power engineering and energy","electricity supply industry;legislation;electric power generation","electricity market regulations;distributed generation impact;legal framework;competitive electricity markets;regulatory approaches;power exchanges;balance services;ancillary services;regulatory aspects","","44","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Introducing the capacitor-diode based multistage voltage multiplier, the secondary turn numbers and stray capacitance of the high-voltage high-frequency transformer as well as the rectifier diode voltage ratings can be greatly reduced. It is proven that the proposed converter control scheme of the 2 step frequency selected switching is more effective for improving output voltage responses.

We present an original hierarchical segmentation procedure devoted to images given by a high-resolution sonar. The sonar image is segmented into two kinds of regions: shadow (corresponding to a lack of acoustic reverberation behind each object lying on the sea-bed) and sea-bottom reverberation. The proposed unsupervised scheme takes into account the variety of the laws in the distribution mixture of a sonar image, and it estimates both the parameters of noise distributions and the parameters of the Markovian prior. For the estimation step, we use an iterative technique which combines a maximum likelihood approach (for noise model parameters) with a least-squares method (for MRF-based prior). In order to model more precisely the local and global characteristics of image content at different scales, we introduce a hierarchical model involving a pyramidal label field. It combines coarse-to-fine causal interactions with a spatial neighborhood structure. This new method of segmentation, called the scale causal multigrid (SCM) algorithm, has been successfully applied to real sonar images and seems to be well suited to the segmentation of very noisy images. The experiments reported in this paper demonstrate that the discussed method performs better than other hierarchical schemes for sonar image segmentation.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.847834","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=847834","","Image segmentation;Reverberation;Sonar applications;Parameter estimation;Acoustic waves;Markov random fields;Acoustic noise;Iterative methods;Maximum likelihood detection;Maximum likelihood estimation","sonar imaging;image segmentation;Markov processes;random processes;image resolution;maximum likelihood estimation;least squares approximations;reverberation;noise;unsupervised learning","sonar image segmentation;unsupervised hierarchical MRF model;hierarchical Markov random field;hierarchical segmentation;high-resolution sonar;shadow;sea-bed;sea-bottom reverberation;distribution mixture;parameter estimation;noise distributions;Markovian prior;iterative technique;maximum likelihood estimation;noise model parameters;least-squares method;global characteristics;local characteristics;hierarchical model;pyramidal label field;spatial neighborhood structure;coarse-to-fine causal interactions;scale causal multigrid algorithm;noisy images;experiments","","150","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, we propose a small-scaled (about 5-10 kW output) generating system. This system has the advantage of system flexibility against the large one. But the small-scale system has a weak point of system efficiency. Then, we have to construct a simple and inexpensive system. Because of the erratic change of wind power, an AC/DC converter-fed system is recommended. Therefore, we adopt a compact permanent magnet type, synchronous generator which doesn't need exciting current, and step up/down buck boost chopper to wind power generating system without position or speed sensor. In addition, we employ an inexpensive rectifier circuit using a diode bridge instead of an AC/DC converter with a PWM method. Using these methods we achieve a simple and inexpensive wind power generating system.

To solve the economic dispatch problem using the Hopfield model, an energy function composing power mismatch, total fuel cost and the transmission line losses is defined. The weighting factors associated with the terms of the energy function can be either appropriately selected or directly estimated in the proposed model. Which, however, are determined by trial and error in the conventional Hopfield method. To minimize the value of the energy function, the computational procedures including a series of adjusting the weighting factor associated with the transmission line losses and updating the unit generations and power losses are carried out. Because the weighting factors are governed by some relationships developed, adjustment of the weighting factor is much simpler and more effective in steadily achieving solutions than adjustment of the /spl lambda/-multiplier in the lambda-iteration method for economic dispatch problems. Computational results reveal that this approach can find accurate solutions more simply and fast compared with the conventional lambda-iteration method.","1558-0679","","10.1109/59.867138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=867138","","Power generation economics;Fuel economy;Propagation losses;Power generation;Power system modeling;Power transmission lines;Power system economics;Cost function;Neurons","power system economics;power system analysis computing;load dispatching;Hopfield neural nets;iterative methods;losses;power transmission lines","Hopfield modeling framework;economic dispatch;energy function;power mismatch;total fuel cost;transmission line losses;weighting factors;power losses;unit generations updating;/spl lambda/-multiplier;lambda-iteration method;sigmoidal function","","108","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper describes a method for determining the ATC between any two locations in a transmission system (single-area or multiarea) under a given set of system operating conditions. The method also provides ATCs for selected transmission paths between the two locations in the system and identifies the most limiting facilities in determining the network's ATC. In addition, the method can be used to compute multiple ATCs between more than one pair of locations. The proposed method is illustrated using the IEEE reliability test system (RTS).","1558-0679","","10.1109/59.852097","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=852097","","Area measurement;Power measurement;Time measurement;Power generation;Network topology;Thermal factors;Thermal loading;Voltage;Thermal stability;System testing","transmission networks;power generation dispatch;load distribution","available transfer capability;transmission systems;unutilized capability;system generation dispatch;system load level;load distribution;power transfers;network topology;stability considerations;voltage considerations;thermal considerations;multiarea transmission system;IEEE reliability test system","","131","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The closed-form expressions introduced here consider all damping conditions of an RLC circuit including the underdamped response, which is not considered by the Elmore delay due to the nonmonotone nature of the response. The continuous analytical nature of the solutions makes these expressions suitable for design methodologies and optimization techniques.

It was determined that nonlinearities of the on-chip varactors, which led to excessively high VCO gain at the bottom of the tuning range, were primarily responsible for this degradation in performance. The VCO has a power output of -5 dBm per side. Calculations predict phase noise with only a small error and provide design insight for minimizing this effect.

We present a new application for FSS. For the former applications, FSS are free standing or backed by a perfect dielectric. It can be also embedded into a dielectric medium or sandwiched between different dielectric media. In the new application, FSS are used as components of radar absorbing materials (RAM). Classical RAM are composed of several layers of dielectric or magnetic media. For example, the two most famous absorbing screens are the Dallenbach and the Salisbury screens. The first is a short circuited lossy dielectric (or magnetic) layer, while the second is composed of two layers. The Salisbury screen consists of a thin resistive film deposited on a perfect metal-backed dielectric layer. We show how a FSS can modify and improve the absorption performance of Dallenbach screens. The FSS is deposited on the outer surface of the Dallenbach screen in this new application. We show numerically that the absorption band can be either shifted or broadened by the presence of an FSS. We illustrate the numerical results with measurements. The theoretical aspects of the computation of the interaction between the electromagnetic field and the structure are discussed, and the properties of the new absorbing screen are examined.","","0-7803-6369-8","10.1109/APS.2000.875349","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=875349","","Frequency selective surfaces;Optical filters;Dielectric losses;Microwave antennas;Multiplexing;Microwave filters;Filtering;Optical films;Radar applications;Dielectric materials","microstrip antenna arrays;inhomogeneous media;frequency selective surfaces;electromagnetic wave absorption","thin electromagnetic absorber;frequency selective surfaces;antennas applications;beams multiplexer;microwave signals filtering;optical signals filtering;dielectric media;radar absorbing materials;RAM;magnetic media;absorbing screens;Salisbury screen;Dallenbach screen;short circuited lossy dielectric layer;thin resistive film;perfect metal-backed dielectric layer;absorption performance;absorption band;measurements;electromagnetic field;absorbing screen;periodic patch array","","10","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Leveraging legacy system dollars for e-business","L.

Most companies want to transform their applications to meet new business demands, but because legacy systems tend to be unwieldy, monolithic, and inflexible, many firms regard modernization as somewhere between improbable and impossible. Reeling from the Y2K debacle and saddled with years of application backlog, the most these companies can hope for is to keep their legacy system alive. And keeping it alive is getting more expensive. It is also becoming harder to find qualified personnel to do the maintenance. All of this makes it difficult to add new functionality and keep up with business requirements. The ideal solution is to transform legacy systems to newer, more productive platforms so that companies can exploit faster and cheaper development technologies, like Java and XML (Extensible Markup Language). The focus then shifts to functionality, not the infrastructure, which means a company can respond more quickly to its changing business requirements and technology enhancements. RescueWare, legacy transformation software from Relativity Technologies, breaks business knowledge into stand-alone pieces, or e-components.

The proposed machine can offer a large constant-power speed range, high-efficiency and high-power-factor operation in comparison to the complete synchronous reluctance motor. It was shown that the problems such as the decrease of efficiency at light-loads and the uncontrolled generator mode operation, which occur in the high-speed flux-weakening operation of the conventional PM motor drives, can be eliminated in the PM assisted synchronous reluctance motor.","0197-2618","0-7803-6401-5","10.1109/IAS.2000.881158","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=881158","","Reluctance motors;Permanent magnet motors;Torque;Rotors;Prototypes;Synchronous motors;Voltage;Magnetic analysis;Testing;Stators","permanent magnet motors;rotors;reluctance motor drives;magnetic flux;power factor","PM assisted synchronous reluctance motor;high efficiency;wide constant power operation;magnets;rotor;high-power-factor operation;light-loads;uncontrolled generator mode operation;high-speed flux-weakening operation;PM motor drives","","7","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To be precise, security measures are there to limit the negative impact of engaging in commercial transactions over some electronic medium. Many commercial transactions have impact outside the e-world, and thus e-commerce security also needs to extend its basis beyond technical measures.

Al wire bonds degrade with the increase of crack length during thermal fatigue tests with high /spl Delta/T/sub j/ due to the tensile stress generated by the thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between Al wires and Si. It is also found that cracks propagate along the small grain boundaries of Al wires at the bonding interface. It is predicted that the Al wire bonds may not degrade due to thermal fatigue if /spl Delta/T/sub j/ is controlled below 40 K, i.e., keeping it within the actual temperature fluctuation range in IGBT modules for traction motor drives.

The adaptive part of the system tries to determine the controller parameters during operation in real-time mode, whereas the dual part of it realises this actively by means of optimal excitation added to the cautious control action. Therefore adaptive dual controllers provide a number of advantages compared to the classical adaptive control schemes: (i) the accuracy of the estimation is taken into account, (ii) an optimal excitation for speeding up the estimation is provided, and (iii) the adaptation time becomes shorter and provides a smooth transitional behaviour. The paper reviews the historical stages of the development of theory and application of dual adaptive control methods elaborated from the early 60's till today, considering also its close interconnection with the general progress in adaptive control systems. Detailed classifications of stochastic adaptive control methods and their adaptive dual versions are presented.

A dynamic bit allocation among VOs is implemented according to the coding complexities for each VO. SRC achieves more accurate bit allocation with low latency and limited buffer size. In a single framework, SRC offers multiple layers of controls for objects, frames, and macroblocks (MBs). At MB level, SRC provides finer bit rate and buffer control.

An appropriate electronic circuitry measures the magnetic field by quantifying the displacement of the conducting beam. In order to increase sensitivity to magnetic fields, the magnitude of the deflection is increased by resonant operation in a vacuum ambient. The sensor obtains its vacuum environment by encapsulation with a new wafer bonding process. Prototype sensors with resonant frequencies in the range around 1300 Hz show Q-factors above 30.

Surface electromyography from medial and lateral erector spinae, and latissimus dorsi locations were processed using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and wavelet transform. Linear regression quantified the time rate of change of median frequency as well as frequency specific STFT filter and wavelet scale measures. The median frequency from the short-time Fourier transform declined by 22 Hz/min from an initial value of 77 Hz on average.

This paper proposes an effective approach to data-based fuzzy modeling of high-dimensional systems. An initial fuzzy rule system is generated based on the conclusion that optimal fuzzy rules cover extrema. Redundant rules are removed based on a fuzzy similarity measure. Then, the structure and parameters of the fuzzy system are optimized using a genetic algorithm and the gradient method. During optimization, rules that have a very low firing strength are deleted. Finally, interpretability of the fuzzy system is improved by fine training the fuzzy rules with regularization. The resulting fuzzy system generated by this method has the following distinct features: (1) the fuzzy system is quite simplified; (2) the fuzzy system is interpretable; and (3) the dependencies between the inputs and the output are clearly shown. This method has successfully been applied to a system that has 11 inputs and one output with 20 000 training data and 80 000 test data.","1941-0034","","10.1109/91.842154","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=842154","","Fuzzy systems;Genetic algorithms;Buildings;Optimization methods;Gradient methods;Training data;System testing;Explosions;Input variables;Partitioning algorithms","modelling;fuzzy systems;multidimensional systems;computational complexity;redundancy;genetic algorithms;gradient methods","fuzzy modeling;high-dimensional systems;complexity reduction;interpretability improvement;data-based fuzzy modeling;initial fuzzy rule system;optimal fuzzy rules;redundant rules;fuzzy similarity measure;fuzzy system structure optimization;fuzzy system parameter optimization;genetic algorithm;gradient method;fuzzy system interpretability;fine training;regularization","","317","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Eng., Technion-Israel Inst. of Technol., Haifa, Israel; NA","IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","","2000","46","4","1401","1425","Shannon-theoretic limits on the achievable throughput for a simple infinite cellular multiple-access channel (MAC) model (Wyner 1994) in the presence of fading are presented. In this model, which is modified to account for flat fading, the received signal, at a given cell-site's antenna, is the sum of the faded signals transmitted from all users within that cell plus an attenuation factor /spl alpha//spl isin/[0,1] times the sum of the faded signals received from the adjacent cells, accompanied by Gaussian additive noise. This model serves as a tractable model providing considerable insight into complex and analytically intractable real-world cellular communications. Both linear and planar cellular arrays are considered with exactly K active users in each cell. We assume a hyper-receiver, jointly decoding all of the users, incorporating the received signals from all of the active cell-sites. The hyper-receiver is assumed to be aware of the codebooks and realizations of the fading processes of all the users in the system. In this work we consider the intracell time-division multiple-access (TDMA) and the wideband (WB) protocols. We focus on the maximum reliably transmitted equal rate. Bounds to this rate are found for the intracell TDMA protocol by incorporating information-theoretic inequalities and the Chebyshev-Markov moment theory as applied to the limiting distribution of the eigenvalues of a quadratic form of tridiagonal random matrices. We demonstrate our results for the special case where the amplitudes of the fading coefficients are drawn from a Rayleigh distribution, i.e., Rayleigh fading. For this special case, we observe the rather surprising result that fading may increase the maximum equal rate, for a certain range of /spl alpha/ as compared to the nonfaded case. In this setting, the WB strategy, which achieves the maximum reliable equal rate of the model, is proved to be superior to the TDMA scheme. An upper bound to the maximum equal rate of the WB scheme is also obtained. This bound is asymptotically tight when the number of users is large (K/spl Gt/1). The asymptotic bound shows that the maximum equal rate of the WB scheme in the presence of fading is higher than the rate which corresponds to the nonfaded case for any intercell interference factor /spl alpha//spl isin/[0,1] signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values. This result is found to be independent of the statistics of the fading coefficients.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.850679","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=850679","","Rayleigh channels","Rayleigh channels;cellular radio;linear antenna arrays;information theory;time division multiple access;Gaussian channels;multiuser channels;access protocols;radio receivers","Shannon-theoretic approach;Gaussian cellular multiple-access channel;fading;achievable throughput;infinite cellular multiple-access channel model;MAC model;flat fading;attenuation factor;adjacent cells;Gaussian additive noise;tractable model;real-world cellular communications;linear cellular arrays;planar cellular arrays;hyper-receiver;decoding;codebooks;intracell time-division multiple-access;TDMA;wideband protocols;WB protocol;maximum reliably transmitted equal rate;information-theoretic inequalities;Chebyshev-Markov moment theory;Rayleigh distribution;Rayleigh fading;maximum equal rate;maximum reliable equal rate;intercell interference factor;signal-to-noise ratio","","135","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This work proposes an algorithm to optimally estimate the overall distortion of decoder frame reconstruction due to quantization, error propagation, and error concealment. The method recursively computes the total decoder distortion at pixel level precision to accurately account for spatial and temporal error propagation. The accuracy of the estimate is demonstrated via simulation results. The estimate is integrated into a rate-distortion (RD)-based framework for optimal switching between intra-coding and inter-coding modes per macroblock. The cost in computational complexity is modest. The framework is further extended to optimally exploit feedback/acknowledgment information from the receiver/network. Simulation results both with and without a feedback channel demonstrate that precise distortion estimation enables the coder to achieve substantial and consistent gains in PSNR over known state-of-the-art RD- and non-RD-based mode switching methods.","1558-0008","","10.1109/49.848250","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=848250","","Video coding;Packet switching;Decoding;Computational modeling;Resilience;Propagation losses;Degradation;Quantization;Rate-distortion;Computational efficiency","video coding;data compression;packet switching;optimisation;rate distortion theory;telecommunication networks;quantisation (signal);computational complexity;feedback;decoding;image reconstruction","packet-switched networks;optimal inter/intra-mode switching;packet loss resilience;predictive video coding;video transmission;prediction loop errors;video quality;algorithm;decoder frame reconstruction;quantization;simulation results;error concealment;decoder distortion;pixel level precision;spatial error propagation;temporal error propagation;optimal switching;intra-coding;inter-coding;computational complexity;feedback/acknowledgment information;feedback channel;distortion estimation;PSNR;nonrate distortion-based mode switching;rate distortion-based mode switching","","508","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Degradation of insulating materials under electrical stress","C. Mayoux","Lab. de Genie Electr., Univ. Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France","IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","","2000","7","5","590","601","An avalanche of physical and physicochemical phenomena, often self-sustained, leads to the end of life of an insulating material. The collapse of the insulating role of a material is mostly due to the electrical field stress. The path leading from the catastrophic situation, the breakdown, back to its origin is followed in the present paper. A defect, pre-existing or created by the in-service stresses, gives rise to an ionization process in a volume bounded by insulating walls. With time the process does not remain identical due to both changes in the material and gas evolution, which makes it difficult to interpret the detected electrical signal. The end of life will occur through microcracks in which new discharges are initiated, activating the propagation of these structural failures. This change of structure of the insulating material when due to the existence of water molecules will lead to the same kind of final degradation.

From polymers of low complexity such as the PE used in cables, assuming that there is no pre-existing defect, one endeavors to understand how a microstructure reacts with a local field or accumulated charges.

The combiner is based on a double antipodal finline-to-microstrip transition structure, which also serves as a two-way power combiner. The proposed 1/spl times/2 combining structure was analyzed and optimized by finite-element-method (FEM)-simulations and experiments. An optimized 1/spl times/2 power combiner showed a very low back-to-back insertion loss of 0.6 dB and return losses better than 17 dB over most of Ka-band. The resonant behavior of the combiner was also identified and analyzed using an FEM simulator. The two-way power-combining approach was extended to four-way (2/spl times/2) power combining by vertical stacking inside the waveguide. No degradation in the combining efficiency was observed during this process, demonstrating the scalability of the proposed approach. The implemented 1/spl times/2 power module that combines two 1-W monolithic-microwave integrated-circuit (MMIC) PAs showed an output power of 1.6 W and a combining efficiency of 83% around 24 GHz. The 2/spl times/2 PA module combining the four 1-W MMICs showed an output power of 3.3 W together with an almost identical combining efficiency.

Control is executed in a,b-coordinates (stator frame) and transformation is performed only with the use of observed transformation angle of rotor flux. The proposed approach addresses the problems of torque and flux control without the measurement of the speed of the motor, i.e. speed sensorless drive. Such a control strategy differs from the conventional field oriented control approach. The torque and the stator and rotor flux are controlled instead of the components of stator current i/sub sd/ and i/sub sq/.

Rescuers are under extreme time pressure; after 48 hours, victim mortality drastically increases owing to exposure and lack of food, water, and medical treatment. Rescuing can be as dangerous to the workers and the victims as the initial event. Moving through the structure or widening entry points for humans and equipment can cause further collapse, injuring or killing the trapped survivors or rescuers. Gas leaks and explosions are also possible. Rescue dogs can help reduce human risk and can enter smaller voids in the rubble than a human can, but they cannot replace a video camera or structural assessment equipment. Lightweight mobile robots could benefit USAR while reducing the risk to humans and dogs. For example, they could: conduct tedious searches for survivors with a level of rigor that is normally fatiguing to humans; insert specialized sensors into the rubble and position them; collect visual and seismic data to assess structural damage; deposit radio transmitters or small amounts of food and medication with the survivors; guide the insertion of jaws-of-life tools, and identify the location of limbs to prevent workers from damaging a victim's arm or leg during extraction.

Since 1980, a three-way catalyst (TWC) has been used to convert harmful emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen into less harmful gases in order to meet these regulations. The TWC's efficiency of conversion of these gases is primarily dependent on the mass ratio of air to fuel (A/F) in the mixture leaving the exhaust manifold and entering the catalyst, the velocity of the exhaust mass, and the temperature of the catalyst. The goal of the paper is to develop a dynamic control-oriented model of a TWC. First, the measurement capabilities are described.

Usually, by increasing or decreasing the duty ratio of on-state of switching device, the maximum power point is tracked. The variation of duty ratio is determined by considering its circuit parameters. However, it is known that actual capacitance of an electrolytic capacitor in parallel with the photovoltaic array has 50% tolerance of its nominal value. If the variation of duty ratio is determined based on its nominal value, the performance of the MPPT is degraded. Thus, we must change the variation of the duty ratio accordingly, based on its actual value. In the system presented, the model reference adaptive system is adapted to identify the capacitor, so the capacitance can be accurately estimated and the variation of the duty ratio can be corrected by the estimated value. As a result, the high performance of the MPPT may be obtained. Experimental results are presented using a proposed power inverter using buck-boost chopper circuits.","1350-2352","","10.1049/ip-epa:20000641","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=894417","","","photovoltaic power systems;capacitance;parameter estimation;invertors;choppers (circuits);electrolytic capacitors","maximum power point tracking;capacitor identifier;photovoltaic power system;observation method;perturbation method;switching device on-state;duty ratio decrease;electrolytic capacitor;capacitance estimation;model reference adaptive system;power inverter;buck-boost chopper circuits","","58","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals"

Eng., Duke Univ., Durham, NC, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Reliability","","2000","49","1","37","48","Perhaps the most stringent restriction in most software reliability models is the assumption of statistical independence among successive software failures. The authors research was motivated by the fact that although there are practical situations in which this assumption could be easily violated, much of the published literature on software reliability modeling does not seriously address this issue. The research work in this paper is devoted to developing the software reliability modeling framework that can consider the phenomena of failure correlation and to study its effects on the software reliability measures. The important property of the developed Markov renewal modeling approach is its flexibility. It allows construction of the software reliability model in both discrete time and continuous time, and (depending on the goals) to base the analysis either on Markov chain theory or on renewal process theory. Thus, their modeling approach is an important step toward more consistent and realistic modeling of software reliability. It can be related to existing software reliability growth models. Many input-domain and time-domain models can be derived as special cases under the assumption of failure s-independence. This paper aims at showing that the classical software reliability theory can be extended to consider a sequence of possibly s-dependent software runs, viz, failure correlation. It does not deal with inference nor with predictions, per se. For the model to be fully specified and applied to estimations and predictions in real software development projects, we need to address many research issues, e.g., the detailed assumptions about the nature of the overall reliability growth, way modeling-parameters change as a result of the fault-removal attempts.","1558-1721","","10.1109/24.855535","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=855535","","Software reliability;Software testing;Mathematical model;Predictive models;System testing;Software measurement;Time domain analysis;Programming;Materials requirements planning;Random variables","software reliability;failure analysis;correlation methods;Markov processes","software reliability models;failure correlation;Markov renewal modeling approach;Markov chain theory;renewal process theory;software reliability growth models;input-domain models;time-domain models;reliability growth","","60","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A commonly used high voltage component of these circuits is the lateral double diffused MOS transistor (LDMOS). The LDMOS transistor is based on the lightly doped drain concept. Two of the main objectives in designing LDMOS devices are to minimize the on-resistance while still maintaining a high breakdown voltage. Attempts to model LDMOS devices are complicated by the existence of the lightly doped drain and by the extension of the gate oxide and polysilicon beyond the channel into this region. This lightly doped drain region can have a large effect on the on-resistance, saturation current and feedback capacitance of the device.

Simulation results show a number of advantages of the proposed amplifier over the CDA, in particular, that the available gain can be increased by increasing the Zo/sub int/ of the amplifier stages. Simulation predicts that gains approaching 50 dB could be achieved by appropriate design modification. Measured results for implementation of the two versions of the 4-CSSDA are reported.

The capacitances of structures composed by one, two, or three lines on a ground plane are then written as a weighted sum of such elements. Since the elementary terms already account for the correct geometrical dependencies, very few numerical simulations have been required to tailor the formulas, attaining an accuracy higher than previously known results, over a wide range of the geometrical parameters of the lines.","1557-9646","","10.1109/16.817589","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=817589","","Capacitance","capacitance;integrated circuit interconnections;delays;VLSI;microstrip lines;integrated circuit design","2D interconnect capacitances;conformal mapping method;physically-based approach;ground plane;weighted sum;geometrical dependencies","","83","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The theoretical curve of the overall equivalent noise voltage spectral density at frequencies from 0.5 Hz to 50 kHz has good correlation to a measured experimental curve. The contribution of the different noise sources to the overall noise is shown. For modern low-noise JFET's, 1/f noise prevails over the channel thermal noise at frequencies f/spl les/100 Hz. When using high-capacitance-type signal source impedance, contribution of the biasing resistor thermal noise to the overall noise predominates at low frequencies f/spl ges/1 kHz and room temperature.

The ECG signal is first denoised by a soft or hard threshold with limitation of 99.99 reconstructs ability and then each PQRST cycle is decomposed into a coefficients vector by the optimal wavelet function.

It is shown that by the use of dither having a suitably chosen probability density function, moments of the total error can be made independent of the system input signal but that statistical independence of the error and the input signals is not achievable. Similarly, it is demonstrated that values of the total error signal cannot generally be rendered statistically independent of one another but that their joint moments can be controlled and that, in particular, the error sequence can be rendered spectrally white. The properties of some practical dither signals are explored, and recommendations are made for dithering in audio, video, and measurement applications.

Our experiments on NMOS noise measurements were done from subthreshold to saturation region of operation for both long-channel (5 /spl mu/m) and short-channel (as small as 0.6 /spl mu/m) NMOS transistors. The results suggest that for both types that in the saturation region, the flicker noise is due to the surface state effect and the noise equations, NLEV=2 and 3, in SPICE, HSPICE, and PSPICE are most appropriate. For short-channel devices, due to the effects of velocity saturation and the resulting nonlinear transconductance (g/sub m/) variation with gate bias voltage, the input-referred voltage noise increases as the gate-source voltage increases instead of staying constant as it does for long-channel devices. In the subthreshold region, the input-referred voltage noise decreases drastically as the gate-source voltage increases for both long-channel and short-channel NMOS devices. Simulations have been done using PSPICE and HSPICE, with noise level (NLEV)=3 and device model level 3 and BSIM 3.2 and 3.3.

We assume that the channel is known at the receiver and the existence of a feedback path to the transmitter. For a particular channel realization, we show that the judicious use of fewer transmit antennas when the channel matrix is ill-conditioned can increase system capacity. We develop a criterion for selecting an optimum set of transmit antennas. This selection is optimal in the sense that the capacity of the resulting MEA system is greater than that for any other configuration with the same number of transmit antennas chosen from the original set.

In the proposed SVPWM strategy, it is possible to eliminate one common mode voltage pulse in every control period by shifting the active voltage vectors of the inverter to align to those of the boost rectifier. Thus, a reduction in the total number of common mode voltage pulses and RMS motor leakage current can be obtained without extra hardware. Since the proposed SVPWM strategy can be simply implemented in software, it is widely applicable regardless of the power capacity of the converter and results in no increment of converter volume, weight and price. Moreover, because the proposed SVPWM strategy maintains the magnitude of the active voltage vector required for motor control and simply changes the distribution of the zero, voltage vector, it does not effect the control performance of the power converter.","1941-0107","","10.1109/63.892824","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=892824","","Rectifiers;Space vector pulse width modulation;Pulse width modulation inverters;Pulse inverters;Leakage current;Voltage control;Hardware;Breakdown voltage;Motor drives;AC motors","voltage control;PWM power convertors;PWM invertors;switching circuits;AC motor drives","common mode voltage reduction;boost rectifier/inverter system;active voltage vector shift;control period;common mode voltage pulses reduction;synchronized switching sequence;RMS motor leakage current;power capacity;motor control;AC motor drive","","33","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper we derive a new method which handles the corresponding case when the channel suffers from intersymbol interference. The intersymbol interference can be caused by partial response modulation and/or delay spread in the propagation channel. As in Alamouti's paper, we show that with two transmit and one receive antenna, the same diversity can be achieved as with one transmit and two receive antennas.

The utility of Golay complementary sequences in solving this problem has been recognized for some time. In this paper, a powerful theory linking Golay complementary sets of polyphase sequences and Reed-Muller codes is developed. Our main result shows that any second-order coset of a q-ary generalization of the first order Reed-Muller code can be partitioned into Golay complementary sets whose size depends only on a single parameter that is easily computed from a graph associated with the coset. As a first consequence, recent results of Davis and Jedwab (see Electron. Lett., vol.33, p.267-8, 1997) on Golay pairs, as well as earlier constructions of Golay (1949, 1951, 1961), Budisin (1990) and Sivaswamy (1978) are shown to arise as special cases of a unified theory for Golay complementary sets. As a second consequence, the main result directly yields bounds on the PMEPRs of codes formed from selected cosets of the generalized first order Reed-Muller code. These codes enjoy efficient encoding, good error-correcting capability, and tightly controlled PMEPR, and significantly extend the range of coding options for applications of OFDM using small numbers of carriers.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.817512","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=817512","","Reed-Muller codes","OFDM modulation;Reed-Muller codes;power control;telecommunication control;Golay codes;error correction codes","power control;OFDM modulation;peak-to-mean envelope power ratio;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;OFDM transmissions;low-cost applications;Golay complementary sequences;polyphase sequences;q-ary generalization;Golay complementary sets;graph;generalized first order Reed-Muller code;efficient encoding;error-correction","","240","","43","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is more flexible and tolerant than may be expected and it can live with social differences but not social barriers. Kaizen cannot deal with all problems and even in Japan, one size does not fit all but a flexible implementation does open up the dimension of collaboration between the workforce, the management and the technical departments. This review of Kaizen in Japan will put Kaizen in context before the presentations of some real ideas on Kaizen in the UK. It is intended to make the audience aware of some fundamental concepts of Kaizen so they can think for themselves how this new dimension of collaboration could be applied in their own company.

This paper tackles the problem of automatic external calibration of multiple cameras in an extended scene, that is, full recovery of their 3D relative positions and orientations. Because the cameras are placed far apart, brightness or proximity constraints cannot be used to match static features, so we instead apply planar geometric constraints to moving objects tracked throughout the scene. By robustly matching and fitting tracked objects to a planar model, we align the scene's ground plane across multiple views and decompose the planar alignment matrix to recover the 3D relative camera and ground plane positions. We demonstrate this technique in both a controlled lab setting where we test the effects of errors in the intrinsic camera parameters, and in an uncontrolled, outdoor setting. In the latter, we do not assume synchronized cameras and we show that enforcing geometric constraints enables us to align the tracking data in time. In spite of noise in the intrinsic camera parameters and in the image data, the system successfully transforms multiple views of the scene's ground plane to an overhead view and recovers the relative 3D camera and ground plane positions.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.868678","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=868678","","Monitoring;Streaming media;Cameras;Layout;Calibration;Brightness;Robustness;Matrix decomposition;Transmission line matrix methods;Testing","computer vision;sensor fusion;computerised monitoring;tracking;computational geometry;image matching;matrix algebra","activity monitoring;multiple video streams;common coordinate frame;multiple camera coordination;distributed cameras;automatic external calibration;3D relative position recovery;3D relative orientation recovery;brightness constraints;proximity constraints;planar geometric constraints;robust matching;robust fitting;tracked objects;planar alignment matrix;uncontrolled outdoor setting;tracking data alignment","","246","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, when such broadband patch antennas are to be excited using a probe feed, achievable bandwidth is usually limited to be less than 10%, due to the large inductance associated with the longer probe in the thick substrate layer. To overcome this problem, there are usually some compensations or modifications to be introduced in the feed arrangement or some slot loadings to be added to the radiating patch. In this article we demonstrate a new and simple broadband design of a patch antenna with a pair of wide slits. The wide slits are inserted at the boundary of a circular patch or at one of the radiating edges of a rectangular patch. The proposed broadband patch antenna can have similar wide impedance bandwidth and good radiation characteristics as those reported for a U-slotted patch antenna.

The research on the rectangular slotted-waveguide antenna has been widely conducted because it is very useful to model as the array element of a very large aperture antenna. When the ends of the waveguide are shorted by the conductor, it becomes the cavity. Therefore, the effect at the shorted ends must be taken into account. This paper presents the analysis of the linear electric probe excited rectangular cavity-backed slot antenna with finite-size ground plane. The feeding structure is simple, free from conduction and dielectric loss, high power handling and suitable for slot array applications. The integral equations for the rectangular cavity-backed slot antenna fed by a probe inside the cavity are established with the infinite ground plane, assumed outside the cavity. The method of moments with the aid of dyadic Green's function plays a vital tool in solving those equations. However, for small aperture antennas or small cavity sizes the effect at the edge must be included. The uniform geometrical theory of diffraction is a powerful method to determine the diffracted field due to the edge effect of the finite-size ground plane. The radiation pattern of the probe fed rectangular cavity-backed slot antenna with finite ground plane is compared with that from the infinite ground plane assumption. The diffraction amplitude for various distances between the slot and the edge of the ground plane is also illustrated.","","0-7803-6369-8","10.1109/APS.2000.875302","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=875302","","Probes;Slot antennas;Aperture antennas;Conductors;Dielectric losses;Integral equations;Diffraction;Antenna arrays;Moment methods;Green's function methods","probes;antenna feeds;antenna radiation patterns;slot antenna arrays;integral equations;method of moments;geometrical theory of diffraction;Green's function methods;aperture antennas;electromagnetic fields","radiation characteristics;rectangular cavity-backed slot antenna;probe fed slot antenna;finite-size ground plane;conductor;rectangular slotted-waveguide antenna;array element;aperture antenna;shorted waveguide ends;linear electric probe;feeding structure;integral equations;method of moments;dyadic Green's function;uniform geometrical theory of diffraction;UGTD;diffracted field;antenna radiation pattern;infinite ground plane;diffraction amplitude;distances","","4","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this domain we provide clear evidence that state-of-the-art commercial fraud detection systems can be substantially improved in stopping losses due to fraud by combining multiple models of fraudulent transaction shared among banks. We demonstrate that the traditional statistical metrics used to train and evaluate the performance of learning systems (ie. statistical accuracy or ROC analysis) are misleading and perhaps inappropriate for this application. Cost-based metrics are more relevant in certain domains, and defining such metrics poses significant and interesting research questions both in evaluating systems and alternative models, and in formalizing the problems to which one may wish to apply data mining technologies. This paper also demonstrates how the techniques developed for fraud detection can be generalized and applied to the important area of intrusion detection in networked information systems. We report the outcome of recent evaluations of our system applied to tcpdump network intrusion data specifically with respect to statistical accuracy. This work involved building additional components of JAM that we have come to call, MADAM ID (Mining Audit Data for Automated Models for Intrusion Detection).

In an increasing number of cases, where conventional equipment cannot solve these problems, PWM converter-based shunt- and series connected power conditioners named DSTATCOM (distribution static compensator) and DVR (dynamic voltage restorer) have been introduced. With energy storage added to the power conditioner, even more flexibility in system operation and planning is provided for utilities and industry.

The summary autocorrelation function (SACF) is further processed to obtain an enhanced SACF (ESACF). The SACF and ESACP representations are used in observing the periodicities of the signal. The model performance is demonstrated to be comparable to those of recent time-domain models that apply a multichannel analysis.

It is imperative, in all operations and manufacturing processes that downtime is avoided or minimized. If a problem does occur, the source of the problem is quickly identified and corrected. With proper knowledge and diagnostic procedures, it is normally possible to quickly pinpoint the cause of the vibration. All too often, erroneous conclusions are reached as a consequence of not understanding the root cause of the vibration. This may result in trying to fix an incorrectly diagnosed problem, spending a significant amount of time and money in the process. By utilizing the proper data collection and analysis techniques, the true source of the vibration can be discovered. This includes, but is not limited to, the following: electrical imbalance; mechanical unbalance-motor, coupling, or driven equipment; mechanical effects-looseness, rubbing, bearings, etc.; external effects-base, driven equipment, misalignment, etc.; resonance, critical speeds, reed critical, etc. Once the electrical and mechanical interactions in a motor are understood, and the influence external components have on the apparent motor vibration, identification of the offending component is usually straightforward.

The aim of the system is to support the early detection of diabetic retinopathy in a primary-care environment. For this purpose, both internal medicine. (diabetes) and ophthalmology have to be considered. The main input data are ophthalmological parameters, such as visual acuity, status of the anterior segment, status of the fundus, and previous therapies, and diabetological status; i.e., metabolic data. To reduce the huge number of parameters that have to be extracted by the ophthalmologist, image-processing methods for the automatic analysis of fundus photographs have been developed. The extraction is done by a multistage model-based approach.

There is nearly an order of magnitude difference in bandwidth between successive references to different columns within a row and different rows within a bank. This paper introduces memory access scheduling, a technique that improves the performance of a memory system by reordering memory references to exploit locality within the 3-D memory structure. Conservative reordering, in which the first ready reference in a sequence is performed, improves bandwidth by 40% for traces from five media benchmarks. Aggressive reordering, in which operations are scheduled to optimize memory bandwidth, improves bandwidth by 93% for the same set of applications. Memory access scheduling is particularly important for media processors where it enables the processor to make the most efficient use of scarce memory bandwidth.","1063-6897","1-58113-232-8","10.1145/339647.339668","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=854384","","Bandwidth;Processor scheduling;Random access memory;Delay;Streaming media;Out of order;Laboratories;Permission;Pipeline processing;Arithmetic","DRAM chips;storage management;processor scheduling","memory access scheduling;bandwidth;latency;memory system;DRAM chips","","317","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The model-based auxiliary controller can increase the closed loop small-signal bandwidth of Buck derived converters, preserving loop gain crossover frequency and stability margins over significant changes of the power stage passive elements values, the load and the line voltage. Moreover, this control scheme shows much better disturbance rejection properties, i.e., closed loop impedance and audiosusceptibility, than conventional ACC. From a control theory point of view, robust performance is achieved preserving stability. A Buck prototype has been experimentally tested with different LC output filters, line and load conditions, including discontinuous conduction mode. Measurements of the small signal frequency response of the converter have been carried out, showing the improvement achieved by the proposed control scheme.

Most use return-to-zero (RZ) format, only stable waveform in the presence of fiber Kerr nonlinearity and dispersion in an all-optical transmission line with loss compensated by periodic amplifications. The nonlinear Schrodinger equation, assisted by the split-step numerical solutions, is commonly used as the master equation to describe the information transfer in optical fibers. All these facts are the outcome of research on optical solitons in fibers in spite of the fact that the commonly used RZ format is not always called a soliton format.

No. PR00580)","","2000","","","83","88","Faces often appear very small in surveillance imagery because of the wide fields of view that are typically used and the relatively large distance between the cameras and the scene. For tasks such as face recognition, resolution enhancement techniques are therefore generally needed. Although numerous resolution enhancement algorithms have been proposed in the literature, most of them are limited by the fact that they make weak, if any, assumptions about the scene. We propose an algorithm to learn a prior on the spatial distribution of the image gradient for frontal images of faces. We proceed to show how such a prior can be incorporated into a resolution enhancement algorithm to yield 4- to 8-fold improvements in resolution (i.e., 16 to 64 times as many pixels). The additional pixels are, in effect, hallucinated.","","0-7695-0580-5","10.1109/AFGR.2000.840616","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=840616","","Image resolution;Spatial resolution;Layout;Humans;Interpolation;Face detection;Robots;Cameras;Electrical capacitance tomography;Markov random fields","face recognition;surveillance;learning (artificial intelligence);image resolution;image enhancement","surveillance imagery;face recognition;resolution enhancement;learning;spatial distribution;image gradient;frontal images;face hallucination","","308","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The RBFNN uses either a single neuron or multi-neuron architecture and the parameters are dynamically adjusted using an error surface derived from active or reactive power/voltage deviations at the UPFC injection bus. The performance of the new single neuron controller is evaluated using both single-machine infinite-bus and three-machine power systems subjected to various transient disturbances. In the case of three-machine 8-bus power system, the performance of the single neuron RBF controller is compared with a BP (backpropagation) algorithm based multi-layered ANN controller. Further it is seen that by using a multi-input multi-neuron RBF controller, instead of a single neuron one, the critical clearing time and damping performance are improved. The new RBFNN controller for UPFC exhibits a superior damping performance in comparison to the existing PI controllers. Its simple architecture reduces the computational burden thereby making it attractive for real-time implementation.","1558-0679","","10.1109/59.898104","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=898104","","Radial basis function networks;Power system transients;Control systems;Neurons;Power system dynamics;Power system stability;Damping;Reactive power;Voltage;Backpropagation","power system transient stability;radial basis function networks;control system synthesis;neurocontrollers;load flow control;control system analysis;power transmission control;flexible AC transmission systems;damping","radial basis function neural network controller;UPFC;unified power flow controller;power system transient stability performance;error surface;UPFC injection bus;transient disturbances;control design;multi-input multi-neuron RBF controller;damping performance;control simulation;FACTS","","98","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the large signal performance of these devices is not as good as one would expect from the DC performance of the device. The large signal performance of the device is improved by depositing a thin layer of SiN by PECVD. In this work silicon nitride (SiN) was deposited in a variety of conditions on AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures on sapphire substrates to study the impact of the quality of SiN on the DC, breakdown, small signal and large signal performance of the device. A maximum increase in the output power from 1.3 W/mm to 2.3 W/mm at 4 GHz, 20 V bias was observed with a SiN passivation film, grown in NH/sub 3/ rich conditions and which gave the least etch rate of 25 nm/min in buffered oxide etch (6:1). This increase in power is mainly due to the increase in DC current. This is clearly shown by plotting the RF dynamic loadline for an unpassivated and passivated device.","","0-7803-6258-6","10.1109/ISCS.2000.947182","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=947182","","Passivation;Aluminum gallium nitride;Gallium nitride;HEMTs;Silicon compounds;Etching;Substrates;Electric breakdown;Power generation;Radio frequency","aluminium compounds;gallium compounds;III-V semiconductors;wide band gap semiconductors;passivation;silicon compounds;power HEMT;semiconductor device measurement;semiconductor device breakdown;plasma CVD;etching;reaction rate constants;surface chemistry","passivation;AlGaN/GaN HEMT;device performance;high power applications;high breakdown voltage;high currents;large signal performance;DC performance;SiN;nitride;sapphire substrates;small signal;output power;SiN passivation film;etch rate;buffered oxide etch;RF dynamic loadline;DC current;4 GHz;20 V;AlGaN-GaN-SiN;NH/sub 3/;Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/","","8","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An optimum load-shedding technique is presented that can be used to improve the reliability of a local distribution system. Customer concerns regarding interruption costs are considered in the load-shedding procedure. The objective is to minimise the total system interruption cost. Cost weight factors are used to determine the load-shedding priority among feeders, and an enumeration technique is used to divide the capacity deficiency between feeders.

The authors focus their study on a coastal region of Gabon, which has a variety of land cover types common to most tropical regions. A decision tree classifier does not assume a particular probability density distribution of the input data, and is thus well adapted for SAR image classification. A total of seven features, including wavelet-based multiscale texture measures (at scales of 200, 400, and 800 m) and multiscale multitemporal amplitude data (two dates at scales 100 and 400 m), are used to discriminate the land cover classes of interest. Among these layers, the best features for separating classes are found by constructing exploratory decision trees from various feature combinations. The decision tree structure stability is then investigated by interchanging the role of the training samples for decision tree growth and testing. They show that the construction of exploratory decision trees can improve the classification results. The analysis also proves that the radar backscatter amplitude is important for separating basic land cover categories such as savannas, forests, and flooded vegetation. Texture is found to be useful for refining flooded vegetation classes. Temporal information from SAR images of two different dates is explicitly used in the decision tree structure to identify swamps and temporarily flooded vegetation.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.868888","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=868888","","Decision trees;Classification tree analysis;Vegetation mapping;Data mining;Rain;Sea measurements;Image classification;Stability;Testing;Radar imaging","geophysical techniques;vegetation mapping;forestry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;spaceborne radar;image texture;image classification;radar imaging;decision trees;geophysical signal processing","geophysical measurement technique;land surface;terrain mapping;remote sensing;image classification;decision tree;multiscale texture;image texture;JERS-1;SAR;tropical forest;vegetation mapping;radar remote sensing;synthetic aperture radar;spaceborne radar;radar imaging;decision tree classifier;Global Rain Forest Mapping;SAR mosaic;Gabon;land cover type;Africa;decision tree growth;swamp;flooded vegetation;wetlands","","127","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The uncertainty of subjective judgment is present during this selection process. Also, decision making becomes difficult when the available information is incomplete or imprecise. This kind of problem exists while selecting a project. There are also several critical factors that are involved in the selection process, including market conditions, availability of raw materials, etc. The decision mechanism is constrained by the uncertainty inherent in the determination of the relative importance of each attribute element. In this paper, me develop a system for the project selection using fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic enables us to emulate the human reasoning process and make decisions based on vague or imprecise data. Our approach is based on uncertainty reduction. The optimal alternative is formed by the relative weights of each attribute's elements combined over all the attribute membership functions. We also do a case study for the selection of software packages.

As attacks on computer systems are becoming increasingly numerous and sophisticated, there is a growing need for intrusion detection and response systems to dynamically adapt to better detect and respond to attacks. The Adaptive Hierarchical Agent-based Intrusion Detection System (AHA! IDS) provides detection adaptation by adjusting the amount of system resources devoted to the task of detecting intrusive activities. This is accomplished by dynamically invoking new combinations of lower level detection agents in response to changing circumstances and by adjusting the confidence associated with these lower-level agents. The Adaptive Agent-based Intrusion Response System (AAIRS) provides response adaptation by weighting those responses that have been successful in the past over those techniques that have not been as successful. As a result, the more successful responses are used more often than the less successful techniques. It also adapts responses based on the system's belief that intrusion detection reports are valid. Intuitively, adaptive detection and response systems will provide more robust protection than static, non-adaptive systems.","1062-922X","0-7803-6583-6","10.1109/ICSMC.2000.884341","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=884341","","Intrusion detection;Military computing;Protection;Computer security;Automatic control;Information technology;Computer science;Robustness;Computer crime;Prototypes","computer crime;adaptive systems;software agents","adaptation techniques;intrusion detection systems;intrusion response systems;computer system attacks;Adaptive Hierarchical Agent-based Intrusion Detection System;lower level detection agents;confidence;Adaptive Agent-based Intrusion Response System;protection","","30","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The pixel resolution is changed by masking or truncating the least significant bits of the pixel data, which is governed by the bit-rate control mechanism.

"Model-based despeckling and information extraction from SAR images","M. Walessa; M. Datcu","IMF, German Aerosp. Res. Establ., Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany; NA","IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","2000","38","5","2258","2269","Basic textures as they appear, especially in high resolution SAR images, are affected by multiplicative speckle noise and should be preserved by despeckling algorithms. Sharp edges between different regions and strong scatterers also must be preserved. To despeckle images, the authors use a maximum aposteriori (MAP) estimation of the cross section, choosing between different prior models. The proposed approach uses a Gauss Markov random field (GMRF) model for textured areas and allows an adaptive neighborhood system for edge preservation between uniform areas. In order to obtain the best possible texture reconstruction, an expectation maximization algorithm is used to estimate the texture parameters that provide the highest evidence. Borders between homogeneous areas are detected with a stochastic region-growing algorithm, locally determining the neighborhood system of the Gauss Markov prior. Smoothed strong scatterers are found in the ratio image of the data and the filtering result and are replaced in the image. In this way, texture, edges between homogeneous regions, and strong scatterers are well reconstructed and preserved. Additionally, the estimated model parameters can be used for further image interpretation methods.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.868883","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=868883","","Data mining;Scattering;Gaussian processes;Image edge detection;Image reconstruction;Parameter estimation;Image resolution;Speckle;Maximum a posteriori estimation;Markov random fields","geophysical techniques;geophysical signal processing;terrain mapping;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;radar imaging;image texture;speckle","model-based despeckling;speckle removal;information extraction;geophysical measurement technique;land surface;terrain mapping;radar remote sensing;SAR;image processing;radar imaging;model;synthetic aperture radar;texture;multiplicative speckle noise;despeckling algorithm;maximum aposteriori;Gauss Markov random field;adaptive neighborhood system;edge preservation;Bayes method;Bayesian inference","","137","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We use various memory models to capture and analyze the effect of various facets of cache memory architecture that guide the choice of a particular algorithm, and attempt to experimentally validate the predictions of the model. Our major conclusions are as follows: limited associativity in the mapping from main memory addresses to cache sets can significantly degrade running time; the limited number of TLB entries can easily lead to thrashing; the fanciest optimal algorithms are not competitive on real machines even at fairly large problem sizes unless cache miss penalties are quite high: low-level performance tuning ""hacks"", such as register tiling and array alignment, can significantly distort the effects of improved algorithms; and hierarchical non-linear layouts are inherently superior to the standard canonical layouts (such as row- or column-major) for this problem.","","0-7695-0550-3","10.1109/HPCA.2000.824350","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=824350","","Computer science;Electrical capacitance tomography;Electronic switching systems;Registers;Read only memory;Degradation;Multidimensional systems;Fast Fourier transforms;Educational technology;Educational programs","memory architecture;matrix algebra","matrix transposition;memory system performance;data cache;translation lookaside buffer;register tiling;array layout function;limited associativity;optimal algorithms;array alignment","","12","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With this assumption removed, little is known. Thus, in this paper, Bayes-optimal binary quantization for the detection of a shift in mean in a pair of dependent Gaussian random variables is studied. This is arguably the simplest meaningful problem one could consider. If results and rules are to be found, they ought to make themselves plain in this problem. For certain problem parametrizations (meaning the signals and correlation coefficient), optimal quantization is achievable via a single threshold applied to each observation-the same as under independence. In other cases, one observation is best ignored or is quantized with two thresholds; neither behavior is seen under independence. Further, and again in distinction from the case of independence, it is seen that in certain situations, an XOR fusion rule is optimal, and in these cases, the implied decision rule is bizarre.

Eng., Stanford Univ., CA, USA; NA","Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","","2000","9","2","226","235","Piezoresistive cantilevers are limited by two major noise sources: Johnson noise, which is independent of frequency, and conductance fluctuation noise, which has a 1/f spectrum. The 1/f fluctuations of piezoresistive cantilevers are shown to vary inversely with the total number of carriers in the piezoresistor, as formulated by Hooge in 1969. Therefore, while 1/f noise is reduced for large heavily doped cantilevers, sensitivity considerations favor thin lightly doped cantilevers. Balancing these conflicting constraints produces optima for many design and processing parameters. For a cantilever with specified spring constant and bandwidth requirements, optima are identified for the beam thickness and length, and it is shown that the legs should be between 1/3 and 2/3 of the total length with a doping depth that is 1/3 of the beam thickness. Additionally, an optimal doping concentration is identified as a function of the cantilever volume and the measurement bandwidth. Annealing reduces 1/f noise, but causes a loss in sensitivity due to dopant diffusion, and an optimal anneal is computed with a typical diffusion length 10/sup -8/ cm. The analysis, methods, and some of the conclusions of this paper are also applicable to other types of piezoresistive sensors.","1941-0158","","10.1109/84.846703","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=846703","","Process design;Design optimization;Piezoresistance;Fluctuations;Noise reduction;Bandwidth;Structural beams;Doping;Annealing;Frequency","microsensors;piezoresistive devices;1/f noise;annealing;diffusion;doping profiles","1/f noise;design optimization;process optimization;piezoresistive cantilever;spring constant;bandwidth;doping profile;annealing;dopant diffusion;integrated sensor","","144","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On the other hand, for microwave substrates with relative permittivities equal to 2.32 and 4.0, the bandwidths of quarterwave patches are less than those of halfwave patches, owing to the excitation of surface waves.

The PTTFF features true single-phase clocking, simple structure, and high performance. One PTTFF comprises only five transistors with only one controlled by the clock. Using the PTTFF together with the 14-transistor pseudo-NMOS full adder, an 8-b/spl times/8-b pipelined multiplier has been designed and implemented, employing a 0.6-/spl mu/m CMOS process.

Furthermore, it can learn to do this in a remarkably short period of time (8 or 10 hours of machine-playing time) when given only the rules of the game, a sense of direction, and a redundant and incomplete list of parameters which are thought to have something to do with the game, but whose correct signs and relative weights are unknown and unspecified.

Mag., vol.40, p.7-24, 1998) and many other authors. We examine propagation over a finitely conducting rough surface, also studied by many people including Feinberg (1944), Bass and Fuks (1979), and Barrick (see Radio Sci., vol.6, p.517-26, and vol.6., p.527-33). This paper extends the multiple scattering theories based on Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations and their smoothing approximations. The theory developed here applies to rough surfaces with small root-mean-square (RMS) heights (/spl sigma/<0.1/spl lambda/). We limit ourselves to the one-dimensional (1-D) rough surface with finite conductivity excited by a magnetic line source, which is equivalent to the Sommerfeld dipole problem in two dimensions (x-z plane). With the presence of finite roughness, the total field decomposes into the coherent field and the incoherent field. The coherent (average) field is obtained by using Dyson's equation, a fundamental integral equation based on the modified perturbation method. Once the coherent field has been obtained, we determine the Sommerfeld pole, the effective surface impedance, and the Zenneck wave for rough surfaces of small RMS heights. The coherent field is written in terms of the Fourier transform, which is equivalent to the Sommerfeld integral. Numerical examples of the attenuation function are compared to Monte Carlo simulations and are shown to contrast the flat and rough surface cases. Next, we obtain the general expression for the incoherent mutual coherence functions and scattering cross section for rough conducting surfaces.","1558-2221","","10.1109/8.898782","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=898782","","Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Surface waves;Scattering;Integral equations;Antennas and propagation;Smoothing methods;Conductivity;Perturbation methods;Surface impedance","electromagnetic wave propagation;electromagnetic wave scattering;rough surfaces;conducting bodies;integral equations;Fourier transforms;electric impedance;electromagnetic wave absorption;Monte Carlo methods;digital simulation","finitely conducting 1D rough surface;Sommerfeld wave propagation;flat finitely conducting surface;multiple scattering theories;smoothing approximations;Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations;small RMS heights;magnetic line source;Sommerfeld dipole problem;total field;coherent field;incoherent field;integral equation;modified perturbation method;Sommerfeld pole;effective surface impedance;Fourier transform;attenuation function;Monte Carlo simulations;incoherent mutual coherence functions;scattering cross section;EM wave propagation;Zenneck wave propagation","","26","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, fuzzy clustering is applied to obtain a compact initial rule-based model. Then this model is optimized by a real-coded GA subjected to constraints that maintain the semantic properties of the rules. We consider four examples from the literature: a synthetic nonlinear dynamic systems model, the iris data classification problem, the wine data classification problem, and the dynamic modeling of a diesel engine turbocharger.

The validity of the above optimal location of shunt FACTS devices is investigated, when the actual model of the line is considered. It is found that the FACTS device needs to be placed slightly off-centre to get the highest possible benefit. Both the power transfer capability and stability of the system can further be improved if the shunt FACTS device is placed at the new optimal point instead of at the midpoint of a line having some resistance.

"Validating the ISO/IEC 15504 measure of software requirements analysis process capability","K. El Emam; A. Birk","Inst. for Inf. Technol., Nat. Res. Council of Canada, Ottawa, Ont., Canada; NA","IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","","2000","26","6","541","566","ISO/IEC 15504 is an emerging international standard on software process assessment. It defines a number of software engineering processes and a scale for measuring their capability. One of the defined processes is software requirements analysis (SRA). A basic premise of the measurement scale is that higher process capability is associated with better project performance (i.e., predictive validity). The paper describes an empirical study that evaluates the predictive validity of SRA process capability. Assessments using ISO/IEC 15504 were conducted on 56 projects world-wide over a period of two years. Performance measures on each project were also collected using questionnaires, such as the ability to meet budget commitments and staff productivity. The results provide strong evidence of predictive validity for the SRA process capability measure used in ISO/IEC 15504, but only for organizations with more than 50 IT staff. Specifically, a strong relationship was found between the implementation of requirements analysis practices as defined in ISO/IEC 15504 and the productivity of software projects. For smaller organizations, evidence of predictive validity was rather weak. This can be interpreted in a number of different ways: that the measure of capability is not suitable for small organizations or that the SRA process capability has less effect on project performance for small organizations.","1939-3520","","10.1109/32.852742","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=852742","","ISO standards;IEC standards;Software measurement;Software quality;Capability maturity model;Software standards;Software engineering;Productivity;Military standards;Design engineering","ISO standards;IEC standards;software standards;software metrics;formal specification;software process improvement;software development management;program verification;human resource management","ISO/IEC 15504 measure validation;software requirements analysis process capability;international standard;software process assessment;software engineering processes;measurement scale;process capability;project performance;predictive validity;SRA process capability;performance measures;budget commitments;staff productivity;SRA process capability measure;IT staff;requirements analysis practices;software projects;small organizations","","80","","92","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The model is set up for indoor scenarios, although in principle it can be extended easily to urban environments. Deterministic ray-tracing results are used to produce the huge data sets required for the statistical evaluation of the parameters of the proposed model. The approach for the stochastic model is based on physical wave-propagation, where the channel is described by multipath components including angles of arrival at the receiver and angles of transmission at the transmitter. In each modeling step, path properties change according to the movement of the radio stations (RSs). The appearance and disappearance of multipath components is modeled by a genetic process. Especially, changing delay times of the propagation paths yield a realistic Doppler behavior of the channel. A new approach to model the directions of multipath components in three dimensions has been developed. By relating the angles of arrival (or transmission) to the direct line between transmitter and receiver, a universal modeling approach, which is independent of the actual geometry, becomes possible. The novel stochastic spatial channel model allows the simulation of complex systems including arbitrary antenna configurations and patterns. A detailed description of the overall model is presented together with some initial simulation results.","1558-0008","","10.1109/49.821698","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=821698","","Stochastic processes;Radio transmitters;Wideband;Spread spectrum communication;Ray tracing;Receivers;Genetics;Propagation delay;Solid modeling;Geometry","stochastic processes;multipath channels;radiowave propagation;land mobile radio;indoor radio;direction-of-arrival estimation;Doppler effect;delays;antenna radiation patterns;digital radio;spread spectrum communication;broadband networks","wide-band spread spectrum applications;wave-propagation modeling;stochastic spatial propagation channel model;indoor radio;urban environments;deterministic ray-tracing results;data sets;statistical evaluation;model parameters;multipath components;angles of arrival;receiver;angles of transmission;transmitter;radio station movement;genetic process;delay times;propagation paths;realistic Doppler behavior;universal modeling approach;systems simulation;antenna configurations;antenna patterns;digital wireless communications","","71","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This model has become less and less adequate as the mass of available information increases. What is required instead is a model that supports integrated and uniform access to information sources and services as well as intelligent applications for information processing on the Web. Such a model requires standard mechanisms for interchanging data and handling different data semantics. The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a step in this direction. RDF provides a data model that supports fast integration of data sources by bridging semantic differences. It is often used (and was initially designed) for representing metadata about other Web resources, such as XML files. However, representing metadata about the Web is not different from representing data generally. Thus, RDF can be used as a general framework for data exchange on the Web.","1941-0131","","10.1109/4236.895018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=895018","","Tutorial;Semantic Web;Resource description framework;Data models;Object oriented modeling;Vocabulary;Internet;Humans;Information processing;XML","data models;meta data;information resources;electronic data interchange","World Wide Web;integrated uniform information access;information sources;information services;intelligent applications;information processing;standard data interchange mechanisms;data semantics;Resource Description Framework;RDF data model;fast data source integration;semantic differences;metadata representation;XML files;data exchange","","38","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The semiconductor behavior is put into a look-up table, which replaces the advanced semiconductor models and shortens the simulation time. To extract switching and conduction losses, converter is simulated and the semiconductor power losses are estimated. Measurement results on a laboratory converter are compared with the estimated losses and a good agreement is shown.

The microaccelerometer has high device sensitivity, low noise, and low/controllable damping that are the key factors for attaining /spl mu/g and sub-/spl mu/g resolution in capacitive accelerometers. The microfabrication process produces a large proof mass by using the whole wafer thickness and a large sense capacitance by utilizing a thin sacrificial layer. The sense/feedback electrodes are formed by a deposited 2-3 /spl mu/m polysilicon film with embedded 25-35 /spl mu/m-thick vertical stiffeners. These electrodes, while thin, are made very stiff by the thick embedded stiffeners so that force rebalancing of the proof mass becomes possible. The polysilicon electrodes are patterned to create damping holes. The microaccelerometers are batch-fabricated, packaged, and tested successfully. A device with a 2-mm/spl times/1-mm proof mass and a full bridge support has a measured sensitivity of 2 pF/g. The measured sensitivity of a 1-mm/spl times/1-mm accelerometer with a cantilever support is 19.4 pF/g. The calculated noise floor of these devices at atmosphere are 0.23 /spl mu/g//spl radic/Hz and 0.16 /spl mu/g//spl radic/Hz, respectively.","1941-0158","","10.1109/84.896777","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896777","","Accelerometers;Electrodes;Damping;Atmospheric measurements;Fabrication;Capacitance;Feedback;Packaging;Testing;Bridge circuits","accelerometers;elemental semiconductors;silicon;micromachining;semiconductor device noise;capacitive sensors;microsensors","micro-g accelerometer;bulk micromachining;surface micromachining;device sensitivity;noise;controllable damping;capacitive accelerometers;wafer thickness;sense capacitance;sacrificial layer;sense/feedback electrodes;vertical stiffeners;force rebalancing;damping holes;full bridge support;cantilever support;2 to 3 micron;25 to 35 micron;Si","","95","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The controller (disturbance observer) is designed such that the system sensitivity function is made to match a chosen target sensitivity function by numerical optimization. One advantage of the proposed design method is that the tradeoff between command following, disturbance suppression, and measurement noise rejection is made transparent in the process of the control system design. This allows the system designer to bypass the effort of obtaining a highly accurate system model. Another aim of this research, relative to previous works, is to study how the design specifications can be best structured in the digital filter (a main component of the disturbance observer) for easy implementation. The robust feedback controller, designed in the velocity loop, is used in conjunction with a feedback controller located in the position loop and a feedforward controller acting on the desired output to construct a control structure for high-speed/high-accuracy motion control.

"Robust control with decoupling performance for steering and traction of 4WS vehicles under velocity-varying motion","Yingmin Jia","Seventh Res. Div., Beijing Univ. of Aeronaut. & Astronaut., China","IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","","2000","8","3","554","569","This paper mainly studies robust steering and traction of four-wheel steering (4WS) vehicles with varying velocity, mass, moment of inertia, and road-tire interaction. To this end, a nonlinear vehicle model is developed which both takes the acceleration and braking effects on the system dynamics into account and avoids using the complicated side force relation. Based on this model, a nonlinear input-output decoupling controller is first designed, by which the vehicle system can be decoupled into three two-order subsystems, i.e., the velocity subsystem controlled by the longitudinal acceleration/braking force, the lateral motion subsystem by the front steering angle, and the yaw motion subsystem by the rear steering angle, so that the load of the driver can be relieved. Especially, a new decoupling condition is derived. It is proved that a vehicle with the front wheel braking or rear wheel drive can always be decoupled provided it does not accelerate so fast or brake so hard that its front or rear wheels are lifted from the ground. Furthermore, in order to reduce the effects of the vehicle parameter variations on steering performance, a robust control scheme is proposed. The corresponding controller and observer gains can be obtained by solving two new Riccati algebraic equations. Meanwhile, by properly choosing the form of the observer, the robust controller does not destroy the decoupling structure of the longitudinal and yaw motions. The numerical simulation shows that the robust control with decoupling performance can improve safety and comfort of the vehicle driving.","1558-0865","","10.1109/87.845885","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=845885","","Robust control;Acceleration;Motion control;Vehicle driving;Wheels;Road vehicles;Force control;Velocity control;Nonlinear control systems;Riccati equations","road vehicles;robust control;nonlinear control systems","robust control;decoupling performance;4WS vehicle steering;4WS vehicle traction;velocity-varying motion;four-wheel steering vehicles;nonlinear vehicle model;acceleration effects;braking effects;nonlinear input-output decoupling controller;I/O decoupling controller design;velocity subsystem;longitudinal acceleration/braking force;front steering angle;yaw motion subsystem;rear steering angle;front wheel braking;rear wheel drive;Riccati algebraic equations","","157","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Design criteria are the ability of the rotor to withstand high speeds, ability to operate in vacuum, negligible zero-torque spinning losses, high reliability, high efficiency, and low manufacturing cost. The rotor of the synchronous reluctance machine consists of bonded sections of ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic steels. Finite-element code, incorporating rotor rotation, has been developed in MATLAB that calculates steady-state eddy currents (and losses) in the rotor. A stator iron and stator winding have been designed to minimize rotor losses, and two such prototype machines have been fabricated. Experimental results show an efficiency of 91% at a 10 kW 10000 r/min operating point, and rotor losses less than 0.5% of input power.","1939-9367","","10.1109/28.833771","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=833771","","Reluctance machines;Refining;Spinning;Manufacturing;Costs;Bonding;Steel;Finite element methods;MATLAB;Steady-state","reluctance machines;rotors;eddy current losses;reliability;finite element analysis;machine theory;stators","high-speed synchronous reluctance machine;minimized rotor losses;minimized eddy-current losses;zero-torque spinning losses;high reliability;high efficiency;low manufacturing cost;bonded sections;nonmagnetic steels;ferromagnetic steels;finite-element code;rotor rotation;MATLAB;steady-state eddy currents;stator iron;stator winding;91 percent;10 kW","","64","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Image field categorization and edge/corner detection from gradient covariance","S. Ando","Dept. of Math. Eng. & Inf.

Ridges and peaks correspond to 1D and 2D extrema in it. All of them can be characterized by the distribution of gradients, particularly by the dimensionality of it. The approach to image field categorization here is to construct a covariance matrix of the gradient vector in each small window and apply the canonical correlation analysis to it. Schwarz's inequality on the matrix determinant and the related differential equation is the key to this analysis. We obtain two operators P/sub EG/ and Q/sub EG/ to categorize the image field into a unidirectionally varying region (UNIVAR), an omidirectionally varying region (OMNIVAR), and a nonvarying region. We investigate the conditions under which their absolute maximum response, i.e. P/sub EG/=1 and Q/sub EG/=1, occurs in the small window and show that they are, respectively, the desired 1D and 2D discontinuities/extrema and OMNIVAR, is in many cases, a 1D pattern in polar coordinates. This leads to an algorithm to obtain further classification and accurate localization of them into edges, ridges, peaks, corners, and vertices through detailed analysis in the informative (varying) axis of them. We examined and compared the performance of the operators and the localization algorithm on various types of images and various noise levels. The results indicate that the proposed method is superior with respect to stability, localization, and resolution.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.825756","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=825756","","Image edge detection;Surface fitting;Filters;Layout;Covariance matrix;Feature extraction;Computer vision;Detectors;Face detection;Image analysis","feature extraction;covariance matrices;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Gaussian noise;filtering theory","image field categorization;corner detection;edge detection;gradient covariance;2D discontinuities;1D discontinuities;intensity surface;2D extrema;1D extrema;canonical correlation analysis;Schwarz's inequality;matrix determinant;P/sub EG/ operator;Q/sub EG/ operator;unidirectionally varying region;omidirectionally varying region;nonvarying region;absolute maximum response;1D pattern;polar coordinates;localization;resolution","","65","","45","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To capture its effect in mechanical systems, a bristle-based dynamical model, known as the LuGre model, was proposed in the literature. It is difficult to assess whether this (or any other) mathematical model constitutes a bona fide friction model. It should, however, reflect the dissipative nature of friction, which mathematically translates into the requirement of defining a passive operator from velocity to friction force. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for this property to hold for the LuGre model. The conditions are expressed in terms of a simple algebraic inequality involving the parameters of the model.

The rationale behind the filtering strategy and the level of averaging needed is explained in terms of the observed multitemporal behavior of forest and nonforest areas, much of this analysis is generic and applicable to a wide range of situation in which significant information is carried by multitemporal features of the data. The choice of decision rules is based on the forest observations, with the added requirement for robustness. The performance of a classifier based only on change is assessed on a range of test sites in the UK, Finland, and Poland. Error sources in this classifier are identified, and the possibility of improving performance by including radiometric information in the mapping strategy is discussed.

A bottom-up analysis of this graph allows one to compute reliability functions which evaluate the robustness of the observability property with respect to sensor failures.

To achieve this, the feed drive system is modeled, using neuro-fuzzy techniques, to provide the framework for estimating the feed cutting force based on the feed motor current measured. Functional dependence of the feed cutting force on tool wear and cutting parameters are then expressed in the form of a difference equation relating variation in the feed cutting force to tool wear rate. The computerized system automatically compares successive feed cutting force estimates and determines the onset of accelerated tool wear in order to issue a request for tool replacement.

Multi-bit /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ modulators are the preferred choice for converters achieving high performance, especially in DACs. Compared with continuous-time, current mode DACs, a SC architecture provides significantly higher clock-jitter tolerance and eliminates inter-symbol interference. The performance of conventional 1 b SC DACs is limited by severe post-filtering needs and constrained signal swings due to poor modulator stability. The relaxed filtering needs and better modulator stability of a multi-bit approach make the multi-bit DAC an attractive alternative. However, nonlinearity caused by sampling element mismatch must be overcome to produce a low-distortion device. Second-order dynamic element matching (DEM) is used to address the nonlinearity issue.

There are five control signals in the input of the look-up table. These control signals are used to control the power flow of the adopted rectifier, compensate the capacitor voltages for the balance problem, draw a sinusoidal line current with nearly unity power factor, and generate a three-level PWM pattern on the AC side of adopted rectifier. The advantages of using three-level PWM scheme compared with two-level PWM scheme are using low voltage stress of power switches, decreasing input current harmonics, and reducing the conduction losses.

From training data of a given gesture, we first learn the spatial information and then group the data into segments that are automatically aligned temporally. The temporal information is further integrated to build a finite state machine (FSM) recognizer. Each gesture has a FSM corresponding to it.

Apparent power (kVA) derating of single-phase transformers operating with nonsinusoidal currents and voltages is measured by adjusting the total losses to the rated losses at rated temperature, whereby hot-spot considerations are ignored. Computed results of derating using the harmonic loss factor (F/sub HL/), eddy-current loss coefficient P/sub EC-Rnonlinear/ and iron-core losses match well with measured data. However, the real power derating of transformer is much greater than apparent power derating for a given THD/sub i/ value, and it is independent of the frequency spectra of the harmonics.

However, being a linear model, the linear MPA EEG model cannot perfectly describe the spontaneous EEG that displays nonlinear phenomena. Here, the nonlinear Markov process amplitude (nonlinear MPA) EEG model that includes nonlinear components is introduced. The consistent consideration of the nonlinear features of the EEG investigated by N. Wiener (1966) and P.L. Nunez (1995) can be seen from the nonlinear MPA EEG model. The similarity in the time domain and the goodness of fitting in the frequency domain with respect to the ongoing EEG are shown. As a result, the EEG power spectrum can be decomposed into the spontaneous components and the nonlinearly coupled components by use of the nonlinear MPA EEG model, which is useful for a better understanding the mechanism of the EEG generation.","1558-2531","","10.1109/10.867917","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=867917","","Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Couplings;Markov processes;Frequency domain analysis;Control engineering;Rhythm;Neuroscience;Displays;Power generation","electroencephalography;Markov processes;physiological models;spectral analysis;medical signal processing","nonlinear Markov process amplitude EEG model;nonlinear coupling interaction;spontaneous EEG;EEG features representation;linear model;time domain;goodness of fitting;frequency domain;electrodiagnostics;ongoing EEG;EEG power spectrum;spontaneous components;nonlinearly coupled components","Biomedical Engineering;Electroencephalography;Humans;Markov Chains;Models, Neurological;Nonlinear Dynamics","13","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We claim that the problem of dialog design can be formalized as an optimization problem with an objective function reflecting different dialog dimensions relevant for a given application. We also show that any dialog system can be formally described as a sequential decision process in terms of its state space, action set, and strategy. With additional assumptions about the state transition probabilities and cost assignment, a dialog system can be mapped to a stochastic model known as Markov decision process (MDP). A variety of data driven algorithms for finding the optimal strategy (i.e., the one that optimizes the criterion) is available within the MDP framework, based on reinforcement learning. For an effective use of the available training data we propose a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning: the supervised learning is used to estimate a model of the user, i.e., the MDP parameters that quantify the user's behavior. Then a reinforcement learning algorithm is used to estimate the optimal strategy while the system interacts with the simulated user. This approach is tested for learning the strategy in an air travel information system (ATIS) task. The experimental results we present in this paper show that it is indeed possible to find a simple criterion, a state space representation, and a simulated user parameterization in order to automatically learn a relatively complex dialog behavior, similar to one that was heuristically designed by several research groups.","1558-2353","","10.1109/89.817450","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=817450","","Stochastic processes;Man machine systems;State-space methods;Design optimization;Costs;Stochastic systems;Training data;Supervised learning;System testing;Information systems","interactive systems;optimisation;probability;Markov processes;learning (artificial intelligence);travel industry;information systems;decision theory;speech recognition;natural language interfaces","stochastic model;human-machine interaction;dialog strategies;quantitative model;dialog systems;optimization problem;sequential decision process;state transition probabilities;cost assignment;Markov decision process;optimal strategy;reinforcement learning;supervised learning;air travel information system;experiment;state space representation","","207","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a solution to the problem of determining the combined influences of several diseases on a single test result from specificity and sensitivity data for individual diseases.

By eliminating these sources of overhead and focusing on basic data management services for control systems (data sharing, serializable transactions, and multiprocessor support), the MDARTS prototype provides hard real time transaction times approximately three orders of magnitude faster than prior real time database systems. MDARTS ensures bounded locking delay by disabling preemption when a transaction is waiting for a lock, and hence, allows for the estimation of worst case transaction execution times. Another contribution of MDARTS is that it supports explicit declarations of real time requirements and semantic constraints within application code. The MDARTS library examines these declarations at application initialization time and attempts to construct objects that are compatible with the requirements. Besides local shared memory transactions with hard real time response time guarantees, MDARTS also supports remote transactions that use remote procedure calls for data access with less stringent timing constraints. The MDARTS prototype is implemented in C++ and it runs on VME based multiprocessors and Sun workstations.","1558-2191","","10.1109/69.868911","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=868911","","Real time systems;Database systems;Object oriented databases;Computer architecture;Prototypes;Delay estimation;Application software;Transaction databases;Control systems;Libraries","Bibliographies;Object-oriented databases;Real-time systems;Transaction processing;Shared memory systems;Remote procedure calls;Multiprocessing systems","MDARTS;multiprocessor database architecture;hard real time systems;complex real time systems;concurrent data access;well defined interfaces;software modules;conventional database systems;prior real time database systems;predictability;hard real time applications;object oriented database system;Multiprocessor Database Architecture for Real Time Systems;client server overhead;transaction execution;application tasks;basic data management services;control systems;data sharing;serializable transactions;multiprocessor support;hard real time transaction times;bounded locking delay;worst case transaction execution times;explicit declarations;real time requirements;semantic constraints;application code;MDARTS library;application initialization;local shared memory transactions;hard real time response time guarantees;remote transactions;remote procedure calls;data access;timing constraints;C++;VME based multiprocessors;Sun workstations","","4","","51","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, the low-power GPS signal is susceptible to interference. This paper presents a novel VLSI architecture that removes narrow-band signals from the wide-bandwidth GPS spectrum. The interference suppression technique employed is frequency-domain excision. The single-chip frequency-domain excisor transforms the received signal (GPS signal+noise+interference) to the frequency domain, computes signal statistics to determine an excision threshold, removes all spectral energy exceeding that threshold, and restores the remaining signal (GPS signal+noise) to the temporal domain. The heart of this VLSI implementation is an on-chip 256-point fast Fourier transform processor that operates at 40 million complex samples per second. It processes 12-bit (for each I and Q) sampled complex data. The 1.57 million-transistor chip was fabricated in 0.5-/spl mu/m CMOS triple metal technology and is fully functional.","1558-173X","","10.1109/4.826823","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=826823","","Narrowband;Global Positioning System;Very large scale integration;CMOS technology;Gears;Navigation;Computer architecture;Interference suppression;Frequency domain analysis;Statistics","Global Positioning System;adaptive filters;frequency-domain analysis;interference suppression;fast Fourier transforms;VLSI;application specific integrated circuits","single-chip narrow-band frequency-domain excisor;Global Positioning System;navigation;low-power GPS signal;VLSI architecture;interference suppression technique;signal statistics;temporal domain;VLSI implementation;fast Fourier transform processor;CMOS triple metal technology;0.5 micron","","79","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The work presented in this paper avoids the need of equivalent circuits by integrating a numerical simulator for Schottky diodes into a circuit simulator. The good agreement between the calculated and published experimental data for the output power and conversion efficiency originates from the accurate physical model. The limiting effects of multiplier performance such as breakdown, forward conduction, or saturation velocity are discussed in view of the optimum circuit conditions for multiplier operation including bias point, input power, and loads at different harmonics.

In the early days, developing CE software presented relatively minor challenges, but in the past several years three significant problems have arisen: size and complexity of the software in individual products; the increasing diversity of products and their software; and the need for decreased development time. The question of handling diversity and complexity in embedded software at an increasing production speed becomes an urgent one. The authors present their belief that the answer lies not in hiring more software engineers. They are not readily available, and even if they were, experience shows that larger projects induce larger lead times and often result in greater complexity. Instead, they believe that the answer lies in the use and reuse of software components that work within an explicit software architecture. The Koala model, a component-oriented approach detailed in this article, is their way of handling the diversity of software in consumer electronics. Used for embedded software in TV sets, it allows late binding of reusable components with no additional overhead.","1558-0814","","10.1109/2.825699","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=825699","","Consumer electronics;Embedded software;Hardware;Application software;Software libraries;Object oriented modeling;Skeleton;Design engineering;Java;Moore's Law","consumer electronics;embedded systems;software reusability;software architecture;electronic engineering computing","Koala component model;consumer electronics software;embedded software;software component reuse;explicit software architecture;TV sets","","372","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Lombard effect speech, and noisy actual stressed speech from the SUSAS database which is available on a CD-ROM through the NATO IST/TG-01 research group and LDC. In addition, this study investigates the immunity of the linear prediction power spectrum and fast Fourier transform power spectrum to the presence of stress. Our results show that unlike fast Fourier transform's (FFT) immunity to noise, the linear prediction power spectrum is more immune than FFT to stress as well as to a combination of a noisy and stressful environment. Finally, the effect of various parameter processing such as fixed versus variable preemphasis, liftering, and fixed versus cepstral mean normalization are studied. Two alternative frequency partitioning methods are proposed and compared with traditional mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) features for stressed speech recognition. It is shown that the alternate filterbank frequency partitions are more effective for recognition of speech under both simulated and actual stressed conditions.","1558-2353","","10.1109/89.848224","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=848224","","Speech recognition;Stress;Working environment noise;Cepstral analysis;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Degradation;Speech analysis;Robustness;Spatial databases;CD-ROMs","speech recognition;feature extraction;prediction theory;fast Fourier transforms;filtering theory;channel bank filters;cepstral analysis","speech recognition algorithms;performance;adverse environments;emotion;CD-ROM;stressed speech recognition;robust features;speaking conditions;simulated angry speech;loud speech;Lombard effect speech;noisy stressed speech;NATO IST/TG-01 research group;LDC;linear prediction power spectrum;fast Fourier transform power spectrum;FFT;noise immunity;parameter processing;variable preemphasis;fixed preemphasis;liftering;fixed mean normalization;cepstral mean normalization;frequency partitioning methods;mel-frequency cepstral coefficients;filterbank frequency partitions","","136","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We offer an overview of the enabling technologies and extend the treatment to the network application of these converters. Attention is given to semiconductor optical amplifiers and their use in wavelength converters. Converters based on four-wave mixing as well as those based on nonlinear optical loop mirrors are evaluated, paying special attention to signal integrity and architectural as well as performance issues.

Using these phasor measurements as input conditions for computing a relatively good, simplified dynamic model can yield accurate and real-time transient stability prediction in a central location equipped with high-speed computers. In an effort to reduce the computing time for integrating the differential/algebraic equation (DAE) model of postfault power system dynamics for prediction use, this paper presents a faster implicitly decoupled PQ integration technique. Two piecewise dynamic equivalents are also proposed, i.e., piecewise constant current load equivalent and piecewise constant transfer admittance equivalent. These equivalents can eliminate the algebraic equations by approximating the load flow solution piecewisely such that only internal generator buses are preserved, while approximately retaining the characteristics of the nonlinear loads.

The EEG data are first decomposed into signal and noise subspaces using a principal component analysis (PCA) decomposition. This partitioning allows us to easily discard the noise subspace, which has two primary benefits: the remaining signal is less noisy, and it has lower dimensionality. After PCA, we apply independent component analysis (ICA) on the signal subspace. The ICA algorithm separates multichannel data into activation maps due to temporally independent stationary sources. For each activation map we perform an EEG source localization procedure, looking only for a single dipole per map. By localizing multiple dipoles independently, we substantially reduce our search complexity and increase the likelihood of efficiently converging on the correct solution.","1937-4186","","10.1109/51.844386","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=844386","","Independent component analysis;Electroencephalography;Scalp;Neurons;Brain;Voltage;Current;Principal component analysis;Head;Electromagnetic measurements","electroencephalography;medical signal processing;principal component analysis;inverse problems;time series;signal sources","EEG source localization;independent component analysis;spatiotemporal method;EEG time series;configuration space;noise subspace;signal subspace;principal component analysis decomposition;partitioning;ICA algorithm;multichannel data;activation maps;search complexity","Algorithms;Brain;Brain;Brain Mapping;Computer Simulation;Electroencephalography;Humans","86","","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

By applying a filtering factor to the sensor model, uncertainties in sonar responses can be successfully reduced. In this paper, we introduce a novel way of using the conflict value in Dempster-Shafer evidence theory in the sensor model.

This relation typically exhibits significant nonlinearities and hysteresis because of inherent properties of magnetostrictive materials. The characterization considered here is based on the Jiles-Atherton mean field model for ferromagnetic hysteresis in combination with a quadratic moment rotation model for magnetostriction. As demonstrated by comparison with experimental data, the magnetization model very adequately quantifies both major and minor loops under various operating conditions. The combined model can then be used to accurately characterize output strains at moderate drive levels. The advantages of this model lie in the small number (six) of required parameters and its flexibility under a variety of operating conditions.","1941-0069","","10.1109/20.825804","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=825804","","Magnetostriction;Transducers;Magnetic materials;Magnetic hysteresis;Magnetic field induced strain;Magnetic properties;Magnetic cores;Aerodynamics;Strain control;Magnetic field measurement","magnetostrictive devices;transducers;magnetic hysteresis;ferromagnetism;magnetic moments","energy-based hysteresis model;magnetostrictive transducers;modeling;input current;strains;nonlinearities;Jiles-Atherton mean field model;ferromagnetic hysteresis;quadratic moment rotation model;magnetostriction;magnetization model;major loops;minor loops","","132","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Fuzzy integrals are defined with respect to fuzzy measures, whose key property is monotonicity with respect to set inclusion. This property is far weaker than the usual additivity property of probability measures. As a result of the new formulation, the statistical independence assumption of the classical hidden Markov models is relaxed. Two attractive properties of this generalization are: the generalized hidden Markov model reduces to the classical hidden Markov model if we used the Choquet fuzzy integral and probability measures; and the establishment of a relation between the generalized hidden Markov model and the classical nonstationary hidden Markov model in which the transitional parameters vary with time.","1941-0034","","10.1109/91.824772","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=824772","","Hidden Markov models;Fuzzy sets;Probability;Handwriting recognition;Biological system modeling;Statistical analysis;Environmental factors;Speech;Application software;Computer science","hidden Markov models;fuzzy set theory;probability;handwriting recognition","hidden Markov models;generalization;fuzzy measures;fuzzy integrals;probability;additivity property;handwriting recognition","","74","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The sine-wave amplitudes are generated by sampling a linear combination of frequency domain basis functions. The basis function gains are determined such that the mel-frequency binned spectrum of the reconstructed speech is similar to the mel-frequency binned spectrum, obtained from the original MFCC vector by IDCT and antilog operations.

It is well known that a second-order linear time-varying system can be used to model higher order linear time invariant systems piece-wise. Therefore, it is necessary to do deep investigation for the stability and robustness analysis and the design of advanced tracking controllers for second-order linear time-varying systems. It is shown that the design of sliding mode control system is divided into two steps. A linear sliding mode controller is designed first to speed up the error convergence when the error is greater than one. A terminal sliding mode controller is then designed to guarantee that the error can converge to zero in a finite time when the error is around the system origin. In order to have a smooth switching from the linear sliding mode control to the terminal sliding mode control, a fuzzy logic technique is used to connect two sliding mode surfaces. The stability of the proposed fuzzy sliding mode controller is analyzed, and the convergence and robustness properties are demonstrated in a simulation example with a second-order system.","","0-7803-5995-X","10.1109/WCICA.2000.862759","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=862759","","Fuzzy control;Sliding mode control;Error correction;Robust stability;Time varying systems;Convergence;Fuzzy systems;Stability analysis;Robust control;Control systems","variable structure systems;fuzzy control;time-varying systems;convergence;linear systems;reduced order systems;piecewise linear techniques;control system analysis;robust control;control system synthesis;tracking","fuzzy sliding mode control scheme;second-order linear time-varying systems;error convergence;error dynamics;high-order linear time-invariant system piecewise modelling;LTI system modelling;stability;robustness analysis;advanced tracking controllers;sliding mode control system design;linear sliding mode controller;terminal sliding mode controller;smooth switching;linear sliding mode control;terminal sliding mode control;fuzzy logic technique","","2","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed PARAFAC receiver capitalizes on code, spatial, and temporal diversity-combining, thereby supporting small sample sizes, more users than sensors, and/or less spreading than users. Interestingly, PARAFAC does not require knowledge of spreading codes, the specifics of multipath (interchip interference), DOA-calibration information, finite alphabet/constant modulus, or statistical independence/whiteness to recover the information-bearing signals. Instead, PARAFAC relies on a fundamental result regarding the uniqueness of low-rank three-way array decomposition due to Kruskal (1977, 1988) (and generalized herein to the complex-valued case) that guarantees identifiability of all relevant signals and propagation parameters.

These filters smear the transmitted waveform, and cause inter-symbol interference (ISI) between the blocks, forcing a further extension to the cyclic prefix. The tighter the filtering, the smaller the frequency bandwidth (guard-band) needed between adjacent channel users and the longer the prefix extension. Equations are developed that relate the prefix extension to the guard-band given the required subchannel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Numerical evaluation is then used to show the trade off between time domain and frequency domain capacity loss. There is an optimum guard-band loss, that will minimize the total (time+frequency) capacity loss. The total loss reduces as the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) size N increases and the required SNR reduces. The capacity loss exceeds 40% when N=32 and SNR is 33 dB (needed for 8DPSK with an symbol error rate (SER) of 3% and a margin of 10 dB). Some of the loss can be reduced by using better filters (Chebyshev II), but the general trend of the results imply that schemes with a low number of subchannels (N<16) will not work well with high order modulations.","1939-9359","","10.1109/25.892590","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=892590","","Filtering;OFDM;Filters;Frequency division multiplexing;Radio frequency;Intersymbol interference;Bandwidth;Equations;Signal to noise ratio;Frequency domain analysis","OFDM modulation;radiofrequency interference;intersymbol interference;digital filters;AWGN channels","filtering;performance;OFDM systems;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;radio frequencies;transmitted waveform;intersymbol interference;ISI;cyclic prefix;frequency bandwidth;guard-band;adjacent channel users;prefix extension;subchannel signal-to-noise ratio;time domain capacity loss;frequency domain capacity loss;capacity loss;inverse fast Fourier transform;IFFT;Chebyshev II;subchannels","","79","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method is based on the use of a short-current pulse of the PV array to determine an optimum operating current for the maximum output power and completely differs from conventional hill-climbing based methods. In the proposed system, the optimum operating current is instantaneously determined by taking a product of the short-current pulse amplitude and a parameter k because the optimum operating current is exactly proportional to the short current under various conditions of illuminance and temperature. Also, the system offers an identification function of k by means of fast power-vs.-current curve scanning, which makes the short-current pulse based MPPT adaptive to disturbances such as shades partially covering the PV panels. The above adaptive MPPT algorithm has been adopted to a current-controlled boost chopper and a multiple power converter system composed by PV-chopper modules. Various operating characteristics have been examined, and excellent MPPT performance has been confirmed through the experimental tests.","","0-7803-6606-9","10.1109/ISIE.2000.930504","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=930504","","Photovoltaic systems;Solar power generation;Power generation;Testing;Voltage;Temperature sensors;Delay;Databases;Power engineering and energy;Choppers","photovoltaic power systems;power system control;control system synthesis;optimal control;power system measurement;solar cell arrays;choppers (circuits);power convertors;adaptive control","photovoltaic power generation system;adaptive maximum-power-point tracking;short-current pulse;PV array;maximum output power;optimum operating current;control design;illuminance;temperature;disturbances;PV panels;PV power systems;current-controlled boost chopper;multiple power converter system;operating characteristics;control performance","","48","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Face detection is carried out by constructing several detectors, each of them in charge of one specific view. The symmetrical property of face images is employed to simplify the complexity of the modelling. The estimation of head pose, which is achieved by using the support vector regression technique, provides crucial information for choosing the appropriate face detector. This helps to improve the accuracy and reduce the computation in multi-view face detection compared to other methods. For video sequences, further computational reduction can be achieved by using a pose change smoothing strategy. When face detectors find a face in frontal view, a support vector machine-based multi-class classifier is activated for face recognition. All the above issues are integrated under a support vector machine framework. Test results on four video sequences are presented, among them the detection rate is above 95%, recognition accuracy is above 90%, average pose estimation error is around 10/spl deg/, and the full detection and recognition speed is up to 4 frames/second on a Pentium II 300 PC.","","0-7695-0580-5","10.1109/AFGR.2000.840650","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=840650","","Face detection;Detectors;Face recognition;Video sequences;Magnetic heads;Smoothing methods;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Testing;Estimation error","face recognition;image classification;feature extraction;image sequences;statistical analysis","support vector regression;classification;multi-view face detection;face recognition;support vector machine;symmetrical property;head pose estimation;video sequences;pose change smoothing;multi-class classifier;Pentium II 300 PC","","51","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Extreme programming is a methodology for software system development that focuses on high customer integration, extensive testing, code-centered development and documentation, refactoring and paired programming. Typically, the project course is managed using the standard waterfall or V-shaped development models with a faculty advisor acting as a customer for the project. In this project extreme programming has been used instead. Extreme programming is based on a sequence of development practices, including pair programming, very accurate configuration management, strong customer interaction based on ""system stories"", detailed testing. In this project, paired programmers are used for the duration of a release and then the pairs rotate. The distributed programming environment is handled using the JCVS suite of configuration management tools. Every 3-4 weeks, a new fully functional release is delivered and reviewed by the customer. The specifications for each release are captured incrementally using use case scenarios. Only the essential requirements for the current iteration are implemented. The JUnit test suite is also used to test each of the Java classes on an ongoing basis. The test suite verifies all aspects of the software at each build; this is necessary when refactoring components. Requirements capture, design and implementation of the deliverables are performed incrementally and result in quicker development times and reduced defects. Refactoring is applied wherever possible to simplify the code. Documentation is applied using the standard JavaDoc utility and is kept to a minimum. Finally, customer feedback is immediately incorporated into future iterations of the design process.","0840-7789","0-7803-5957-7","10.1109/CCECE.2000.849579","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=849579","","Software testing;Documentation;Java;Software systems;System testing;Project management;Standards development;Programming profession;Programming environments;Environmental management","Distributed programming;Java;Configuration management;Program testing;Formal specification","university team design experience;extreme programming approach;team design project course;software system development;high customer integration;testing;code-centered development;refactoring;paired programming;standard waterfall;V-shaped development models;faculty advisor;development practices;pair programming;configuration management;strong customer interaction;system stories;distributed programming environment;JCVS suite;configuration management tools;fully functional release;use case scenarios;JUnit test suite;Java classes;requirements capture;development times;standard JavaDoc utility;customer feedback;design process","","7","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The conventional methods used for position sensing in SRM drives have the disadvantages of additional cost, additional electrical connections, mechanical alignment problem, less suitability to space restricted applications and the significant disadvantage of being an inherent source of unreliability. This motivated the development of several sensorless techniques, some of which are successfully implemented and are commercially available. Ideally, it is desirable to have a sensorless scheme, which uses only terminal measurements and does not require additional hardware: while maintaining a reliable operation over the entire speed and torque range with high resolution and accuracy.

All the procedures must be done in real time. This paper proposes a method for augmented reality with a stereo vision sensor and a video see-through head-mounted display (HMD). It can synchronize the display timing between the virtual and real worlds so that the alignment error is reduced. The method calculates camera parameters from three markers in image sequences captured by a pair of stereo cameras mounted on the HMD. In addition, it estimates the real-world depth from a pair of stereo images in order to generate a composed image maintaining consistent occlusions between real and virtual objects.

The proposed new algorithm detects the islanding by distinguishing the differences in the system characteristic between those experienced when the DG unit is running in parallel with the utility supply and when it is operating independently. In the parallel operation mode, due to the high capacity of the utility system, any change in the voltage magnitude of DG unit produces smaller change in the voltage at the inter-tie point than that in islanding operation mode, and larger change in the injecting reactive power at the inter-tie point than that in islanding operation mode. That is, when the small change on the voltage magnitude of DG unit is made within 0.01 per unit, if the voltage at the inter-tie point changes as much as the small change and the injecting reactive power at the inter-tie point has almost no change, that operation state can be decided to be islanding operation mode.

These faults correspond to a loss of actuator effectiveness or fault sensor measurements. After describing these faults, a fault estimation and compensation method was proposed. In addition to providing information to operators concerning the system operating conditions, the fault diagnosis module is especially important in fault-tolerant control systems where one needs to know exactly which element is faulty to react safely. The method's abilities to compensate for such faults are illustrated by applying it to a winding machine, which represents a subsystem of many industrial systems. The results show that once the fault is detected and isolated, it is easy to reduce its effect on the system, and process control is resumed with degraded performances close to nominal ones. Thus, stopping the system immediately can be avoided. However, the limits of this method are reached when there is the complete loss of an actuator. In this case, only a hardware redundancy is effective and could ensure performance reliability. The method proposed here assumes the availability of the state variables for measurement.","1941-000X","","10.1109/37.823226","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=823226","","Fault tolerant systems;Control systems;Automatic control;Actuators;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems;Loss measurement;Fault diagnosis;Machine windings;Electrical equipment industry","fault tolerance;compensation;industrial control","winding machine;fault-tolerant control;dynamic systems;sensor faults;actuator faults;highly automated systems;fault estimation;fault compensation;industrial systems;degraded performances;hardware redundancy;performance reliability","","196","","56","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The other is an active feedback circuit (AFB) to prevent permanent failure of HBT's in the output power stage even under severe conditions of oversupply voltage and strongly mismatching load. Experimental results revealed that the proposed feedback circuit, which works as a voltage limiter, can protect the output stage HBT's from an excessive collector voltage swing even when the amplifier is operated under a condition of a 5-V oversupply voltage and a 10:1 voltage standing-wave ratio (VSWR) mismatching load. Under a normal condition of 3.2 V and a 50-/spl Omega/ matching load, the IC is capable of delivering an output power of 34.5 dBm and a power-added efficiency (PaE) of 52% in a GSM900 mode, and a 32-dBm output power and a 32% PAE in a DCS1800 mode.","1558-173X","","10.1109/4.859499","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=859499","","Dual band;Gallium arsenide;Heterojunction bipolar transistors;MMICs;Switches;Voltage;Power amplifiers;Switching circuits;Power generation;Feedback circuits","low-power electronics;MMIC power amplifiers;bipolar MMIC;gallium arsenide;aluminium compounds;III-V semiconductors;feedback amplifiers;mobile radio;telephone sets;heterojunction bipolar transistors","AlGaAs/GaAs HBT MMIC power amplifier;active feedback circuit;GSM900;DCS1800;bias switch;single chip;dual-band operation;mobile phone handset;3.2 V;900 to 1800 MHz;52 percent;42 percent;AlGaAs-GaAs","","44","","53","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

If there is no change of load balancing in the system, then all the circles touch each other at the (0,0) coordinate. The circles with no load balancing are called zero load balancing change circles. The maximum load balancing loop in the network is identified by comparing the radii of all the modified zero load balancing change circles. The corresponding loop of the largest one gives the maximum improvement of load balancing in the network. Then the possible branch exchanges in the maximum load balancing loop are investigated by comparing the size of the circle for every branch-exchange. If the loads are balanced due to a branch exchange, the size of the circle diminishes and hence the smallest circle gives the maximum improvement in load balancing and the corresponding branch-exchange is considered to be the best candidate for maximum improvement in load balancing. To show the efficiency and performance of the proposed method for the solution of computationally complex and large dimensionality problems, a system with 69-bus and 7 laterals has been considered as the test system. Test results have shown that the proposed method can identify the most effective branch-exchange operations for load balancing with less computational effort and time.

Simulations have been performed to test if this cavity model also predicts the remaining resonances. It was found that the cavity model predicts some but not all of the resonances. However, it was found that all resonances in both single- and dual-polarized arrays have some dependence on the dielectric region. The resonances are effectively suppressed by introducing plated through vias in the element. The vias are positioned along the edges of the slotline, slotline cavity, stripline, and stripline stub.

In its original form, the wavelet transform is a linear tool. However, it has been increasingly recognized that nonlinear extensions are possible. A major impulse to the development of nonlinear wavelet transforms has been given by the introduction of the lifting scheme by Sweldens (1995, 1996, 1998). The aim of this paper, which is a sequel to a previous paper devoted exclusively to the pyramid transform, is to present an axiomatic framework encompassing most existing linear and nonlinear wavelet decompositions. Furthermore, it introduces some, thus far unknown, wavelets based on mathematical morphology, such as the morphological Haar wavelet, both in one and two dimensions. A general and flexible approach for the construction of nonlinear (morphological) wavelets is provided by the lifting scheme. This paper briefly discusses one example, the max-lifting scheme, which has the intriguing property that preserves local maxima in a signal over a range of scales, depending on how local or global these maxima are.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.877211","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=877211","","Signal resolution;Wavelet transforms;Morphology;Image resolution;Mathematics;Computer science;Image reconstruction;Signal processing;Image processing;Laplace equations","wavelet transforms;mathematical morphology;channel bank filters;image resolution;Haar transforms;nonlinear filters","nonlinear multiresolution signal decomposition schemes;morphological wavelets;wavelet transform;nonlinear extension;lifting scheme;axiomatic framework;wavelet decompositions;mathematical morphology;morphological Haar wavelet;max-lifting scheme","","117","","46","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a novel fuzzy logic approach is adopted to develop a computer based intelligent interpretation of transformer faults using Visual basic and C/sup ++/ programming. The proposed fuzzy logic based software as been tested and tuned using over 800 dissolved gas in oil analysis (DGA) case histories. This highly reliable tool has then been utilized in detection and verification of 20 transformer faults. The proposed diagnostic tool is very useful to both expert and novice engineers in DGA result interpretation.","1558-4135","","10.1109/94.841806","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=841806","","Fuzzy logic;Fault diagnosis;Dissolved gas analysis;Power transformers;Oil insulation;Petroleum;Fault detection;Humans;Visual BASIC;Logic programming","power transformer insulation;power transformer testing;fuzzy logic;fault diagnosis;transformer oil;insulation testing","fuzzy logic;fault diagnosis;oil insulation;power transformer;dissolved gas in oil analysis;in-service technique;computer software","","106","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The present effort describes a dual-purpose, conformal microwave applicator that is fabricated from thin, flexible, multilayer printed circuit board (PCB) material to facilitate heating of surface areas overlaying contoured anatomy. Preliminary studies document the Feasibility of combining Archimedean spiral microstrip antennas, located concentrically within the central region of square dual concentric conductor (DCC) annular slot antennas. The motivation is to achieve homogeneous tissue heating simultaneously with noninvasive thermometry by radiometric sensing of blackbody radiation from the target tissue under the applicator. Results demonstrate that the two antennas have complimentary regions of influence. The DCC ring antenna structure produces a peripherally enhanced power deposition pattern with peaks in the outer corners of the aperture and a broad minimum around 50% of maximum centrally. In contrast, the Archimedean spiral radiates (or receives) energy predominantly along the boresight axis of the spiral, thus confining the region of influence to tissue located within the central broad minimum of the DCC pattern. Analysis of the temperature-dependent radiometer signal (brightness temperature) showed linear correlation of radiometer output with test Load temperature using either the spiral or DCC structure as the receive antenna. The radiometric performance of the broadband Archimedean antenna was superior compared to the DCC, providing improved temperature resolution (0.1/spl deg/C-0.2/spl deg/C) and signal sensitivity (0.3/spl deg/C-0.8/spl deg/C//spl deg/C) at all four 500 MHz integration bandwidths tested within the frequency range from 1.2 to 3.0 GHz.","1558-2531","","10.1109/10.880102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=880102","","Microwave antennas;Electromagnetic heating;Diseases;Spirals;Microwave radiometry;Microstrip antennas;Microwave devices;Applicators;Conducting materials;Slot antennas","microwave heating;hyperthermia;skin;microstrip antennas;diseases;temperature measurement;biomedical equipment;radiation therapy","dual-mode antenna design;noninvasive thermometry;superficial tissue disease;heating equipment;thin flexible multilayer printed circuit board material;surface areas heating;Archimedean spiral microstrip antennas;peripherally enhanced power deposition pattern;square dual concentric conductor annular slot antennas;temperature resolution;integration bandwidths;homogeneous tissue heating;radiometric sensing;blackbody radiation;complimentary influence regions;medical instrumentation;500 MHz;1.2 to 3.0 GHz","Biomedical Engineering;Equipment Design;Humans;Hyperthermia, Induced;Microwaves;Neoplasms;Neoplasms;Radiometry;Skin Temperature;Thermometers","55","","46","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Experimental results show that scan angles of up to 60/spl deg/ can be achieved at a driving voltage of only 20 V. The 2-D deflection of a laser beam is obtained by a gimbal mounting of the mirror plate. For the fabrication of the devices, SOI-wafers are used as the base material.

For metal etch, HDP etch is compared reactive ion etch and the impact of individual process steps are identified by specialized antenna structures. Measurement results of Charge Pumping (CP), breakdown voltage (V/sub bd/) and gate oxide leakage are correlating very well. For HDP oxide deposition, plasma damage is minimal, assuring minimal exposure time of the metal line to the plasma using maximal deposition to sputter ratio. This process is inducing less PID than the classic SOG processing. Ar preclean induces minimal plasma damage using minimal process time, high ion energy and high plasma power. On metal etch, reactive ion etch is inducing less plasma damage then HDP etching.

A wideband balun is used to accomplish the transition from the unbalanced CPW transmission line to the balanced CPS transmission line. The balun exhibits an insertion loss of less than 3 dB in a frequency band from sub-100 kHz and up to a frequency of 3.85 GHz. The numerical results presented are based on simulations using the IE3D Version 6.03 for Windows 98. The obtained numerical results are in good agreement with experimental data. The spiral antenna is designed and prototyped for the FR-4 substrate. By placing the antenna on the FR-4 substrate it yields a low cost solution. Simulations have shown that the input impedance remains essentially constant over a bandwidth which is larger than 11 to 1. The simulated as well as the measured input impedance for the spiral antenna is 80 /spl Omega/. Measurements in an anechoic chamber have been made in order to measure the radiation pattern and the directivity of the antenna. The cavity backed spiral antenna exhibits a unidirectional radiation pattern, due to the absorbing material. Only half of the input power is transformed into radiated power due to the presence of the absorber. The simulated performance of the spiral antenna is very promising. The simulations indicated that the antenna has a radiation efficiency of more than 70% and an axial ratio and a return loss better than 3.5 dB and 10 dB, respectively, in the frequency band from 0.4 to 3.8 GHz.","","0-7803-5894-5","10.1109/APWC.2000.900133","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=900133","","Coplanar waveguides;Spirals;Frequency;Antenna measurements;Bandwidth;Impedance matching;Power transmission lines;Coplanar transmission lines;Antenna radiation patterns;Wideband","optimisation;antenna radiation patterns;antenna feeds;coplanar waveguides;spiral antennas;UHF antennas;microwave antennas;directive antennas;electric impedance;baluns","characterisation;optimisation;coplanar waveguide fed logarithmic spiral antenna;cavity backed coplanar waveguide to coplanar strip-fed antenna;return loss;wideband balun;unbalanced CPW transmission line;balanced CPS transmission line;insertion loss;IE3D Version 6.03;FR-4 substrate;input impedance;radiation pattern;directivity;cavity backed spiral antenna;unidirectional radiation pattern;absorbing material;performance;radiation efficiency;axial ratio;0.4 to 3.8 GHz;70 percent","","8","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Radar waveforms are designed to discriminate between targets possessing a doubly spread reflectivity function that are observed in clutter. The waveforms minimize decision time by maximizing the discrimination information in the echo signal. Each waveform selected maximizes the Kullback-Leibler (1951) information number that measures the dissimilarity between the observed target and the alternative targets. We discuss in details two scenarios. In the first scenario, the target environment is assumed fixed during illumination. In this case, the optimal waveform selection strategy leads to a fixed library of waveforms. During actual classification, the sequence in which the waveforms are selected from the library is determined from the noise to clutter power in the range-Doppler support of the targets. In the second scenario, the target environment changes between pulse transmissions. In this case, the maximum discrimination information is obtained by a repeated transmission of a single waveform designed from the reflectivity function of the targets. We show that our choice of signals can produce significant gains in detection performance.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.841178","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=841178","","Radar detection","radar detection;radar clutter;reflectivity;optimisation;backscatter;signal classification;Doppler effect","radar target classification;waveforms library;sequential experiment design;signal selection;radar waveforms;doubly spread reflectivity function;clutter;decision time minimisation;discrimination information;echo signal;Kullback-Leibler information number;dissimilarity measurement;target environment;optimal waveform selection;noise to clutter power;range-Doppler support;pulse transmissions;maximum discrimination information;detection performance;backscatter;radar signal design","","65","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The second is the magnetic noise, generated by vibration of the core due to the electromagnetic forces in the airgap. The third is the noise generated by the bearings. The influence of the PWM frequency inverters on the magnetic noise is also considered and results of tests performed on motors are also presented. It is shown that a reduction in the fan diameter decreases the noise emitted by the ventilating system.

The concept of energy transfer is achieved by paralleling the input and output of two step-down converter cells and operating them in antiphase. The voltage conversion ratio is determined by controlling the charging trajectories of the capacitors in each cell. As it is unnecessary for the circuit to use any inductive elements, possibilities of integrated circuit fabrication and high power density are promising.

Lyapunov stability theory is used to prove that a nonlinear observer combined with an output feedback integral controller provide exponential stability. The output feedback controller compensates for variations in thrust due to time variations in advance speed. This is a major problem when applying conventional vehicle-propeller control systems. The proposed controller is simulated for an underwater vehicle equipped with a single propeller. The simulations demonstrate that the axial water velocity can be estimated with good accuracy.

These methods provide the driver with relevant information. They are able to cope reliably with scenarios on motorways. Nevertheless, not much attention has been given to image processing approaches to increase the safety of pedestrians in urban environments. In the paper, a method for the detection, tracking, and final recognition of pedestrians crossing the moving observer's trajectory is suggested. A combination of data- and model-driven approaches is realized. The initial detection process is based on a fusion of texture analysis, model-based grouping of, most likely, the geometric features of pedestrians, and inverse-perspective mapping (binocular vision).

A UC algorithm that maximizes profit will play an essential role in developing successful bidding strategies for the competitive generator. Simply bidding to win contracts is insufficient; bidding strategies must result in contracts that, on average, cover the total generation costs. No longer guaranteed to be the only electricity supplier, a generation company's share of the demand will be more difficult to predict than in the past. Removing the obligation to serve softens the demand constraint. In this paper the authors provide a price/profit-based UC formulation which considers the softer demand constraint and allocates fixed and transitional costs to the scheduled hours. The authors describe a genetic algorithm solution to this new UC problem and present results for an illustrative example.","1558-0679","","10.1109/59.867164","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=867164","","Contracts;Genetic algorithms;Costs;Job shop scheduling;Scheduling algorithm;Industrial control;Power generation;Electricity supply industry deregulation;Power systems","power generation scheduling;power generation economics;genetic algorithms;electricity supply industry","profit-based unit commitment;competitive environment;generating units control;generation units scheduling;costs minimization;unit commitment algorithm;bidding strategies;competitive generator;demand constraint;transitional costs allocation;fixed costs allocation","","124","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Wong","Center for Integrated Syst., Stanford Univ., CA, USA; NA","Proceedings of the IEEE","","2000","88","10","1560","1571","A strong demand for wireless products, an insatiable thirst for spectrum that pushes carrier frequencies ever upward, and the constant quest for higher performance at lower power and cost, have recently driven the development of radio frequency integrated circuit (RFIC) technology in unprecedented ways. These pressures are stimulating novel solutions that allow RFICs to enjoy more of the benefits of Moore's law than has been the case in the past. In addition to regular raw transistor speed increases, the growing number of interconnect layers allows the realization of improved inductors, capacitors, and transmission lines. A deeper understanding of noise at both the device and circuit level has improved the performance of low noise amplifiers (LNAs) and oscillators. Finally, an appropriate raiding of circuit ideas dating back to the vacuum tube era enables excellent performance, even when working close to the limits of a technology. This paper surveys some of these developments in the context of low-power RF CMOS technology, with a focus on an illustrative implementation of a low-power 5-GHz wireless LAN receiver in 0.25-/spl mu/m CMOS. Thanks to these recent advances in passive components and active circuits, the blocks comprising the receiver consume a total of approximately 37 mW. These blocks include an image-reject LNA, image-reject downconverter, and a complete frequency synthesizer. The overall noise figure is 5 dB, and the input-referred third-order intercept (IIP3) is -2 dBm. To underscore that 5 GHz does not represent an upper bound by any means, this paper concludes with a look at active circuits that function beyond 15-20 GHz, and a characterization of on-chip transmission lines up to 50 GHz, all in the context of how scaling is expected to shape future developments.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.888995","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=888995","","Radio frequency;CMOS integrated circuits;Radiofrequency integrated circuits;CMOS technology;Power transmission lines;Distributed parameter circuits;Circuit noise;Noise level;Active circuits;Costs","field effect MMIC;mobile radio;integrated circuit interconnections;MMIC amplifiers;wireless LAN;frequency synthesizers;transceivers;CMOS analogue integrated circuits","RF integrated circuits;wireless products;carrier frequencies;Moore's law;interconnect layers;low noise amplifiers;CMOS technology;wireless LAN receiver;image-reject LNA;image-reject downconverter;frequency synthesizer;input-referred third-order intercept;on-chip transmission lines;5 GHz;0.25 micron;37 mW;5 dB;15 to 50 GHz","","78","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The studied destruction mode addresses the large surges, especially the short-circuit of IGBTs. In this case the reason of the device destruction is a thermal runaway. Thus we have developed an electrothermal model of the IGBT. The developed model may be implemented in any circuit simulator featuring a high level description language (SABER, ELDO, SMASH, PACTE etc.). The used electrical model is based on the Hefner model of the IGBT. A bidimensional finite element thermal model is considered. This model has been optimized to give a good trade-off between accuracy and simulation cost. To validate the implemented model, finite element simulations have been performed with the ATLAS two-dimensional (2-D) numerical simulator. The study is completed with the comparison between experimental and simulation results. It is shown that the proposed electrothermal model allows the prediction of the IGBT destruction phases in the case of large surges. So, users of IGBT components have the possibility to estimate, by mean of simulation, the possible failure (due to large surges) of these devices in the case of complex converters. This enables the possibility for developing protection systems for IGBTs without any destructive test.","1941-0107","","10.1109/63.849049","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=849049","","Electrothermal effects;Insulated gate bipolar transistors;Circuit simulation;Surge protection;Finite element methods;Cost function;Two dimensional displays;Numerical simulation;Predictive models;System testing","insulated gate bipolar transistors;semiconductor device models;short-circuit currents;surges;protection;finite element analysis;circuit simulation;failure analysis","electrothermal modeling;IGBT;short-circuit conditions;IGBT failure phenomena estimation;destruction mode;large surges;thermal runaway;electrothermal model;high level description language;circuit simulator;electrical model;Hefner model;bidimensional finite element thermal model;finite element simulations;ATLAS two-dimensional numerical simulator;complex converters;protection systems","","37","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"A novel micromachined magnetic membrane microfluid pump","M. Khoo; C. Liu","Microelectron.

No.00CH37143)","","2000","3","","2394","2397 vol.3","We present results on the design, fabrication, and testing of a new, micromachined magnetic pump for integrated microfluidic systems. Structurally, the pump consists of a magnetic microactuator and two polymer-based one-way diffuser valves. The microactuator is based on a thin membrane made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a soft silicone elastomer. Membrane displacement is caused by the interaction between ferromagnetic pieces (embedded within the thickness of the membrane) and an external magnet. This novel mechanism reduces fabrication and packaging complexity, and allows for remote operation of the micropump without any tether wires for power input. The operation is simple as no precise alignment is required between the external magnet and the pump. PDMS is biocompatible compared to silicon. One future application of this tetherless micropump is implanted biomedical microfluidic systems. We developed a novel micromachining process for embedding ferromagnetic materials within a thin, spin-cast PDMS membrane. Unique pump and diffuser mechanisms that allow for continuous pumping are also developed. Diffuser elements containing no moving parts are fabricated using polymer micromachining techniques. Micro Permalloy pieces are strategically positioned within a 2/spl times/2 mm/sup 2/, 40-/spl mu/m-thick PDMS membrane. Dimensions and locations of the membrane and the Permalloy pieces are optimized for maximum membrane vertical displacement under a given magnetic field.

We discuss how such methods, typically formulated for time-independent surfaces, can be extended to calculate scattering from time-evolving ocean-like surfaces. Estimates are provided for the choice of parameters in such time-varying simulations. The method of ordered multiple interactions (MOMI) is used to calculate time-varying scattering from surfaces generated according to linear and nonlinear (Creamer) models for incidence angles ranging from normal to low grazing. We discuss the runtime considerations and demonstrate that combining the MOMI with a fast multipole method (FMM)-type acceleration technique makes large-scale time-varying Monte Carlo simulations possible. The average Doppler spectra of backscattered signals obtained from such simulations are compared for different incident angles, polarizations, and surface models. In particular, the simulations show a broadening of the Doppler spectra for nonlinear surfaces, especially at low grazing angles (LGA) and a separation of the vertical and horizontal polarization spectra at LGA for nonlinear surfaces. This spectral separation at LGA is not observed when the linear surfaces are used.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.851961","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=851961","","Numerical simulation;Scattering;Sea surface;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Polarization;Robustness;Runtime;Acceleration;Large-scale systems","electromagnetic wave scattering;electromagnetic wave polarization;random media;absorbing media;ocean waves;time-varying systems;Monte Carlo methods;Doppler effect;integral equations;numerical analysis","scattering;time-varying randomly rough surfaces;rough surface scattering.;time-evolving ocean-like surfaces;method of ordered multiple interactions;MOMI;time-varying scattering;linear models;nonlinear models;Creamer model;incidence angles;runtime considerations;fast multipole method;FMM-type acceleration technique;large-scale time-varying Monte Carlo simulations;average Doppler spectra;backscattered signals;polarizations;surface models;Doppler spectra;nonlinear surfaces;low grazing angles;vertical polarization spectra;horizontal polarization spectra;spectral separation","","143","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For this purpose, an observer is adopted to provide estimation of the system's velocity needed by a tracking control law. The combined controller-observer scheme is designed so as to achieve exponential convergence to zero of both motion tracking and estimation errors. In order to avoid representation singularities of the orientation, unit quaternions are used to express the vehicle attitude. Implementation issues are also considered and simplified control laws are suggested, aimed at suitably trading off tracking performance against reduced computational load. Simulation case studies are carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller-observer algorithm. The obtained performance is compared to that achieved with a control scheme in which the velocity is reconstructed via numerical differentiation of position measurements. The results confirm that the chattering on the control commands is significantly reduced when the controller-observer strategy is adopted in lieu of raw numerical differentiation; this leads to lower energy consumption at the actuators and increases their lifetime.","1558-1691","","10.1109/48.855403","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=855403","","Underwater tracking;Control systems;Velocity control;Trajectory;Feedback;Motion control;Convergence;Estimation error;Quaternions;Vehicles","underwater vehicles;remotely operated vehicles;motion control;manipulator dynamics;manipulator kinematics;tracking;attitude control;state-space methods;observers;Lyapunov methods;closed loop systems;convergence of numerical methods;position control;feedback","underwater vehicle-manipulator system;tracking control;velocity estimation;motion trajectory;controller-observer scheme;control law;exponential convergence to zero;estimation errors;motion tracking errors;unit quaternions;vehicle attitude;reduced computational load;numerical differentiation;position measurements;chattering;control commands;autonomous vehicle;nonlinear observer;closed loop system;output feedback;Lyapunov stability analysis;open kinematic chain;dynamics;state-space domain;compensation","","70","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Analytical studies of the watermarking problem have typically been based on studying the performance limits of these known algorithms. In contrast, this paper formalizes the watermarking problem in an ""algorithm independent"" framework, representing any watermarking algorithm as a partition of the image space into a collection of sets, and defining requirements of these sets that must be met by any solution to the watermarking problem. Specifically, these requirements define and constrain the false-alarm ratio, distortion, robustness and security of a watermarking system. Using this formalism, we first characterize common features of algorithms that solve the watermarking problem. We show how the requirements defined earlier force important differences between watermarking signal sets and classical communication systems signal sets. Next, we show how common components of existing watermarking algorithms (e.g. transformations, projections, and coding) can be associated with specific requirements of the watermarking definition.

In addition, this document presents the rationale, design and results of psychophysical experiments that were conducted to address some key issues that arose during PicHunter's development. The PicHunter project makes four primary contributions to research on CBIR. First, PicHunter represents a simple instance of a general Bayesian framework which we describe for using relevance feedback to direct a search. With an explicit model of what users would do, given the target image they want, PicHunter uses Bayes's rule to predict the target they want, given their actions. This is done via a probability distribution over possible image targets, rather than by refining a query. Second, an entropy-minimizing display algorithm is described that attempts to maximize the information obtained from a user at each iteration of the search. Third, PicHunter makes use of hidden annotation rather than a possibly inaccurate/inconsistent annotation structure that the user must learn and make queries in. Finally, PicHunter introduces two experimental paradigms to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the system, and psychophysical experiments are presented that support the theoretical claims.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.817596","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=817596","","Bayesian methods;Image retrieval;Psychology;Feedback;Content based retrieval;Image databases;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Prototypes;Predictive models","Bayes methods;content-based retrieval;psychology;software performance evaluation;digital libraries;relevance feedback;probability;information retrieval systems","Bayesian image retrieval system;PicHunter;psychophysics;design principles;performance;content-based image retrieval;relevance feedback;directed search;probability distribution;image targets;entropy-minimizing display algorithm;information maximization;iteration;hidden annotation;digital libraries","","397","","82","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The key design objectives for the processor systems in these applications are providing the highest possible peak performance for the compute-intensive code (e.g., handwriting recognition, image decompression) while maximizing the battery life for the remaining low performance periods. If clock frequency and supply voltage are dynamically varied in response to computational load demands, then energy consumed per process can be reduced for the low computational periods, while retaining peak performance when required. This strategy, which achieves the highest possible energy efficiency for time-varying computational loads, is called dynamic voltage scaling (DVS).","0193-6530","0-7803-5853-8","10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839787","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839787","","Dynamic voltage scaling;Microprocessors;Portable computers;Time varying systems;High performance computing;Handwriting recognition;Batteries;Clocks;Frequency;Energy efficiency","microprocessor chips;low-power electronics","dynamic voltage scaling;microprocessor;portable electronic device;energy efficiency;time-varying computational load;design","","163","","3","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Also, it has been shown that a proper selection of a coefficient of the disturbance observer is capable to improve robust stability, while not influencing basic performance. The proposed strategy can realize acceleration control and second derivative of force control in the task space, which realizes robust and precise control of manipulators.

No.00CH37058)","","2000","1","","460","467 vol.1","A topological review of the single stage power factor corrected (PFC) rectifiers is presented in this paper. Most of reported single-stage PFC rectifiers cascade a boost type converter with a forward or a flyback DC-DC converter so that input current shaping, isolation, and fast output voltage regulation are performed in one single stage. The cost and performance of a single-stage PFC converters depend greatly on how its input current shaper (ICS) and the DC-DC converter are integrated together. For the cascade connected single-stage PFC rectifiers, the energy storage capacitor is found in either series or parallel path of energy flow. The second group appears to represent the main stream. Therefore, the focus of this paper is on this group. It is found that many of these topologies can be implemented by combining a 2-terminal or 3-terminal boost ICS cell with DC-DC converter along with an energy storage capacitor in between. A general rule is observed that translates a 3-terminal ICS cell to a 2-terminal ICS cell using an additional winding from the transformer and vice versa. According to the translation rule, many of reported single-stage PFC topologies can be viewed as electrically equivalent to one another. Several new PFC converters were derived from some existing topologies using the translation rule.","","0-7803-5864-3","10.1109/APEC.2000.826144","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=826144","","Reactive power;Rectifiers;DC-DC power converters;Costs;Circuit topology;Voltage control;Energy storage;Capacitors;Power system harmonics;Power harmonic filters","power factor correction;DC-DC power convertors;rectifying circuits;voltage control;capacitors","single-stage power factor corrector;boost type input-current-shaper;single-stage PFC rectifiers cascade;flyback DC-DC converter;forward DC-DC converter;input current shaping;isolation;fast output voltage regulation;energy storage capacitor;energy flow;parallel path;3-terminal boost ICS cell;2-terminal boost ICS cell;transformer winding","","14","","48","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is the imaging modality of choice for detecting abnormalities of the brain, spine and musculoskeletal systems. It is on the verge of widespread application in diagnosis of cardiovascular disease and in image guided surgery. While permanent and resistive magnets are used for low field applications (""open"" MRI) most systems use high field superconducting magnets making MRI the largest commercial application of superconductivity. The MRI magnet is the largest and most expensive component in the MRI system. Magnet configuration is the determining factor in MRI system architecture and directly connected to issues such as patient comfort, ease of siting, life cycle cost and functionality. All of these factors drive magnet requirements. Thus, MRI magnet requirements are determined by a combination of MRI system needs, technical requirements and market forces, plus the need for continuous reduction of both magnet-acquisition cost and total cost of ownership. Cost of ownership, in turn, includes siting, installation, operation and service. In this paper we trace the evolution of superconducting MRI magnet systems-taking note of the importance of advances in cryogenic technology and design practice-as they have responded to both market forces and competing magnet technologies.","1558-2515","","10.1109/77.828339","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=828339","","Magnetic resonance imaging;Superconducting magnets;Cardiovascular diseases;Noninvasive treatment;Cardiac disease;Musculoskeletal system;Surgery;Superconductivity;Cost function;Cryogenics","superconducting magnets;biomedical MRI;surgery;life cycle costing;cryogenics","MRI magnets;noninvasive diagnosis;brain;spine;musculoskeletal systems;cardiovascular disease;image guided surgery;high field superconducting magnets;magnet configuration;system architecture;life cycle cost;magnet-acquisition cost;cryogenic technology;design practice","","42","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
