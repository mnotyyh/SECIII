The NJU head consists of two eye modules, each of which can perform its own independent pan and tilt motions. A neck module drives the head to perform pan and tilt motions which are independent of those of the eye modules. In addition, the two cameras of the head-eye platform can focus and zoom according to the changing environments.

Mutation testing is a commonly used defect injection technique for evaluating the effectiveness of a test suite. However, it is usually computationally expensive, as a large number of mutants (buggy versions) are needed to be generated from a production code under test and executed against the test suite. In order to reduce the expensive testing cost, recent studies proposed to use supervised models to predict the effectiveness of a test suite without executing the test suite against the mutants. Nonetheless, the training of such a supervised model requires labeled data, which still depends on the costly mutant execution. Furthermore, existing models are based on traditional supervised learning techniques, which assumes that the training and testing data come from the same distribution. But, in practice, software systems are subject to considerable concept drifts, i.e. the same distribution assumption usually does not hold. This can lead to inaccurate predictions of a learned supervised model on the target code as time progresses. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we propose a Coverage-Based Unsupervised Approach (CBUA) for evaluating the effectiveness of a test suite. The whole process only requires a one-time execution of the test suite against the target production code, without involving any mutant execution and any training data. CBUA can ensure the score monotonicity property (i.e. adding test cases to a test suite does not decrease its mutation score), which may be violated by a supervised approach. The experimental results show that CBUA is very competitive to the state-of-the-art supervised approaches in terms of the prediction accuracy. Since CBUA is an easy-to-implement model with a low cost, we suggest that it should be used as a baseline approach for comparison when any novel prediction approach is proposed in future studies.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2020.3010361","the National Key R and D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9144443","Effectiveness;test suites;coverage;unsupervised model;mutation testing","Testing;Predictive models;Production;Data models;Computational modeling;Training;Training data","","","","","","","","20 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The basic idea is that a moving antenna can obtain RF-signals from the tags attached on packages with the 1D linear mobile scanning. Through extracting phase differences to build angle profiles for each tag, RF-3DScan derives their relative positions, further determine the package orientation and the coarse-grained package stacking. By simply performing the 2D scanning, RF-3DScan can provide fine-grained package stacking determination. We implement a prototype system of RF-3DScan and evaluate its performance in real settings. Our experiment results show that RF-3DScan can achieve about 92.5% identification accuracy of the bottom face, and average error about 4.08° of the rotation angle.

To investigate the key design parameters including the masking efficiency, transmitting optical power and mismatch coefficient, we give the calculation model of the bit error ratio (BER) based on traditional space laser optical communication system from the perspective of the authorized receiver and eavesdropper. Numerical results indicate that the BER for the eavesdropper is sensitive to the masking efficiency but not to the transmitting optical power.

Little work, however, has addressed race condition problems related to hardware interrupts. In this paper, we present SDRacer, an automated framework that can detect, validate and repair race conditions in interrupt-driven embedded software. It uses a combination of static analysis and symbolic execution to generate input data for exercising the potential races. It then employs virtual platforms to dynamically validate these races by forcing the interrupts to occur at the potential racing points. Finally, it provides repair candidates to eliminate the detected races. We evaluate SDRacer on nine real-world embedded programs written in C language. The results show that SDRacer can precisely detect and successfully fix race conditions.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2020.2989171","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9072666","Embedded Software;Interrupts;Race Condition;Software Testing;Repair Suggestion","Task analysis;Maintenance engineering;Hardware;Embedded systems;Concurrent computing;Testing;Embedded software","","","","","","","","20 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Comparing with the in-parallel laser array, the in-series one can avoid a large power loss caused by the optical combiner. However, the single-mode stability of an in-series laser array is vulnerable to the reflections of other lasers. Here we experimentally demonstrated a tunable in-series laser array with high single-mode stability and high uniformity of wavelength spacing. To reduce the impact of such reflections, the Bragg gratings in different lasers were designed in phase, and the grating phase error was reduced by utilizing the reconstruction-equivalent-chirp technique. Besides, a three-section laser structure was applied in each laser to increase the priority of the dominant lasing mode. Four lasers with small wavelength-spacings of 2.5 nm were integrated in the in-series laser array. According to the measurement results of 40 in-series laser arrays (160 lasers), wavelength deviations of 90.6% lasers were within ±0.2 nm, average wavelength spacings of 97.5% of the measured laser arrays were deviated from the design within ±0.2 nm, and SMSRs of 96.3% lasers were above 45 dB. The output power was above 25 mW and the relative intensity noise was below -130 dB/Hz. Like the in-parallel laser array, the proposed laser array can be applied in either continuous wavelength tuning or fast channel switching. For the continuous wavelength tuning applications, the 10-nm tuning range was obtained with a temperature tuning range of less than 20 °C. For the fast channel switching applications, 4 channels with 2.5-nm spacing are available, and the switching time between two channels was less than 300 ns.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2020.3005828","Chinese National Key Basic Research Special Fund; Jiangsu Science and Technology Project; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Suzhou technological innovation of key industries; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9128048","Semiconductor laser;tunable laser;wavelength division multiplexing;multi-wavelength laser array;distributed feedback laser","","","","","","","","","29 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

One fundamental problem for a DSP is to decide where to place service entities to achieve low-delay pairwise interactions between DIA users, under the constraint that the total placement cost is no more than a specified budget threshold. In this paper, we formally model the service entity placement problem and prove that it is NP-complete by a polynomial reduction from the set cover problem.

In this paper, we present a video stabilization solution in mobile devices via inertial-visual state tracking. Specifically, during the video shoot, we use the gyroscope to estimate the rotation of camera, and use the structure-from-motion among the image frames to estimate the translation of camera. We build a camera projection model by considering the rotation and translation of the camera, and the camera motion model to depict the relationship between the inertial-visual state and the camera's 3D motion. By fusing the inertial measurement (IMU)-based method and the computer vision (CV)-based method, our solution is robust to the fast movement and violent jitters, moreover, it greatly reduces the computation overhead in video stabilization. In comparison to the IMU-based solution, our solution can estimate the translation in a more accurate manner, since we use the feature point pairs in adjacent image frames, rather than the error-prone accelerometers, to estimate the translation. In comparison to the CV-based solution, our solution can estimate the translation with less number of feature point pairs, since the number of undetermined degrees of freedom in the 3D motion directly reduces from 6 to 3. We implemented a prototype system on smart glasses and smart phones, and evaluated the performance under real scenarios, i.e., the human subjects used mobile devices to shoot videos while they were walking, climbing or riding. The experiment results show that our solution achieves 32% better performance than the state-of-art solutions in regard to video stabilization. Moreover, the average processing time latency is 32.6ms, which is lower than the conventional inter-frame time interval, i.e., 33ms, and thus meets the real-time requirement for online processing.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2019.2961313","The Key R and D Program of Jiangsu Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8937481","Video Stabilization;Mobile Device;3D Motion Sensing;Inertial-Visual State Tracking","Cameras;Mobile handsets;Three-dimensional displays;Jitter;Tracking;Streaming media;Gyroscopes","","","","","","","","20 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Furthermore, POMP++ utilizes Value-set Analysis, which helps to verify memory alias relation, to improve the ability of data flow recovery. With the restored data flow, POMP++ then performs backward taint analysis and highlights program statements that actually contribute to the crash.

Most P2P systems replicate the most frequently accessed data objects to improve system performance. However, existing replication strategies cannot answer the question that how many replicas of an object should be kept in the P2P system. If an object is replicated excessively, it inevitably will affect the average efficiency of a replica, which will decrease the whole search performance. This paper addresses the issue of finding the proper number of replicas for an object according to its query rate. In this paper, we firstly investigate the precise relation among success rate, the allocation of replicas and query rate.

In practice, a successful GaaS platform need to operate in a transparent mode without requiring substantial efforts from both content providers and end users, and offer the pristine quality of experience (QoE) at an affordable cost. Our analysis suggests that GaaS provisioning cost can be reduced significantly by enforcing the game video rendering and streaming at a lower resolution (so as to increase the user concurrency in the cloud and reduce the streaming bandwidth over the network). However, streaming video at a lower resolution may deteriorate the QoE. To maintain the client QoE at the level using the default-native resolution for streaming or even enhance it, we introduce the learned resolution scaling (LRS), which leverages the computational capabilities at clients/edges to restore/improve the reconstructed image/video quality via stacked deep neural networks (DNN). We integrate this LRS into a commercialized GaaS platform - AnyGame, to study its efficiency and complexity quantitatively. Extensive real-life experiments have shown that LRS-powered AnyGame offers the state-of-the-art performance, and the lower operational cost, paving the road for a potential success of GaaS over the Internet.

And the blackouts issue studied in this paper, described as losing all the data during a certain period, is among the most urgent issues due to its devastating impact on service quality, and is challenging because of the absence of coevolving data sequences for reference. As a result, many existing approaches that rely on data from other coevolving sequences for missing value recovery are infeasible in handling blackouts. To address the issue, this work proposes a novel Hankel matrix factorization approach, HKMF-T, to recover missing values during blackouts for tagged time series, where a tagged time series consists of a data sequence and a corresponding tag sequence. Motivated by real-world observations, HKMF-T decomposes the data sequence into two components: 1) an internal, slowly-varying smooth trend, and 2) external impacts indicated by the tag sequence. By transforming a partially observed data sequence into a corresponding Hankel matrix, we learn the above two components and estimate the missing values under a unified framework of Hankel matrix factorization. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the practical performance of HKMF-T on real-world data sets. And the results suggest HKMF-T outperforms the baseline approaches for blackouts with long durations.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2020.2971190","the Collaborative Innovation Center of Novel Software Technology and Industrialization; National Key R and D Program of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8979178","Tagged Time Series;Missing Value Imputation;Blackouts;Hankel Matrix Factorization","Time series analysis;Matrix decomposition;Market research;Meteorology;Sparse matrices;Indexes;Software","","","","","","","","3 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The data of monthly NDVI / MODIS data, with a spatial resolution of 0.05 deg from 2003 to 2008 were used in this study. The results showed that the yearly variations of NDVI were well corresponding to the growth and decline of vegetation and seasonal changes, which showed obvious phenological phenomena. Correlation analysis presented that with increasing in temperature and precipitation, NDVI increased gradually and vegetations grew well. Moreover, the influence of the precipitation on vegetation was slightly lower than that of the temperature. From 2003 to 2008, the change of NDVI showed a gradual upward trend except the low value in 2006. In the growing seasons, NDVI from 2003 to 2008, roughly showed an upward trend; in non-growing seasons, NDVI showed a roughly linear downward trend. The spatial distribution of NDVI in the west Lake Baikal was relatively lower, and the highest value appeared in the north, followed by the south and east. Different vegetation types emerged in the different NDVI values. NDVI of the tundra was the lowest, followed by scrub and agricultural land, the NDVI values of the wetlands and grassland were relatively high, and the NDVI value of forest lands was the maximum.","2161-0258","978-1-4244-7303-8","10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2010.5567661","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5567661","NDVI;temporal and spatial variations;Lake Baikal;climate factor","Vegetation mapping;Vegetation;Lakes;Meteorology;Remote sensing;Temperature;Monitoring","atmospheric precipitation;atmospheric temperature;ecology;lakes;phenology;radiometry;vegetation;vegetation mapping","temporal variations;spatial variations;lake Baikal;terrestrial vegetation;NDVI variations;vegetation growth;socio-economic constructions;remote sensing;climate change;Siberia;MODIS data;AD 2003 to 2008;phenological phenomena;correlation analysis;agricultural land;wetlands;grassland;temperature factor;precipitation factor","","","","11","","9 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, contexts are often inaccurate or even conflicting with each other (a.k.a. context inconsistency). To prevent applications from behaving abnormally or even failing, one promising approach is to deploy constraint checking to detect context inconsistencies. A variety of constraint checking techniques have been proposed, based on different incremental or parallel mechanisms for the efficiency. They are commonly deployed with the strategy that schedules constraint checking immediately upon context changes. This assures no missed inconsistency, but also limits the detection efficiency. One may break the limit by grouping context changes for checking together, but this can cause severe inconsistency missing problem (up to 79.2%). In this article, we propose a novel strategy GEAS to isolate latent interferences among context changes and schedule constraint checking with adaptive group sizes. This makes GEAS not only improve the detection efficiency, but also assure no missed inconsistency with theoretical guarantee. We experimentally evaluated GEAS with large-volume real-world context data. The results show that GEAS achieved significant efficiency gains for context inconsistency detection by $38.8 - 566.7\%$ (or $1.4\times - 6.7\times)$.

Specifically, we first obtain class-aware disentangled maps (CADMs) by reforming deep activations in accordance with the class-specific recognition weights. Then, after transforming CADMs into the corresponding label vectors, we propose an embedding operation from a metric learning perspective to pull the relevant label vectors together and push irrelevant label vectors away. Furthermore, a ranking operation is employed, which aims to accurately and robustly measure the similarity/dissimilarity of these label vectors. Our model can be trained in an end-to-end manner with only image-level supervision, during which the proposed embedding and ranking operations can contribute to the CADMs learning through back-propagation. In addition, the obtained CADMs are aggregated and further used as an essential feature stream for the final multi-label classification.

In order to manage all the traffic videos automatically, in this paper, a real-time auto-surveillance system is presented. The freeway traffic videos are taken as input video from Pan Tilt Zoom (PTZ) camera, and then produces an analysis of the states and activity of the vehicles, if there is any abnormal instance, an alarm is sent to awake surveillants. To achieve this functionality, our system relies on three main procedures. The first one initializes the system. It detects the ROI (region of interested) of the scene, and performs the camera calibration to remove the perspective effect of the incoming image. The second one segments moving vehicles from the images and tracks them real-time. It uses a set of methods to extracts the moving regions and tracks these moving regions by matching them between frames of the video sequence to obtain high-level information. In the third procedure, activities of vehicles are analyzed based on a series of preset situations which would happen on freeway. The detail information of each vehicle and the global statistical information are checked to find out any abnormal instance, and then triggered an alarm. We present details of the system, together with experiment results which demonstrate the accuracy and time responses","","0-7803-9586-7","10.1109/ITST.2006.288825","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4068556","Auto-surveillance;real-time;vehicle;activity analysis;freeway;camera calibration;moving detection;track;pan tilt zoom camera;traffic video","Traffic control;Cameras;Road vehicles;Surveillance;Monitoring;Real time systems;Layout;Calibration;Image segmentation;Data mining","feature extraction;image matching;image segmentation;image sequences;road traffic;road vehicles;video cameras;video signal processing;video surveillance","video based surveillance system;traffic monitoring;real-time auto-surveillance system;freeway traffic video;Pan Tilt Zoom camera;PTZ;ROI;region of interest;camera calibration;feature extraction;video sequence;high-level information;global statistical information","","6","","6","","22 Jan 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, the term is popularly used to refer to low-level code scripts running on a blockchain platform. Our study focuses exclusively on this subset of smart contracts. Such smart contracts have increasingly been gaining ground, finding numerous important applications (e.g., crowdfunding) in the real world. Despite the increasing popularity, smart contract development still remains somewhat a mystery to many developers largely due to its special design and applications. Are there any differences between smart contract development and traditional software development? What kind of challenges are faced by developers during smart contract development? Questions like these are important but have not been explored by researchers yet. In this paper, we performed an exploratory study to understand the current state and potential challenges developers are facing in developing smart contracts on blockchains, with a focus on Ethereum (the most popular public blockchain platform for smart contracts). Toward this end, we conducted this study in two phases. In the first phase, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 developers from GitHub and industry professionals who are working on smart contracts. In the second phase, we performed a survey on 232 practitioners to validate the findings from the interviews. Our interview and survey results revealed several major challenges developers are facing during smart contract development: (1) there is no effective way to guarantee the security of smart contract code; (2) existing tools for development are still very basic; (3) the programming languages and the virtual machines still have a number of limitations; (4) performance problems are hard to handle under resource constrained running environment; and (5) online resources (including advanced/updated documents and community support) are still limited.

Existing work proposes some efficient protocols but suffers from two defects: slot waste and data redundancy. To address these problems, we in this paper propose a two-phase grouping scheme that improves the grouping efficiency via slot reuse as well as data compression. For slot waste, we try to reconcile collision slots and turn some of them into useful again by re-assigning a new slot to collision tags, which increases the number of useful slots and reduces slot waste. For data redundancy, we encode group IDs with lossless coding algorithms and reduce the data redundancy caused by repetitive transmission of group IDs. Two coding methods, Huffman coding and arithmetic coding, are adopted to shorten the length of the bit vector comprised by group IDs. Theoretical analyses and extensive simulations show that our best protocol improves the time efficiency by 51.9% compared with the state-of-the-art.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2020.2972386","Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities; Jiangsu Key R and D Plan; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; Collaborative Innovation Center of Novel Software Technology and Industrialization; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8986541","RFID system;Tag grouping;Collision reconciliation;Data compression","Protocols;Radiofrequency identification;Mobile computing;Redundancy;Huffman coding","","","","","","","","7 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

For optimization of noisy tasks, evolutionary algorithms (EAs), a type of stochastic metaheuristic search algorithm, have been widely and successfully applied. Previous work mainly focuses on the empirical study and design of EAs for optimization under noisy conditions, while the theoretical understandings are largely insufficient. In this study, we first investigate how noisy fitness can affect the running time of EAs. Two kinds of noise-helpful problems are identified, on which the EAs will run faster with the presence of noise, and thus the noise should not be handled. Second, on a representative noise-harmful problem in which the noise has a strong negative effect, we examine two commonly employed mechanisms dealing with noise in EAs: reevaluation and threshold selection. The analysis discloses that using these two strategies simultaneously is effective for the one-bit noise but ineffective for the asymmetric one-bit noise. Smooth threshold selection is then proposed, which can be proved to be an effective strategy to further improve the noise tolerance ability in the problem. We then complement the theoretical analysis by experiments on both synthetic problems as well as two combinatorial problems, the minimum spanning tree and the maximum matching. The experimental results agree with the theoretical findings and also show that the proposed smooth threshold selection can deal with the noise better.","1063-6560","","10.1162/evco_a_00170","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8306392","Noisy optimization;evolutionary algorithms;reevaluation;threshold selection;running time;computational complexity.","","","","","4","","","Traditional","2 Mar 2018","","","MITP",""

This paper proposes a new precision-scalable architecture which can fully reduce the computational complexity in CNN inference and meanwhile has a finely simplified calculation scheme. Based on the proposed scheme, a well-optimized multiplier called Compositional Processing Element (C-PE) is devised. Compared with the previous multipliers, the new C-PE requires less area and power.

It is relatively easier to segment prostate from MR images than from CT images, due to better soft tissue contrast of the MR images. For segmenting prostate from CT images, most previous methods mainly used CT alone, and thus their performances are often limited by low tissue contrast in the CT images. In this paper, we explore the possibility of using indirect guidance from MR images for improving prostate segmentation in the CT images. In particular, we propose a novel deep transfer learning approach, i.e., MR-guided CT network training (namely MICS-NET), which can employ MR images to help better learning of features in CT images for prostate segmentation. In MICS-NET, the guidance from MRI consists of two steps: (1) learning informative and transferable features from MRI and then transferring them to CT images in a cascade manner, and (2) adaptively transferring the prostate likelihood of MRI model (i.e., well-trained convnet by purely using MR images) with a view consistency constraint. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate MICS-NET on a real CT prostate image set, with the manual delineations available as the ground truth for evaluation. Our methods generate promising segmentation results which achieve (1) six percentages higher Dice Ratio than the CT model purely using CT images and (2) comparable performance with the MRI model purely using MR images.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2019.2960153","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8933421","Prostate Segmentation;Deep Transfer Learning;Fully Convolutional Network;Cascade Learning;View Consistency Constraint","Computed tomography;Image segmentation;Magnetic resonance imaging;Training;Biomedical imaging;Informatics;Planning","","","","","","","","16 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

An ideal fault localization technique would provide precise information while requiring moderate computational resources—to best support an efficient search for correct fixes. In contrast, most automated program repair tools use standard fault localization techniques—which are not tightly integrated with the overall program repair process, and hence deliver only subpar efficiency. In this paper, we present retrospective fault localization: a novel fault localization technique geared to the requirements of automated program repair. A key idea of retrospective fault localization is to reuse the outcome of failed patch validation to support mutation-based dynamic analysis—providing accurate fault localization information without incurring onerous computational costs. We implemented retrospective fault localization in a tool called RESTORE—based on the JAID Java program repair system. Experiments involving faults from the DEFECTS4J standard benchmark indicate that retrospective fault localization can boost automated program repair: RESTORE efficiently explores a large fix space, delivering state-of-the-art effectiveness (41 DEFECTS4J bugs correctly fixed, 8 of which no other automated repair tool for Java can fix) while simultaneously boosting performance (speedup over 3 compared to JAID). Retrospective fault localization is applicable to any automated program repair techniques that rely on fault localization and dynamic validation of patches.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2020.2987862","the Hong Kong Polytechnic University Internal Fund; Research Grants Council University Grants Committee; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Fundamental Research Research Funds for The Central Universities; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Frderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9068412","","Maintenance engineering;Tools;Java;Computer bugs;Software;Standards;Electronic mail","","","","","","","","15 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In practice, the interaction between the users and the recommender system might be sparse, i.e., the users are not always interacting with the recommender system. For example, some users prefer to sweep around the recommendation instead of clicking into the details. Therefore, a response of 0 may not necessarily be a negative response, but a non-response. It comes worse to distinguish these two situations when only one item is recommended to the user each time and few further information is reachable. Most existing recommendation strategies ignore the difference between non-responses and negative responses. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to make online recommendations via sparse interactions. We design a contextual bandit algorithm, named hSAOR, for online recommendation. Our method makes probabilistic estimations on whether the user is interacting or not, by reasonably assuming that similar items are similarly attractive. It uses positive and negative responses to build the user preference model, ignoring all non-responses.

Unlike supervised learning, weakly supervised learning, however, may sometimes even degenerate performance. Such deficiency definitely hinders the deployment of weakly supervised learning to real applications. For this reason, it is desired to study safe weakly supervised learning. In this paper we present a generic ensemble learning scheme to derive the safe prediction. We consider optimizing the worst-case performance gain which leads to a maximin optimization. Our resultant formulation brings multiple advantages. Firstly, for many commonly used convex loss functions in classification and regression tasks, our formulation is guaranteed to derive a safe prediction under a mild condition. Secondly, prior knowledge related to the weight of the base weakly supervised learners can be flexibly embedded. Thirdly, our formulation can be globally and efficiently addressed. Finally, it is in an intuitive geometric interpretation.

In this paper, we show that Time-Division Duplex (TDD) systems are insecure as well. In particular, we show that it is possible to eavesdrop on other users' downloads by tuning training sequences. In order to defend MU-MIMO against such threats, we propose a secure CSI estimation scheme, which can provide correct estimates of CSI when adversarial users are in presence. We prove that our scheme is secure against training sequence based eavesdropping attack. We have implemented our scheme for TDD MU-MIMO systems and performed a series of experiments. Results demonstrate that our secure CSI estimation scheme is highly effective in protecting TDD MIMO networks against eavesdropping attack. Furthermore, we extend our scheme to support massive MU-MIMO networks, with a carefully redesigned uplink protocol and optimized power allocation to achieve higher spectral efficiency. To be more practical, we also take mismatch channel issue into our consideration.

Quantities of social media information distributes on different Online Social Networks (OSNs) in different modalities, which provides rich, wide coverage, comprehensive information about the trending events.

However, existing single-OSN search mainly involves with single modality on single platform. Moreover, most OSNs usually focus on biased perspective of events, which significantly limits the coverage and diversity of single-OSN based event search. In this paper, we introduce a novel cross-OSN solution to help integrate these cross-OSN information regarding the same event and provide an immersive experience for information retrieval. Since social media information is widely distributed in different OSNs where semantic gap exists among these heterogeneous spaces, we propose to utilize hashtag and tag, which are user-generated metadata for organizing and labeling in many OSNs, as bridges to connect between different OSNs. In our four-stage solution framework, various methods are adopted for hashtag and tag filtering, search results representation, clustering and demonstration. Given an event query, in the first stage we generate related items with corresponding tags and hashtags from OSNs and filter the hashtags and tags we need. Then, topical representation is generated for hashtag and tag. The third stage leverages the derived representation for cross-OSN hashtag and tag clustering. Finally, demonstration for each query is produced and the results are organized hierarchically.

We find that in a circular sensor network with a nonuniform node distribution and constant data reporting, the unbalanced energy depletion among the nodes in the whole network is unavoidable. This is because although all the inner nodes have used up their energy simultaneously, the outmost part of the network may still have energy left. In spite of this fact, a suboptimal energy efficiency among the inner parts of the network is possible if the number of nodes increases with geometric proportion from the outer parts to the inner ones. In our proposed nonuniform node distribution strategy, the ratio between the node densities of the adjacent (i+1)th corona and the ith corona is equal to (2i-1)/q(2i+1), where q is the geometric proportion mentioned above. We also present a routing algorithm with this node distribution strategy.

Therefore, possessing industry cluster does not mean possessing the economic competitiveness, the formation of innovation network is the source of competitive advantage in the cluster. Gradually, how to promote the formation of innovation network of industry cluster in developing countries becomes an urgent problem of decision-makers to explore and solve. In this paper, we introduce the knowledge network in the cluster innovation system, review the development of clustering coefficient and the clustering coefficient of weighted network, analyze the mechanism to form the advantage of cluster innovation, then discuss the effects of clustering coefficient on the innovation ability of the industry cluster. According to the analysis, the larger the clustering coefficient of weighted knowledge network is, the stronger the innovation ability of the industry cluster is; and the clustering coefficient will be reduced step by step with the time evolution. Finally, this paper gives the compensation strategies of the clustering coefficient in order to create continuing power for the cluster innovation.

It is necessary to propagate the topological or location changes caused by the sink movement across the network for successful data delivery. However, previous studies on using mobile sink either assume that some global information of the network is already available or let the mobile sink convey the global information through repeated network-wide broadcasting. As a result, the gains in network lifetime from sink mobility can be offset by the broadcasting which incurs extra high energy loss. To address this problem, we propose dual-sink, an energy-efficient and distributed protocol for data collection in wireless sensor networks. Both a mobile sink and a static sink are used by Dual-Sink. The mobile sink only needs to broadcast its location to a subset of nodes in the network each time when it stops. Simulation results show that when it scales up, the network using Dual-Sink enjoys steady lifetime improvement from sink mobility, whereas the network with only one mobile sink performs no better than the network with a single static sink.","1095-2055","978-1-4244-1250-1","10.1109/ICCCN.2007.4318000","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4318000","","Wireless sensor networks;Broadcasting;Energy efficiency;Energy loss;Mobile computing;Laboratories;Wireless application protocol;Energy consumption;Mathematical programming;Relays","mobile radio;protocols;telecommunication network reliability;wireless sensor networks","mobile sink;static sinks;network lifetime improvement;wireless sensor networks;data delivery;network-wide broadcasting;energy-efficient protocol;distributed protocol;dual-sink protocol","","33","","12","","24 Sep 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Whereas the quality and usefulness of SAs and SAPs have been extensively studied in the literature, in this article we aim to develop faster algorithms for SA search and frequent SAP mining. For the former problem, we leverage distances to prune the search space, and implement a distance oracle to balance the time and space for distance calculation. For the latter problem, we exploit both graph structure and labels to induce fine-grained skeleton-based partitions of SAs, which may be pruned to reduce SAP enumeration. Besides, we generate canonical codes for SAs, which not only enable result deduplication but also are reused in SAP mining to improve the overall performance. We extensively evaluate the efficiency of our algorithms on four large graphs, using both random queries and simulated queries which reproduce the extreme case of finding numerous SAs.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2019.2942031","National Key R and D Program of China; Government of Jiangsu Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8840897","Semantic association search;entity relationship search;frequent tree pattern mining;semantic data summarization","Search problems;Semantics;Data mining;Partitioning algorithms;Skeleton;Indexes;Google","","","","","","","","17 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Evolutionary algorithms are often employed in noisy optimization, where reducing the negative effect of noise is a crucial issue. Sampling is a popular strategy for dealing with noise: to estimate the fitness of a solution, it evaluates the fitness multiple () times independently and then uses the sample average to approximate the true fitness. Obviously, sampling can make the fitness estimation closer to the true value, but also increases the estimation cost. Previous studies mainly focused on empirical analysis and design of efficient sampling strategies, while the impact of sampling is unclear from a theoretical viewpoint. In this article, we show that sampling can speed up noisy evolutionary optimization exponentially via rigorous running time analysis. For the (11)-EA solving the OneMax and the LeadingOnes problems under prior (e.g., one-bit) or posterior (e.g., additive Gaussian) noise, we prove that, under a high noise level, the running time can be reduced from exponential to polynomial by sampling. The analysis also shows that a gap of one on the value of  for sampling can lead to an exponential difference on the expected running time, cautioning for a careful selection of . We further prove by using two illustrative examples that sampling can be more effective for noise handling than parent populations and threshold selection, two strategies that have shown to be robust to noise. Finally, we also show that sampling can be ineffective when noise does not bring a negative impact.","1063-6560","","10.1162/evco_a_00201","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8391029","Robust optimization;optimization in noisy environments;evolutionary algorithms;running time analysis;computational complexity.","","","","","3","","","Traditional","20 Jun 2018","","","MITP",""

In this paper, we propose a novel coding-aware multi-path routing protocol (CAMP), which forwards packets over multiple paths dynamically based on path reliability and coding opportunity. CAMP employs a route discovery mechanism which returns to the source multiple paths along with ETX (Expected Transmission Count) of all links on each path. Using a novel forwarding mechanism, CAMP splits the traffic among multiple paths and actively creates instead of passively waiting for coding opportunity by switching its path to maximize the switching gain. Experimental results demonstrate that CAMP can achieve much higher throughput than comparable schemes for delivering packets in wireless networks.","2374-9628","978-1-4244-3368-1","10.1109/PCCC.2008.4745146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4745146","","Spread spectrum communication;Wireless networks;Routing protocols;Throughput;Network coding;Telecommunication traffic;Switches;Packet switching;Computer networks;Laboratories","encoding;multipath channels;packet radio networks;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication traffic","coding;multipath routing protocol;multihop wireless networks;reliability;latency;packet delivery;coding-aware multipath routing protocol;expected transmission count","","18","","22","","9 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a novel learning paradigm: Feature Evolvable Streaming Learning where old features would vanish and new features would occur. Rather than relying on only the current features, we attempt to recover the vanished features and exploit it to improve performance. Specifically, we learn a mapping from the overlapping period to recover old features and then we learn two models from the recovered features and the current features, respectively. To benefit from the recovered features, we develop two ensemble methods. In the first method, we combine the predictions from two models and theoretically show that with the assistance of old features, the performance on new features can be improved and we provide a tighter bound if the loss function is exponentially concave. In the second approach, we dynamically select the best single prediction and establish a better performance guarantee when the best model switches.

The accuracy of analytical model parameters was tested by comparing simulated reflectance spectrum to the field spectrum. The results showed that parameterized analytical model could be used to simulated water reflectance spectrum well.

Concretely, by capturing the user's personalized preferences, a recommender system can return a list of recommended items that best match the user preferences by using collaborative filtering. However, in the big data environment, the heavily fragmented distribution of the QoS (Quality of Services) data for recommendation decision- making presents a large challenge when integrating the QoS data from different platforms while ensuring that the sensitive user information contained in the QoS data is secure. Furthermore, due to the common tradeoff between data availability and privacy in data-driven applications, protecting the sensitive user information contained in the QoS data will probably decrease the availability of QoS data and finally produce inaccurate recommendation results. Considering these challenges, we enhance the classic Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) technique, after which we propose an approach based on enhanced LSH for accurate and less-sensitive cross-platform recommendation decision-makings. Finally, extensive experiments are designed and tested on the reputable WS-DREAM dataset.

A variety of supervised CPDP methods and some simple unsupervised CPDP methods have been proposed. In a recent study, Zhou et al. found that simple unsupervised CPDP methods (i.e., ManualDown and ManualUp) have a prediction performance comparable or even superior to complex supervised CPDP methods. Therefore, they suggested that the ManualDown should be treated as the baseline when considering non-effort-aware performance measures (NPMs) and the ManualUp should be treated as the baseline when considering effort-aware performance measures (EPMs) in future CPDP studies. However, in that work, these unsupervised methods are only compared with existing supervised CPDP methods in terms of one or two NPMs and the prediction results of baselines are directly collected from the primary literature. Besides, the comparison has not considered other recently proposed EPMs, which consider context switches and developer fatigue due to initial false alarms. These limitations may not give a holistic comparison between the supervised methods and unsupervised methods. In this paper, we aim to revisit Zhou et al.'s study. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to make a comparison between the existing supervised CPDP methods and the unsupervised methods proposed by Zhou et al. in the same experimental setting, considering both NPMs and EPMs. We also propose an improved supervised CPDP method EASC and make a further comparison between this method and the unsupervised methods. According to the results on 82 projects in terms of 12 performance measures, we find that when considering NPMs, EASC can achieve similar results with the unsupervised method ManualDown without statistically significant difference in most cases. However, when considering EPMs, our proposed supervised method EASC can statistically significantly outperform the unsupervised method ManualUp with a large improvement in terms of Cliff's delta in most cases. Therefore, the supervised CPDP methods are more promising than the unsupervised method in practical application scenarios, since the limitation of testing resource and the impact on developers cannot be ignored in these scenarios.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2020.3001739","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9115238","Defect prediction;cross-project;supervised model;unsupervised model","Manuals;Predictive models;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Data models;Software;Testing","","","","","","","","11 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, IoT devices are limited in computational power, including storage, processing, and communication resources, to effectively perform compute-intensive tasks locally. Edge computing resolves the resource limitation problems by bringing computation closer to the edge of IoT devices. Providing distributed edge nodes across the network reduces the stress of centralized computation and overcomes latency challenges in the IoT. Therefore, edge computing presents low-cost solutions for compute-intensive tasks. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) enables effective network management by presenting a global perspective of the network. While SDN was not explicitly developed for IoT challenges, it can, however, provide impetus to solve the complexity issues and help in efficient IoT service orchestration. The current IoT paradigm of massive data generation, complex infrastructures, security vulnerabilities, and requirements from the newly developed technologies make IoT realization a challenging issue. In this research, we provide an extensive survey on SDN and the edge computing ecosystem to solve the challenge of complex IoT management. We present the latest research on Software-Defined Internet of Things orchestration using Edge (SDIoT-Edge) and highlight key requirements and standardization efforts in integrating these diverse architectures. An extensive discussion on different case studies using SDIoT-Edge computing is presented to envision the underlying concept. Furthermore, we classify state-of-the-art research in the SDIoT-Edge ecosystem based on multiple performance parameters. We comprehensively present security and privacy vulnerabilities in the SDIoT-Edge computing and provide detailed taxonomies of multiple attack possibilities in this paradigm.

With edge computing, video surveillance services can be certainly improved due to the handy resource provision for video storage and processing. Generally, to reduce the hardware and maintenance investment, it is a popular manner to deploy the limited amount of edge nodes along with the surveillance devices. However such edge node layout leads to the unstable service distribution and complicated data transmission across the surveillance devices and edge nodes, which consequently decreases the quality of the surveillance services. In addition, the service trustworthiness is suspected since the privacy information may be revealed to some extent during the data transmission. To combat these challenges, a trust-aware task offloading method (TOM) for video surveillance in edge computing enabled IoV is presented for minimizing the response time of the services, achieving the load balance of the edge nodes and realizing privacy protection. Technically, SPEA2 (improving the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm) is employed to acquire balanced task offloading solutions.

In this paper, an efficient film video scene detection method is presented by using a rough set-based shot fuzzy clustering algorithm for film. Equivalence relation theory is applied to group video shots into clusters. Initial shot clustering is performed directly by judging whether equivalence relations are equal, not computing the intersection of equivalence classes as usual. And excessive generation of some small classes is suppressed by secondary clustering on the basis of defining fuzzy similarity between two initial clusters. Afterwards, according to the characterization of film video scene, three types of temporal relationships between two shot clusters are introduced. We introduce a temporally and spatially integrated strategy for parsing shot clusters into semantic scenes. The scheme offers an efficient mean for browsing and effectively retrieving film video","","1-4244-0332-4","10.1109/WCICA.2006.1714048","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1714048","film video;scene detection;equivalence relation;temporal relationships between two shot clusters","Layout;Fuzzy sets;Automation;Image retrieval;Gunshot detection systems;Hafnium;Content management;Technology management;Engineering management;Data engineering","equivalence classes;fuzzy set theory;image recognition;pattern clustering;rough set theory;video signal processing","content-based video analysis;content-based video retrieval;film video scene detection;rough set-based shot fuzzy clustering algorithm;equivalence relation;fuzzy similarity","","","","10","","23 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When the imbalance ratio (IR) of data is high, most existing imbalanced learning methods decline seriously in classification performance. In this paper, we systematically investigate the highly imbalanced data classification problem, and propose an uncorrelated cost-sensitive multiset learning (UCML) approach for it. Specifically, UCML first constructs multiple balanced subsets through random partition, and then employs the multiset feature learning (MFL) to learn discriminant features from the constructed multiset. To enhance the usability of each subset and deal with the non-linearity issue existed in each subset, we further propose a deep metric based UCML (DM-UCML) approach. DM-UCML introduces the generative adversarial network technique into the multiset constructing process, such that each subset can own similar distribution with the original dataset. To cope with the non-linearity issue, DM-UCML integrates deep metric learning with MFL, such that more favorable performance can be achieved. In addition, DM-UCML designs a new discriminant term to enhance the discriminability of learned metrics. Experiments on eight traditional highly class-imbalanced datasets and two large-scale datasets indicate that: the proposed approaches outperform state-of-the-art highly imbalanced learning methods and are more robust to high IR.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2019.2929166","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8765367","Highly imbalanced data classification;multiset feature learning;deep metric learning;generative adversarial network;cost-sensitive factor;weighted uncorrelated constraint","Learning systems;Measurement;Task analysis;Correlation;Training;Usability;Generative adversarial networks","","","","1","","","","17 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The multifractal formulism reveals more ""hidden"" information of EEG by using singularity spectrum to characterize its nonlinear dynamics. In this paper, we explored the ability of multifractal to discriminate the EEG signals recorded from healthy volunteers with eyes open, epilepsy patients in the epileptogenic zone during a seizure-free interval, and epilepsy patients during epileptic seizures.

In common MAB problems, an agent tries to find the optimal arm without knowing the optimal mean reward. However, in more practical applications, the agent can usually get an estimation of the optimal mean reward defined as NoMR. For instance, in an online Web advertising system based on MAB methods, a user's near-optimal average click rate (NoMR) can be roughly estimated from his/her demographic characteristics. As a result, application of the NoMR is efficient at improving the algorithm's performance. First, we formalize the stochastic MAB problem by knowing the NoMR that is in between the suboptimal mean reward and the optimal mean reward. Second, we use the cumulative regret as the performance metric for our problem, and we get that this problem's lower bound of the cumulative regret is Ω(1/Δ), where Δ is the difference between the suboptimal mean reward and the optimal mean reward. Compared with the conventional MAB problem with the increasing logarithmic lower bound of the regret, our regret lower bound is uniform with the learning step. Third, a novel algorithm, NoMR-Bandit, is set forth to solve this problem. In NoMR-Bandit, the NoMR is used to design an efficient exploration strategy. In addition, we analyzed the regret's upper bound in NoMR-Bandit and concluded that it also has a uniform upper bound of O(1/Δ), which is in the same order as the lower bound. Consequently, NoMR-Bandit is an optimal algorithm of this problem. To enhance our method's generalization, Cascade-Bandit based on NoMR-Bandit is proposed to solve the problem, where NoMR is less than the suboptimal mean reward. Cascade-Bandit has an upper bound of O(Δłog n), where n represents the learning step, and the order of O(Δłog n) is the same with that of the conventional MAB methods. Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrated that the established NoMR-Bandit is more efficient than the compared bandit solutions. After sufficient iterations, NOMR-BANDIT saved 10%-80% more cumulative regret than the state of the art.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2020.2995920","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); program B for Outstanding Ph.D. candidate of Nanjing University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9104874","Efficient exploration;multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem;regret analysis;reinforcement learning.","Task analysis;Upper bound;Stochastic processes;Advertising;Learning systems;Reinforcement learning;Measurement","","","","","","","","1 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This article presents a strategy to realize independent and arbitrary control of amplitude and phase responses for circularly polarized EM wave by using a dual-phase hybrid metasurface that integrates both geometric and propagation phases. A beam deflector with tailorable amplitude is then designed to verify the proposed strategy. As a proof of concept of its practical application, a circularly polarized reflector antenna with high gain and extremely low side-lobe is implemented by the proposed metasurface. Experimental results are in good accordance with the simulation ones, demonstrating that the side-lobe of the designed antenna can be reduced by 8 dB compared with a reflector antenna actualized by phase-only metasurface. The proposed methodology and the metasurface can provide a new degree of freedom in controlling circularly polarized waves by simultaneous phase and amplitude modulations, which may trigger many interests in electromagnetic/optical integration and complex EM wave manipulations, as well as advanced meta-devices for real-world applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2996818","National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Key Research and Development Program of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9104016","Metasurface;circularly polarized wave;amplitude and phase;low side-lobe antenna;geometric phase","","","","","","","","","29 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In such an environment, end users submit their data analysis jobs to ESPs; ESPs process the data analysis jobs using their service entities. One fundamental and critical problem for an ESP is to decide how much compute resources to rent from each edge server under the constraint that the total amount of rental resources is no more than a specified budget threshold, so that the average makespan of the data analysis jobs submitted to it is minimized. This Edge Resource Allocation (ERA) problem is proven to be NP-complete by reducing the set cover problem to a special case of it. To design an approximation algorithm for ERA, we perform two transformations on ERA: first, we transform ERA into mERA by replacing minimization with maximization; second, we transform mERA into dmERA by limiting the possible amounts of rental resources to a finite set of values. We find that dmERA has several tractable properties that allow us to design Hermes, a provably efficient algorithm that approximates the optimal allocation. We demonstrate that the gap between Hermes and the optimum in simulations and Android-based testbed experiments are no larger than 4.78% and 12.43%, respectively. Hermes can also output a curve showing the trade-off between the average makespan and the budget threshold, so that an ESP can choose the right balance.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2020.2989307","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Collaborative Innovation Center of Novel Software Technology and Industrialization; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9088284","Capacity provisioning;edge computing;resource allocation;service entity.","Servers;Resource management;Data models;Data analysis;Parallel processing;Virtualization;Approximation algorithms","","","","","","","","6 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this paper, we focus on a privacy-preserving unknown worker recruitment issue. The platform needs to recruit some workers without knowing the qualities of them completing tasks. Meanwhile, these quality information also needs to be protected from disclosure. To tackle these challenges, we model the unknown worker recruitment as a Differentially Private Multi-Armed Bandit (DP-MAB) game by seeing each worker as an arm of DP-MAB and the task completion quality contributed by each worker as the reward of pulling arm. Then, recruiting workers is equivalent to designing a bandit policy of pulling DP-MAB arms.

This work presents TagMap, a practical solution that acquires BFs across commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) RFID tags in the physical layer, enabling upper applications to boost their performance by orders of magnitude. The key idea is to treat all tags as if they were a single virtual sender, which hashes each tag into different intercepted inventories. Our approach does not require hardware nor firmware changes in commodity RFID tags - allows for rapid, zero-cost deployment in existing RFID tags. We design and implement TagMap reader with commodity device (e.g., USRP N210) platforms.

Due to its application potential in multiple fields, such as market expansion, election campaigns, and cultural competition, numerous studies have been emerging recently. Despite these efforts, this problem has not been satisfactorily solved since not only finding a (nearly) optimal solution for cost minimization but also evaluating a seed set is computationally complex. Existing works either trade approximation guarantees for practical efficiency using heuristics, or vice versa due to costly Monte Carlo simulations. In this article, a competitive reverse influence estimation-based greedy (CRIEG) algorithm, which provides bounded approximation guarantees, but offers significantly improved empirical efficiency under the competitive independent cascade model, is proposed. The core of the algorithm is a novel estimation method that improves the efficiency by constructing representative sketches to avoid heavy repeated simulations without compromising its performance guarantees.

In real-world applications, these intra-camera labels can be readily captured by tracking algorithms or few manual annotations, when compared with cross-camera labels. In this case, it is very difficult to explore the relationships between cross-camera persons in the training stage due to the lack of cross-camera label information. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel Progressive Cross-camera Soft-label Learning (PCSL) framework for the semi-supervised person Re-ID task, which can generate cross-camera soft-labels and utilize them to optimize the network. Concretely, we calculate an affinity matrix based on person-level features and adapt them to produce the similarities between cross-camera persons (i.e., cross-camera soft-labels). To exploit these soft-labels to train the network, we investigate the weighted cross-entropy loss and the weighted triplet loss from the classification and discrimination perspectives, respectively. Particularly, the proposed framework alternately generates progressive cross-camera soft-labels and gradually improves feature representations in the whole learning course. Extensive experiments on five large-scale benchmark datasets show that PCSL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods that employ labeled source domains or the images generated by the GANs-based models. Furthermore, the proposed method even has a competitive performance with respect to deep supervised Re-ID methods.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2020.2983600","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9047945","person re-identification;semi-supervised;progressive cross-camera soft-label learning","Cameras;Training;Task analysis;Semisupervised learning;Manuals;Lighting;Image resolution","","","","","","","","26 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Analyzing driving behaviors can help us assess driver performances, improve traffic safety, and, ultimately, promote the development of intelligent and resilient transportation systems. While some efforts have been made for analyzing driving behaviors, existing methods can be improved via representation learning by jointly exploring the peer and temporal dependencies of driving behaviors. To that end, in this paper, we develop a Peer and Temporal-Aware Representation Learning based framework (PTARL) for driving behavior analysis with GPS trajectory data. Specifically, we first detect the driving operations and states of each driver from their GPS traces. Then, we derive a sequence of multi-view driving state transition graphs from the driving state sequences, in order to characterize a driver's driving behaviors that vary over time. In addition, we develop a peer and temporal-aware representation learning method to learn a sequence of time-varying yet relational vectorized representations from the driving state transition graphs. The proposed method can simultaneously model both the graph-graph peer dependency and the current-past temporal dependency in a unified optimization framework. Also, we provide two effective solutions for the optimization problem: (i)a joint optimization solution of representation learning and prediction; and (ii) a step-by-step solution of representation learning and prediction. Besides, we explore two strategies to fuse the learned representations from multi-view transition graphs: (i) simple alignment and (ii) collective fusion. Moreover, we apply the developed framework to the two applications of quantitative transportation safety: (i) scoring of driving performances, and (ii)detection of dangerous regions. Finally, we present extensive experimental results with big trajectory data to demonstrate the enhanced performances of the proposed method for quantitative transportation safety.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2019.2935203","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8798874","Representation Learning;Peer Dependency;Temporal Dependency;Driving Behavior Analysis","Global Positioning System;Vehicles;Optimization;Task analysis;Turning;Trajectory","","","","","","","","14 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To thwart this kind of attack, we resort to the k-anonymity privacy concept to design secure threshold deduplication protocols. Specifically, we have devised a novel cryptographic primitive called ""dispersed convergent encryption"" (DCE) scheme, and proposed two different constructions of it. With these DCE schemes, we successfully construct secure threshold deduplication protocols that do not rely on any trusted third party. Our protocols not only support confidentiality protections and ownership verifications, but also enjoy formal security guarantee against template side-channel attacks even when the cloud server could be a ""covert adversary"" who may violate the predefined threshold and perform deduplication covertly.

They employ the program spectrum, such as code coverage profile with test verdicts, to rank the program entities based on their code suspiciousness. In the past decades, researchers have proposed many approaches to optimize these techniques; however, the program structure, which can influence their performance, is not taken into consideration in developing and improving these techniques. In this article, we identify and analyze the effect of the program structure on the application of SBFL techniques. We observe that some specific program structures may introduce structure bias to code suspiciousness and negatively influence the output of SBFL techniques. To mitigate these effects and improve the performance of fault localization, we propose Delta4Ts, a structure-aware technique. Delta4Ts references debugging history to alleviate the impact of structure bias in the calculation of code suspiciousness.

The goal is to meet the service delay requirements of vehicular edge computing with minimum migration cost and travel time. As service migration and mobility optimization are coupled, the joint scheduling problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality, which cannot be solved in real time by centralized algorithms. To this end, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm is proposed to maximize the composite utility of communication, computing, and route planning in a distributed way. In the MADRL algorithm, a two-branch convolution based deep Q-network is constructed to coordinate migration action and routing action.

Existing workflow refactoring approaches mostly focus on maximizing concurrency according to dependences between activities, but do not consider the block-structuredness of the refactored workflow. It is easier to comprehend and analyze a workflow that is block-structured and to transform it into BPEL-like processes. In this paper, we aim at maximizing both concurrency and block-structuredness. Nevertheless, not all workflows can be refactored with a block-structured representation, and it is intractable to make sure that the refactored workflows are as block-structured as possible. We first define a well-formed dependence pattern of activities. The control flow among the activities in this pattern can be represented in block-structured forms with maximized concurrency. Then, we propose a greedy heuristics-based graph reduction approach to recursively find such patterns. In this way, the resulting workflow is with maximized concurrency and its block-structuredness approximates optimality.

In view of this challenge, in this article, we develop a MET amorphic T esting approach to assessing and validating unsupervised machine LE arning systems, abbreviated as mettle. Our approach provides a new way to unveil the (possibly latent) characteristics of various machine learning systems, by explicitly considering the specific expectations and requirements of these systems from individual users’ perspectives.

We have performed an experiment and a user evaluation study to evaluate the viability and effectiveness of mettle. Our experiment and user evaluation study have shown that, guided by user-defined MR-based adequacy criteria, end users are able to assess, validate, and select appropriate clustering systems in accordance with their own specific needs.

We find that the manufacturer extends the product line when the unit fit cost, the green cost, the quality cost, the market scale of low-segment consumers, and the environmental responsibility level (or unit environmental cost) are low. In the presence of two products with different market positioning, our analysis reveals that: first, owing to the consumer's self-selection behavior, product quality and greenness may be distorted from the efficient quality and greenness; second, product line extension may improve both the environmental performance and the manufacturer's utility, i.e., achieving a win–win outcome; and third, a higher unit environmental cost (environmental responsibility level or a longer product line) will improve the environmental performance if the unit environmental cost is high.

Based on user request descriptions and evaluation, a connection relation is built to present which two users could be in a group. Semi-groups can be derived from the connection relation and two grouping schemes satisfying the group size limit are further determined through proposed algorithms to meet different service expectations.

To analyze the conformance of a process instance to its process definition, we seek a process reference trace ""best-fitting"" the instance trace such that the conformance degree of the input trace to the process equals the consistency degree of both traces. We measure the consistency between two traces based on their activity dependences.

But privacy concerns are one of the major obstacles to making use of public cloud platforms. Multidimensional anonymisation, a global-recoding generalisation scheme for privacy-preserving data publishing, has been a recent focus due to its capability of balancing data obfuscation and usability. Existing multidimensional anonymisation methods suffer from scalability problems when handling big data due to the impractical serial I/O cost. Given the recursive feature of multidimensional anonymisation, parallelisation is an ideal solution to scalability issues. However, it is still a challenge to use existing distributed and parallel paradigms directly for recursive computation. In this paper, we propose a scalable approach for big data multidimensional anonymisation based on MapReduce, a state-of-the-art data processing paradigm. Our basic idea is to partition a data set recursively into smaller partitions using MapReduce until all partitions can fit in the memory of a computing node. A tree indexing structure is proposed to achieve recursive computation. Moreover, we show the applicability of our approach to differential privacy. Experimental results on real-life data demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve the scalability of multidimensional anonymisation over existing methods.","2332-7790","","10.1109/TBDATA.2017.2787661","New Zealand Marsden Fund; FRDF University of Auckland; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8240631","Big data;Privacy preservation;MapReduce;Data anonymisation;Differential privacy","Data privacy;Big Data;Privacy;Scalability;Cloud computing;Partitioning algorithms;Indexing","","","","2","","","","27 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

It is shown that the presence of the RPN with a suitable anode recess depth can generate an electric field (EF) opposite to the built-in EF at the center of the second top p-n junction, which can decrease the EF peak intensity and make the electric field more uniformly distributed inside the device.

Each fiber tip not only works in reflection mode, but also acts as the collection lens for the transmission mode of the other side's excitation. The hollow-core all-fiber structure could extend the interaction length between the samples and pump laser. Moreover, the Raman signal collection mechanism was significantly improved. With the combination of both Raman excitation modes, a Raman signal with two times of magnitude enhancement is observed in experiment and it agrees well with the theoretical analysis.

When the reverse bias V is below 12 V, the leakage current is dominated by the variable-range hopping conduction (T<;250K) and Poole-Frenkel emission (T>250K), respectively. As the reverse bias increases (|V|>12V), the space-charge-limited conduction mechanism is responsible for the leakage current. It is found that the leakage current is highly associated with the defects density, as well as the trapping capacity of deep level centers; therefore, the lower leakage current of blue LED is mainly attributed to higher thermal activation energy Ea due to less deep level centers within GaN/InGaN MQWs structures.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2016.2600022","National Key Research and Development Project; Hi-tech Research Project; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; Solid State Lighting and Energy-Saving Electronics Collaborative Innovation Center; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institution; Research Funds from NJU-Yangzhou Institute of Opto-electronics; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7543527","GaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs);multiple quantum wells (MQWs);(I–V) current-voltage characteristics;reverse leakage current","Light emitting diodes;Leakage currents;Green products;Gallium nitride;Temperature distribution;Temperature measurement","deep levels;gallium compounds;III-V semiconductors;indium compounds;leakage currents;light emitting diodes;Poole-Frenkel effect;semiconductor quantum wells;space-charge-limited conduction;wide band gap semiconductors","reverse leakage current characteristics;GaN-InGaN multiple quantum well structures;blue light emitting diodes;green light emitting diodes;current-voltage characteristics;variable-range hopping conduction;Poole-Frenkel emission;reverse bias;space-charge-limited conduction;defects density;trapping capacity;deep level centers;thermal activation energy;temperature 50 K to 350 K;GaN-InGaN","","5","","16","","15 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The urban land-use change directly impacts the surface energy balance, and also alters the exchange of momentum, heat, and water vapor between ground surface and near surface atmosphere.

It is a challenging task due to factors such as variations in human shapes, body poses, and viewpoints. Prior methods typically attempt to recover the human body shape using a parametric based template that lacks the surface details. As such the resulting body shape appears to be without clothing. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based framework that combines the robustness of parametric model with the flexibility of free-form 3D deformation. We use the deep neural networks to refine the 3D shape in a Hierarchical Mesh Deformation (HMD) framework, utilizing the constraints from body joints, silhouettes, and per-pixel shading information. We are able to restore detailed human body shapes beyond skinned models. Experiments demonstrate that our method has outperformed previous state-of-the-art approaches, achieving better accuracy in terms of both 2D IoU number and 3D metric distance.

In this work, we consider a new task of visual information-infused audio inpainting, i.e. synthesizing missing audio segments that correspond to their accompanying videos. We identify two key aspects for a successful inpainter: (1) It is desirable to operate on spectrograms instead of raw audios. Recent advances in deep semantic image inpainting could be leveraged to go beyond the limitations of traditional audio inpainting. (2) To synthesize visually indicated audio, a visual-audio joint feature space needs to be learned with synchronization of audio and video. To facilitate a large-scale study, we collect a new multi-modality instrument-playing dataset called MUSIC-Extra-Solo (MUSICES) by enriching MUSIC dataset [51]. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework is capable of inpainting realistic and varying audio segments with or without visual contexts. More importantly, our synthesized audio segments are coherent with their video counterparts, showing the effectiveness of our proposed Vision-Infused Audio Inpainter (VIAI).
